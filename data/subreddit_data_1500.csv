0,Is refinancing student loans a good idea right now?,"Over the past couple of weeks or so I've gotten multiple junk mail ""pre-approved!"" offers. 

I'm inclined to be skeptical because no doubt a lot of these offers are predatory, capitalizing on the fear that student loan payments may once again resume in the US. One would lose all protections federal student loans offer - forbearance when necessary, the ever-present carrot of forgiveness - but the interest rate is 5% lower.

I'm sure that it's a case-by-case basis and I'll be doing my homework to see if it's a good idea for me but, if anyone else has already done their own homework, I'd love to peek at your paper.",personalfinance,1637563292

4,"Escrow Surplus in excess of $500 not refunded, twice","I recently took over the finances because I have greater attention to detail and had heard my husband say ""I thought we had more paid off than that"" when it came to our home loan. So I began to audit our accounts with the help of Moneyspire and good old paper and pen. I've nearly done with all the payments dating from May 2017 (origin of the loan) to present. And I've discovered some fairly alarming discrepancies. One being an an escrow surplus of $500+ from 2018 that was not refunded, nor applied to 2019. And then in 2019 they said our escrow had a shortage of $400 in April, so we paid that and the disbursements still went over by $200. Then in 2020 we had another surplus of $850+ which was not refunded nor applied to 2021. And then in 2021 they said we were short by $4000! They then did large installment payments of $800 for 5 months.. it was at this point it caught my husband's attention but then he got bogged down with his job and it slipped his mind. Massively inconvenient to me is that our mortgage lender was bought out earlier this year by PNC so I have zero access to our old statements at the moment. I have no idea where the money went or how we can get it back since I can't track it down, and I'm hopeful that PNC will pay it out to us but also scared they'll say we're SOL since the previous lender is gone. 

I have begun to compile documents for a complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in regards to the missing money.

14,Should I surrender my Life Insurance policy to afford a house?,"Long story short, I was young and was making a really good income well above the average at the time.  I was single and all, and my financial advisor suckered me into a life insurance policy with a dividend scale payout.  The plan was to have a retirement savings plan / ""tax shelter"" in which I can borrow against my cash value as collateral and pay interest to the bank.  That way, I wouldn't have to pay income tax on the amount that I borrow from because my tax bracket is already so high.  When I die, the payout will cover whatever I owe if I were to borrow.

I don't want to say how much I pay for the premiums, but it's a pretty big chunk of my salary (like 10%).  Even worse, the dividend payout sucks compared to inflation and my estimated premium offset keeps getting delayed year after year...

Fast forward today, I'm outpaced by inflation and growing number of high salaried workers and housing costs.  I currently own an apartment which is really love living in, but I would ultimately want to just buy a house as both a residency and long term investment and not have to deal with strata and all.  Unfortunately, I live in Vancouver, and houses here are super expensive.  I'd like to purchase the best house I can possibly get because I feel a good roof over my head is personally life's utmost importance.

All said, I do plan to get married very soon and maybe have kids, so it would help protect my eventual family in a forward thinking perspective.  But I just don't know if I should bother keeping my life insurance policy because it's eating so much of my capital.  I could just borrow against my cash value, but geeze... with the wild swings in the world today, who knows what's going to happen 20-30 years down the road honestly.  Borrowing against my cash value will also mean I'll be paying prime + x interest rate, which I think is around 4.x% to the bank.  I think my dividend payout might be able to cover that interest though.

So if I surrender my policy, I think I'll lose maybe 6-7k of my premium.  I've been contributing to it for around 5-6 years now, and I'm 35 years of age.

Can you guys let me know what your thoughts are?  Should I borrow against my cash value, or just surrender it, or any other alternatives?",personalfinance,1637559380

Car payment=$532(but i put an extra $100 a month so it makes it $632). Im trying to pay this off as quickly as possible so i have all that money free.
Gas=$400 a month MINIMUM(she has a v8 cadillac and it burns $100 per week on gas minimum which is crazy. We trying to sell it and get her a 4 cylinder suv. I have a honda civic $37 on gas a week approx.)

20,Should I lease a car?,"I drive a 2011 car with 150,000 miles on it, it still runs but has some issues such as the heat only working on one side, the trunk doesn’t open from the key (I had to run a rope from the emergency trunk release through the backseat, and pull the rope to open the trunk), somehow water gets into the passenger side floor from time to time and makes a puddle, and it squeaks every time I pull into any parking lot (I’ve tried to lubricate the suspension but it is just worn out and to replace the parts would be more than the car is worth). Right now the car’s value is around $3,500. I just started my first semester of Law school, so I had to take out about $20k in student loans. I also have about $20k in investments (I don’t use my investment money to pay my loans because my return regularly outweighs the loan interest). 

I have recently become worried that my car isn’t going to make it much longer and want to get the value out of it while used car prices are at an all time high. However, without touching my investments, I won’t be able to afford a used car that isn’t going to put me in a similar situation I am now…… worrying about my car breaking down. I have been looking at leases to find the absolute cheapest I can find, which seems to be about $240/month after paying tag fees and all that. The lease would only be 3 years, and by that time I will be employed as a lawyer making decent money…. And I could choose to buy the lease out or get something else. It bothers me that leasing is on the table but anything used that is worth buying to me (Toyota Camry) and that I could see myself driving for an extended period of time ends up being over $300/month in addition to at least a $3,000 down payment. 

I am pretty set on leasing, I know typically it is a waste of money because at the end you do not own anything, you are paying for the depreciation, etc. However, given my circumstances, do you think this is a fairly responsible decision?",personalfinance,1637557334

42,Roth 401k to Roth IRA early withdrawal,"I know that early withdrawals of contributions (not earnings) from a Roth IRA are tax-free. I also know that early withdrawals from a Roth IRA are prorated between contributions and earnings and the earnings part is taxable (including a 10% penalty).

The gray area for me is what happens when you roll over a Roth 401k to a Roth IRA? For example, 2 years ago I was able to contribute over the 19.5k 401k limit with my employer with after-tax dollars, and I was able to roll them to my Roth IRA to shelther the earnings from taxes. Now, obviously, withdrawing the earnings early would be taxable and would incur a penaly, but what happens to the after-tax contributions that I rolled over from the Roth 401k? Are those treated the same as normal Roth IRA contributions and therefore completely tax-free to withdraw, or do they incur some taxes or penalties?

Also, where are such rollovers declared in tax returns? I remember doing it a while ago but I can't find it in my turbotax documents somehow. I imagine that if the withdrawals are tax free, I'd have to make sure that I don't withdraw more than the amount that I declared back when I did the rollover.",personalfinance,1637552100

49,Is it time to switch job or stay on..?,"I’m 33 and currently a public employee for NYC. There’s hasn’t been much of a raise since I joined 9 years ago aside from switching divisions 2 years ago. My tier 6 63/10 pension will vest in a year so it seems obvious to stay on until then. I will have to buy back 8 years of credited service, however, since I didn’t start contributing until last year. 
I recently started looking as it was hard to resist testing the waters in this competitive job market. I just got an offer for a fully remote position that will give me a 27% pay bump along with most likely guaranteed 15% bonus and long term incentive payments. It also comes with a pension that vests in 3 years but the rate is 1.2%, lower than my current 1.67%.
On top of the pay bump, the remote arrangement will give me much more flexibility than my current FT in office requirement, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s foolish of me to forgo the city pension that’s so close to vesting. 
But also, I’m still 30 years away from retirement so the COLA won’t do as much to make up for the inflation. 
When I looked and applied for jobs 2 years ago, I wasn’t getting nearly as many calls and interviews as I am now, so I’m almost certain that it’ll be a tougher market a year from now if I wait for the vesting.

52,"(AR, USA) House/Car sell as one transaction &amp; Cap Gains from it","Hi - I am selling my house by owner and have a few questions about an offer I just received regarding the sale itself and taxes. (If this isn’t the best place for these questions please point me in the right direction and sorry in advance).

Location: Arkansas, United States
Home listing price: $470,000
Home purchase price: $370,000
Home ownership length at closing: 1 yr, 1 day

1. The buyer wants to purchase my personal car with the house - is that legal/can occur in the same Real Estate Contract? My parents have sold farm land before and included personal vehicles like farm trucks but is this allowed in a residential home contract? If the answer is no, just a separate transaction to handle this I assume? 

2. If the answer to #1 is “yes, it’s allowed in the same contract”, the buyer has offered the following:
	- Offer $505,000
	- Added the car as an addendum.
	- If the house does not appraise for $505,000 (expected), they will pay in cash the difference. (They are doing conventional financing for the rest)

	Will the bank/title company even accept this?

3. If I sell the house and car together, how does cap gains work?
	- Do I need to clearly state in the offer the house is for $470,000 and the car is $35,000? 
			House: $470,000 - $370,000 = $100,000 cap gains
			Car: $35,000 - $47,000 = -$12,000
				Can I even count a personal vehicle towards cap gains?
	
	- I want to make sure I do not have to pay cap gains on a total of $135,000 ($505,000 - $370,000)

How quick was your refinance? I have my inspection Tuesday and I've made aware to my loan officer that id like to close sooner rather than later. 

I know I can continue to work 80+ hour weeks until closing, but I wouldn't be surprised if my work shut down due to staffing shortages. Then my closing would fall apart. They might bring in an entire new agency to take over.

68,Mortgage: Best way to pay it off quickly?," I'm in the process of buying a home and trying to think through the best way to pay off the mortgage. 

Home price is $605,000. I had assumed that the most economical way to pay is what I saw my dad do: put down as much as you can for the down payment and pay extra every month you are able to.

But is there some advantage to paying the extra money in a lump sum instead of each month? E.g., if I put down 20% on the $605,000 home, then put an extra $100,000 into paying off the principal a year-ish from now, will I pay a lot less in interest over the life of the loan? 

The mortgage calculators say that in that scenario (20% down payment and then a $100,000 one-time payment about a year from now), I would pay $456,000 over the life of the loan ($383,000 in principal and $72,000 in interest). That sounds almost too good to be true. Does that seem right?

Alternatively, I could afford to put down a 30% down payment now and not make the $100,000 extra payment a year from now, but the mortgage calculators say I would pay $651,000 over the life of the loan ($371,000 in principal and $114,000 in interest). If that really is the case then it seems like the first option is a no brainer? Or is there something I'm missing?

I realize that others will have a different philosophical approach and will recommend keeping that $100,000 in the market rather than paying down a mortgage when rates are so low, but I'm not asking about philosophies. Just trying to think through the best way to pay off a mortgage quickly. ",personalfinance,1637548087
69,Considering purchasing property with the expectation of leaving the state for an additional degree in the near future,"Hi all,

I'm really just looking for some input.  

So I'm a 25yo woman living in Maine.  I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 2020, and am currently making about 60k per year (give or take).  I have a great credit score.

I've been renting since I was 18.  I'm sick of renting.  I pay 1200 a month for a only really decent 3-BR near a university.  I'm tired of the inflexibility of rentals, having security deposits wrung out of me.  I'm tired of shitty neighbors and landlords.  

I know that I can afford a mortgage here, because houses in Maine are not especially expensive (completely solid, nice 4BR in my neighborhood for about 189k) and that a mortgage payment for a much nicer house would be no more than what I'm paying in rent.  I've put thought in but I get a little lost in the uncertainty because I don't know exactly what the best move would be. 

The doubt comes in largely because I am planning on leaving the state to pursue a doctoral degree.  These degrees tend to take about 6 years in average.  I would be renting wherever I end up in a program - meaning, I would in turn also rent out the hypothetical owned property in Maine.  Before I start applying, I will have to do between 3 and 5 years of research. 

A big part of my income comes from providing shared living services to a disabled family member.  This person has no decent housing options aside from living with me. 

I'm considering purchasing a duplex, or a one-family home.  My dad suggested a multifamily unit would reap the most financial benefit. 

My list of pros and cons

Pros:
* My siblings will have somewhere safe and comfortable to live while I'm away (and pay rent to me which he currently does as well)
* I will earn some money on a rental property when I'm away (and potentially while I'm in the state if I go for a multifamily home(
* I will have the freedom and enjoyment of a home that is mine for the next several years, and then years into the future when I return to Maine
* What I pay in living expenses will actually go towards something meaningful, not in someone else's pocket 


Cons: 
* Renters can be unreliable, dirty, damaging 
* Concerns about significant costs accruing while in a graduate program (repairs, unpaid ""rent"", etc)
* Concerns about property management (who is trustworthy, what would they do)
* a duplex sounds financially more lucrative, but potentially less enjoyable to live in
* a home sounds most enjoyable to live, but there would be less to gain financially 


I've read some. But I'm ultimately very unknowledgable about the process or the ins and outs.  I think there's a way to do this where I would gain while I'm doing my doctorate in a way that the benefit would outweigh the hassle.  But I'm also assuming I've missed a lot of important details and factors I would need to take into account.

-Spouse and I make a combined 186k before taxes. Spouse is on probation at their new job, and will get two pay increases in the next 7 months bringing our total up to about 198k.

-Two kids under 5 (daycare is $1150 a month). 

-Current mortgage is $1350/month. We owe 220k on the home, and have around 200-250k in equity. 

-Cars are paid off, no other debts and one small credit card we use only for groceries and gas.

-70k in savings. 

-Both of us are putting 20% away in retirement and both have pensions. 

We need to move eventually because of my spouse's new job (both of us are now commuting north, with my spouse driving 2.5 hours a day). Our dream has always been to build our dream home. We have saved 70k in cash to put down for a land/construction loan. But property here in Oregon is extremely expensive, 100-150k an acre, and we would like a little bit of land.

We are thinking of refinancing our home and pulling 100k in equity out to purchase land. This way we can be picky about the land we get, we could use the equity in the land for the construction loan downpayment (our lender told us we could do this), and we could stay in our current home with our kids and pets while our dream home is being built. 

I feel like we're in a good position to do this, but I come from a poorer background so my instinct is to save, save, save and it frankly makes me a bit nervous to pull cash out from equity and I don't have any experience in doing this.

B) Borrow the tuition money via student loans and use their own money to invest in market index funds. 

Timetable on starting to pay back the loans is about 3 years.

I'm leaning toward B as the better option in general, because the interest made from the stock market should be higher than the interest rate charged for the student loans.

87,Best investment account strategies for a Canadian planning to eventually move back?,"Hey everyone, I'm going to be moving to California from Canada real soon, and was looking for some advice on which accounts/investment-vehicles to use based on my situation.

**Income details:** 

My base is approximately \~$145k with around \~$25k additional in bonuses and $20k in RSUs annually (private company). My company also has 401K match so I'll definitely be taking advantage of that. Taking all of that into account, I'm budgeting to hopefully be able to save around $50k annually that I would like to invest.

**Residency plans:**

I plan on only staying in the US for anywhere between 4-8 years. Since this isn't exactly a short timeline, I obviously would like my money to be invested so that it can grow, but I would want to move my entire investment portfolio back over to Canada once I move back to avoid tax complications from both countries. Since this would mean I'd have to withdraw prior to 65, I'm not sure which accounts to use (because of penalties and other potential nuances).

**My Options:**

So since I plan on withdrawing early and eventually moving my money back to Canada, I don't want to get hit with a bunch of early withdrawal penalties or other fees. For that reason, I plan on only investing in my 401K up to the match amount. After that, I'm wondering whether it would be a good idea to:

1) max out a Roth IRA and THEN taxable accounts OR

2) Put everything in taxable accounts OR

3) Unknown option I don't know about?

I'm not fully clear on American capital gains taxes, penalties for withdrawing early in these accounts (401k vs Roth IRA), or if there are other accounts that might be better for me. I also hear rumours about secret ways to withdraw early without much penalty, and have no idea how RSUs work in a private company, so just trying to figure out the most efficient way for me to setup all this up.

3,What's the fastest &amp; cost-effective way to pay off $25K of debt?,"# NOTE

The numbers listed below are an approximation, and accurate to within $50.00-$100.00 (I rounded). I also just started my new job making $70K a year, which is my highest salary ever attained. Before this I was literally making about almost $40K a year. The mortgage listed is a house that's under my name, but family shared bought almost 10 years ago. We've tried to sell it twice before and somehow end up with shitty buyers who asks for extensions and then don't qualify. As of now, it's under contract till the end of the year. The lender still hasn't sent an appraisal for it, my guess is the buyer doesn't have the funds for closing yet and they're waiting on the money from who knows what source. I was thinking of refinancing, but I don't believe that's possible while under contract. If the actually gets sold I am getting $30,000.00 in cash for myself.

No student loan debt, one semester away from a college degree but it honestly may not be worth it financially to complete it. I worked my ass off to get into a really specialized tech field. The industry's growing too fast and my company needs the labor more than they care about the status of my degree. 

I got into a really severe car accident a couple months ago. All my life I've just driven beaters, but after the scare I decided to take out a car loan to get something much safer. My new car's still an economical commuter car, 2017 model, bought used with 76k miles. I've $13k remaining on it currently spread out over 30 months. That's basically the only debt I have. 

However, I honestly feel really weird and out of place about my new income. I wanted to see if others relate at all. I feel incredibly grateful to have moved into the middle class, but it feels really socially jarring. 

I find myself having trouble relating to my coworkers in a lot of ways. Most were raised at least by middle class families, but there's a lot of people from very upper class backgrounds as well. We definitely spend money differently when it comes to eating out, vacations, etc. Most of them have had a lot of free time to develop fancy hobbies, travel, or go to graduate school whereas I worked 60hr weeks throughout undergrad to still not even really be able to afford it financially to finish, at to worry constantly about just the bare necessities. 

On the other hand, my immediate family still lives in poverty. Most of my friends are also poor/working class. For fun I do stuff that's free or really low-cost. 

Even dating feels really different between economic classes. I'm noticing that the middle/upper class folks I spend time with now get married much later, and are more inclined towards divorce if something is wrong, rather than trying to stick it out. What your parents think really matters because often times they're giving money in some form of gift for the wedding.

I honestly just feel a little bit alienated by where I'm at. Like I said, I don't relate very well to the middle/upper class folks, but now my friends and family are treating me differently with a weird attitude or trying to mooch. I try to just keep things low-key. In regards to dating, I honestly would rather date someone who's also working class just because I feel like there's more overlap in terms of lived experience.

I also didn't realize how much money really can buy- teeth, better skin, less stress, an easier time with sobriety, etc. etc. etc. I don't really think I realized just how little $15k/yr really was. I feel a lot of grief surrounding the ways in which I was deprived or just had to work ungodly hard.

I think overall I'm trying to just approach things with an open mind and to just treat everyone as people with the same insecurities, fears. Again, I'm really grateful for everything that I have, but I didn't expect the social differences to feel so big.

Since we've been married he has obtained a very high paying job, but lacked the determination to stay within a monthly budget. I have used excel, mint, and now YNAB for tracking purposes. Recently my husband wanted to spend outside of his discretionary budget on a $7,000 mountain bike. I cut him a deal, and told him he could purchase it if he read the books ""The Millionaire Next Door"", and ""The Next Millionaire Next Door"". Before he even finished the first book he decided he no longer cared about the mountain bike and wanted to be apart of the budgeting process for our family. All the work I have put into excel sheets and apps is now going out the window, because he claims the only system that will work for him is to have multiple debit cards. This isn't like the common multiple debit car system one might use for say living expenses, taxes (we are 1099), asset acquisition, and discretionary spending. He wants (which means I have to use this system too) a debit card for groceries, a debt card for fuel, for bills, for his recreational spending, for my recreational spending, for the kids, for the house, etc. That is A LOT of debit cards I do not want to deal with.

27,Student Loans and Opportunity Costs,"Hi,  


As of today, I'm now completely free of consumer debt with the exception of student loans. Over the past year and a half, I've paid off nearly $3500 of credit card debt, and a car loan of $7800. I'm incredibly thrilled with my progress, and now I'm ready to tackle the next stage of my financial future.  


Currently, I take home about 30-33k a year depending on my workload at a regional hospital. I'm currently enrolled in classes working towards an accounting degree part time on top of my work, so my student loans are currently in deferment indefinitely regardless of Covid legislation. I have about 34k in students loans from a previous degree that I've not made anything more than minimum payments on since graduation.  


I don't see any reason to pay down student loans at all given these various factors:  


1. I have no obligation ever to pay anymore than 10% of my discretionary income on these loans per my repayment plan (REPAYE).
2. My money is better spent investing in the market through my various retirement vehicles (403b, Roth IRA, HSA, etc.) The math doesn't add up in favor of paying down student loans to the detriment of these investment vehicles.
3. Once this second degree is finished, I will be eligible for a CPA license and therefore earning a much higher salary than I currently do. Even though my discretionary income will rise, thereby increasing my monthly student loan repayments, my overall income will increase to the point where I won't even notice these payments provided I keep to a minimally higher standard of living than I do currently.

31,Enrolling in healthcare.gov for 2022; I'm unsure how much much I should be spending,"I live in the United States, I'm in my late 20s, before taxes I make around $32k a year, I pay 20% of my monthly income on rent and utilities, I have 6 months expenses saved, no debt, and I don't live a very lavish lifestyle–– meaning I'm able to max out my Roth IRA each year, while also contributing a few thousand more to a brokerage account that I'm hoping to one day use for a downpayment on a house. I feel like I'm generally on top of my personal finances, but the thing I've had a hard time wrapping my mind around since turning 26 is my health insurance situation. My employer doesn't offer health insurance, and so I'm left to fend for myself on the healthcare.gov marketplace.

I'm currently healthy, I'm active, and I eat well. I have physicals every few years with my PCP and twice yearly dental cleanings, but otherwise very few costs. I theoretically could purchase just about any coverage on the marketplace and ""afford"" it, but it would be eating into my ability to save, and given my expected low use of medical care it doesn't feel to me like I need better/cheaper copays and deductibles. How do I go about figuring out what coverage I actually need? All of the plans I'm looking at are in the $20-$100/month premium after tax credit range.",personalfinance,1637538143
32,Wondering if it'd be good to sell my car and move to a lease to help pay for student loans. Any help?,"Hey all,

For a bit of background, I'm an engineer in Nevada. I graduated last year and have lived comfortably since. Like many people, I have student loan payments starting next year after the interest rate freeze is removed. I have $44k in student loan debt which comes out to almost $500 per month using the 10 year repayment plan. I'd end up paying around $10k in interest over the life of the loans with most of the interest rates being around 4-5%.


I currently own 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid that I bought last July for $35.9k financed at 2.9% with total cost after interest coming in around $39k IIRC. Monthly payments for that are $544, but I've paid off almost $20k of the car over the last year leaving around $21k left on the loan. 


Out of curiosity, I checked Carmax and Carvana to see how much my car is worth, and it came to around $32k. If I sell the car, pay off the loan, and put the remaining $11k as down payment for a lease of a Hyundai Sonata per se, I would be dramatically lowering my monthly car payments. I also wouldn't be paying for yearly registration costs (very expensive in NV - mine was $600 this year). I could then use this extra money per month to aggressively pay off my student loans as they have higher interest rates.

Would this be worth it? I understand that I wouldn't be paying to own a vehicle, but theoretically, this is the lowest my salary should be in my career. Giving myself some relief now then worrying about buying a vehicle later seems like a decent idea. Or would it be better to try to refinance my car loan and try to pay both?

Anyone have some perspective on this situation?

35,Financially Abused By Parents,"To making an extremely long story semi short. Family has always been upper middle class. Mother took out credit cards in my name when I was 18 and told me after the fact. Stated that she would pay them and I would establish good credit. She also let me a put a few things on them here and there. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but even if I did my parents were physically and emotionally abusive as well. I couldn’t even have an opinion in that household so I am unsure of what could have been done at the point either way. 

Later turned 26 and tried to be a productive adult. I download credit karma and realized my credit was trashed. Credit score-480 and realized that additional cards were taken out years later that I had no idea about. About 15k total in debt. The cards that were taken out when I was 18 were never paid off. Missed payments everywhere. 

My parents moved out of the country and I was pursuing a career in law enforcement. I did not pursue the legal route because it would have been a major pain in the ass to explain during a background check, mother was out of the country, and I did put some purchases on a few cards which would be difficult to prove/explain. I did contact some of the newer cards that I had no knowledge of whatsoever and they were closed and removed from credit history. 

Fast forward to now, I have been taking initiative and paid a few cards off.  Credit score is in the low 700s, salary is 60k, and credit utilization is 35%. However, the interest is absolutely killing me. It’s also infuriating to throw all of my disposable income at these cards. Anyway, I was hoping to create some breathing room and open a balance transfer card to pay the remaining debt off, but I can’t get approved….

37,What are the repercussions of someone else who you don't know having a credit card by your name and using it regularly?,"The other day I was with my mother in law looking at an app in her phone which showed all her credit cards to date and their on-time payment history. Now the thing is that since she's near her 60s she has had many cards in the past so she never bothered to check this section of the app as it was a long list (but not too long).

In the discussion she mentioned that she's maintained on time payments for all these years without missing a beat and was boasting of it. I ended up checking each of the cards one by one to confirm, since I thought this was an exaggeration looking at the number of cards she had in the list.

Now here comes the surprise, there was a card which had 2 delayed payments, one last year (Dec 2020) and the one before that (Sep 2019). Apart from these 2 months, all were on time payments, including the previous month (Oct 2021). At first, she said that it wasn't possible since she's never made late payments. But on further investigation we realised that she doesn't have a credit card from that particular bank in the first place. The app showed the last 4 digits of the card and she doesn't recognise the card and says she's never had it. The app had fetched this list of cards automatically, and I too have that app so I can confirm this list is (usually) accurate.

I'm not entirely sure how this is possible, but since there are payments happening every month till now since more than 2 years, someone's using it for sure. She has some vague memory of the bank issuing her a credit card which never reached her address and her having cancelled it after 2 such attempts. My guess is that someone got hold of the first one and the 2nd one got cancelled, and that person is using this card.

What are the implications of this? She wasn't too worried about this since her bank account doesn't have any rogue transactions (I haven't checked) but I suspect it might be some kind of fraud. Those delayed payments have affected her credit score slightly and I can imagine that being one of the implication, but what else do we need to be concerned about?

My mom has always lived above her means and she has stayed in debt pretty much all of my life. She has been a single parent for the majority of my life too.

&amp;#x200B;

Present-day:

She lost her job a year ago this month as a layoff during the Covid season. This was the best paying job that she had ever had and she had many absences from work due to just minimally not feeling well. I personally believe this led to her being laid off from work also. She tried finding another similarly paying job for a few months, but defaulted that there wasn't anything out there and she didn't want to work in customer service again. So she basically rode the unemployment all the way out until she could no longer get the benefits. She received money from my grandmother's life insurance for about $20k around the time she got laid off so she also had this money in conjunction with her unemployment. If memory serves me correctly, her unemployment didn't run out until around August/September of this year.

So around Father's Day, the house she was renting (because hers was foreclosed on prior to getting the job she lost) caught fire and she basically lost most of everything. She received a check for $16k and then moved in with my wife and me and our 4-year-old son. She started keeping him instead of us paying our neighbor to watch him, but she still has no job. Guys she has \*\*burned through just about all of her money\*\*. All in all, she would've had $36,000 but this money has dwindled down to $11k. She even had papers served on her last weekend for an unpaid credit card and she will have a judgment against her.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I know what is going on with the money is that she put the money in a joint savings account that had both of our names on it. (I had since opened a SOLE savings account in my name and transferred the money I previously had in the joint to this SOLE account to keep it separate). She told me when she had the papers served last week that she already has a judgment against her and that's why she's had the money put in the joint account so they wouldn't take it. 

I know her car payment is around $430 a month (because her credit is obviously crap and that was the best she could get), I know her phone bill is probably around $160 per month, and I know that she has different streaming subscriptions that I've told her to consolidate and just use what my wife and I already have. She consistently spends money on amazon, and insists on ""helping out with the groceries"" every week by creating pickup orders at our local grocery mart.

I am at my witts end guys. I am afraid this will soon start affecting my own family's finances. I've told her that once that money is gone I refused to pay her car payment and other expenses and she says she understands. It just makes me sick to see so much money pissed away on nothing.

73,Car Loan Before Home Loan Application," Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this. I was planning on applying for home loans toward the tail end of December. However, life always finds a way to kick you in the nuts when you're close to your goal. My car starting having a snowball list of issues. $3k into repairs and there's more things popping up every day. We think we should just cut our loses with this old car and buy another used car. I don't want to blow all my savings so I want to take out a $10k loan private car loan. My question is, how much would applying for a private car loan 1 month before applying for a home loan hurt me?

74,Need app suggestions,"So, I posted a few days ago about needing to turn my weekly paychecks into 1 monthly one. I took everyone's advice to heart about making a strict budget for myself instead and sticking to it. I did it! I made a budget for every dollar of my paycheck that I feel confident I can stick to with the right app/way to keep track. 

However, I cannot find an app that meets my needs. I get paid every Friday the same amount. No matter if there's a holiday or if I take PTO, it doesn't change. So I made my budget based on 52 weeks in a year (NOT monthly, since there are varying weeks in a given month). I have come up with what amounts need to be saved aside for every line of my budget. This is what I want to track - the amount every week for every line of my budget. How much have I set aside/spent,  and how much is left/needed (depending on the type of expense). 

Mint is the closest I have found that tracks in this way, but I can only input monthly income, from what I have found. Plus I hate that there are several premade budget categories to sift through constantly any time I want to do anything. I am desperate, but it's inaccurate to put in the same amount per month.

75,Confusion about California mortgage interest / property tax deduction.,"I heard that mortgage interests and property taxes were ""deductible"". I need some clarification about just how good this deduction is. Approximately 1/3 of my salary goes to tax, that's the extent of my knowledge regarding taxes. I am only interested in a ballpark rough understanding of what sort of values I am dealing with, I'm not trying to get precise values.

If I get a 500k loan with 3% interest and pay 25k per year (*in the first few years* it'd break down to 15k interest+10k towards the actual debt) with $3600 towards property tax. Would this mean that I have 18.6k deductible meaning that, effectively, that 18.6k comes out of my untaxed income. 

What I understand from that is, if there was no such ""tax deductible"" thing going on, I would have lost 27.9k from my untaxed income (9.3k towards various taxes that compromise the ""1/3 of my salary goes to taxes"" and 18.6k towards the interest+property tax payments). This tax deduction thing means I would be saving that 9.3k out of my untaxed yearly salary that would go to taxes, which means I would be saving approximately 6k/year thanks to tax deductions (in the first few years).

Which seems like a huge deal, sounds too good to be true so I want to check if I have any misunderstandings.

76,Amazon told the state I was a subcontractor during auditing; supplied an EIN number. I don't recognize any of it. How can I check?,"I worked at Amazon from Q3 2018 to Q1 2019, and received W2s for both years. I just got a letter in the mail from my former state's DOL asking me to complete a worker classification questionnaire due back 2 months ago (USPS mail forwarding). The letter stated that I worked at Amazon from 2017-2020 as a subcontractor with a listed EIN number. I have never seen this EIN number in my life. DOL is demanding copies of business invoices, insurance, advertisements, etc. I have none of these because I was a W4 employer. 

I emailed the auditor copies of my W2s; but now I'm concerned about identity theft. 

At best, this was a clerical error. The site were I worked had a terrible HR department. I resigned in February 2019 but they didn't process my separation until May 2019. At worst, someone has stolen my identity. I did have an issue with a Wells Fargo debt collection scam 2 years ago but that has since stopped.

Right now my rent is $600/month, I pay my phone bill, and take care of my dog. 

Right now I make $17.10/hr, in a couple of months it will be $18.45/hr, and by the time I move out I’ll be making $19.85/hr or more depending on the annual COL review my job does every year.

I have $10,000 in my savings account. I am hoping to have around $16,000 total or more by the time I leave. 

I do not have a license but am learning to drive and eventually will get a car sometime in 22. I will have a car note.

My plan is to move with $16k or more. I’ll have my first months rent and deposit paid, car insurance up to 6 months or a year, and have my place furnished and that’s about it.

78,My wife and I are planning on retiring in the next few years; do I need insurance?,"When we retire I will have about $1,000,000 in retirement funds. When I die that all goes to my wife. She has a defined benefit that lasts her entire life, but when she dies I receive half for the rest of my life. She also has insurance which will pay a lump sum worth two years of her salary. The only other insurance we have is on the mortgage - when either one of us die the mortgage is paid off. But we will not have a mortgage by the end of next year. 

When we retire we will essentially be debt free. Our income will not go down when I die but when she dies our income will be reduced by about 25% but will partially be offset by her insurance which I will receive.

I have an investment home in NC. I owe 46k on it with 13 years left on the 30yr term. Interest is 6.5%

I was planning to pay it off this next year, but my tax person suggested I refi the loan and let it ride.

I looked into the refi, and I'd get 2.99% on an 11-year term with closing etc fees of $5800 rolled into the loan. They need 80K as a minimum for a loan so I'd be getting 26k back in cash. 

I'm old fashioned and think to just kill this loan, but I get the concept of investing the cash over time and letting a low interest loan ride.

Or hidden option 3, is it better to rent for the next 5 years in the $1,500-2,000 range and put our 250k elsewhere? A CDC?

&amp;#x200B;

Details:

We are moving from a very high cost of living area (Bay Area) that allowed us to save a lot of money to a lot lower cost of living area (Columbus). We are moving in the spring/summer 2022 and will have $250,000 in savings. I will be going to law school while my husband can get a job in the 80-120k range. We are 28 and 30y/o and have first baby due in March, plan to have a second in about 1.5 years. Also have a dog and cat - which makes renting a little harder.

Wants:

We would like to buy a house in a hip neighborhood in Columbus that we would live in for about 5 years, close to jobs and city life which we both like. It will almost certainly be in a bad school district so we will move in the next 5 to a more rural area just outside of Columbus, where we both grew up to buy our forever home.",personalfinance,1637528305
85,Investment advice for a UK citizen living in Germany,"I've been living and working in Germany for around a year now and am saving enough every month that i think it is worth investing it. I understand the basics of investing but am finding it difficult to evaulate my options. To start with I'm not sure whether i should make UK based investments on Germany based ones (or even somewhere else?). 

As someone who is likely to move back to the UK in a few years a UK investment ISA account would be perfect for me but those are only available to UK residents. The level of choice for consumer-level investment in Germany is low compared to the UK. I'm looking for something relatively low-risk and without much management, so something like an index fund or managed portfolio (preferably a green one). I've seen fidelity do offer products here, but their website is only in German. I speak some German but not enough to read contacts, fine print, etc (though a certain amount can be google translated of course). I assume i would be eligable for certain type of investment accounts and products in the UK even though I don't currently live there but i don't know which ones.

Any advice is welcome, but in particular I am intertested to know which country i would be better off investing in (bearing in mind currency, residency and tax considerations), what type of proctuct (if any in particular spring to mind), and -  if i were to make a non-UK-based investment - what the process of repatriating my investment would be.

7,Planning for chronic illness with unknowns (multiple sclerosis),"How do I plan for the unplannable? (Chronic disease/illness)

I’m a planner, so maybe this is how I’m coping while trying to support my partner. We’re middle aged (38, 32),  no kids/won’t have kids and to this point we’ve tried to do everything “right” financially. She got a later start saving for retirement and we weren’t able to contribute much early on.  We are both nurses, making roughly the same income and bring in about 140k year gross. We have between 250k-300k across our retirement accounts mixed between Roth, 403b, and 401a and have an emergency fund of 30k. I out 6k in my Roth each year as of 2019, we put 25% of pre-tax income into retirement and get 8% employer contribution. It would be tight, and difficult to save anything, but I think we would survive on just my income with our current expenses. 

We own a modest home, that we owe about 140k on, valued in the mid 300’s thanks to whatever this bubble is. 

We both owe about 8k each in student loans we’re dragging our feet on paying back in full just in case there’s any loan forgiveness, and I should note my wife is finishing up a masters and her work is paying for most of it and we’re just paying up front each semester. 

My mother-in-law is “retired” and gives most of her retirement income to my brother-in-law to support him, but he recently got divorced and she had decided to move in with us and pays no rent and we buy all the groceries/supply transportation. I don’t know her financials, but I don’t think she makes enough to support herself even if she wasn’t still trying to support her adult son. 

Now all of this on paper probably sounds fine and possible on paper, and I don’t mean to brag, I know so far we’ve been lucky and we work hard to live within our means.  

Then my wife was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Now luckily, her onset of symptoms has gone into remission. She’s back to her baseline, but this is a chronic, progressive disease and I don’t know how to plan for it. She could have few or minor relapses and she could be functional and working for the next 20-30 years, or she could be unable to work, wheelchair bound or require full time care in 5 years. 

I’m not too concerned with affording her treatment while we are both able to work, we have good insurance and her out of pocket max is only 2k or 4K per year, but if she ends up needing full-time care that can be thousands a year, or some form of custodial care can be upwards of 100k/year. I transitioned to a less physically demanding roll than bedside nursing  so I could theoretically do it into my 70’s if needed, because I don’t know how else we could afford her care if she declines. 

Do we just continue with our current plan/saving and hope for the best? Do I need to pick up a side-gig to increase my savings rate? Should I stop saving and pay off the house cause that can’t be taken from us if/when we need Medicaid for her care? What can so do now to prepare for the worst case scenario?

She was diagnosed so quickly (which is nice because we can get her on DMTs quickly) but her only life/disability insurance is through work and I’m guessing she is blackballed from any private carriers now due to her diagnosis.

Sorry for venting.  Any directions on where to even begin preparing for the worst would be appreciated. I looked up some MS financial planning articles and they just say shit like “save for a rainy day and get whole life insurance!” And other advice ranging from no shit to that’s impossible. All of this is imposssible",personalfinance,1637524322

18,Making sure I understand retirement accounts,"Hey PF community. I have thought myself a financially savvy person and Ive done well enough for myself but ive come to realize I have not taken proper advantage of retirement accounts and now im trying to understand my options.

In the past my wife and I contributed to but did not max out 401k plans and we both took a while to get around to that as well. Neither of us has contributed anything to either Trad or Roth IRAs.

Next year this is going to be our finances while married filing jointly:

230k income
Variable additional income from cap gains and dividends (10-25k)
400k in brokerage accounts
150k in traditional 401k.

First plan is to max out our 401k contributiona which would be 39k with current limits. I believe our household income prevents us from making Roth contributions but the math on MAGI with dividends can be a bit confusing im assuming best to not even try.

I get that we can each put an additional 6k into a traditional IRA foe anothee 12k but my understanding is with our income and 401ks that we wont be able to defer taxes on those contributions at all so not sure what the point of doing that over a brokerage account is.

I guess you can contribute to a traditional IRA then backdoor that into a Roth and since I guess we couldnt tax defer on the IRA anyways we wouldnt have to pay additional taxes to do that? Is that right? That seems like I might be misunderstanding that process.

If not i guess past maxing 401ks just put rest into brokerage? Because i dont know why Id put into an IRA with zero tax advantage.

I know that a 529 for kids, FSA or HSA for some medical costs could be done also but have to think on what would be reasonable to put into those.

So what am I not getting? I feel like Im wrong on some of that like maybe how backdoor Roth works or MAGI or trad IRA deferral limits.

22,Workplace increased starting pay. Should I ask for a raise?,"Hi,

I’m an 18 year old college student who held a retail job for a year before moving to college. I am now a seasonal worker, so I only work there when I come back during breaks. When I first began working there, I was paid $10.50. After about 10 months of working there, they raised my wage to $12.50, and even tried to keep me from discussing it with my coworkers and made it seem like they had to pull a lot of strings to give me an “especially larger” raise than the others. I discussed it with my coworkers anyway, and came to find out many of my coworkers received the same raise despite having significantly worse performance (performance is mostly measured by how many store credit card sign ups we get. Two of the coworkers had gotten 0 in their entirety of working, while i and the other 3 or 4 people got between 1-5 signups a day.) 


Recently, I saw an advertisement of there’s saying the starting pay is $12.00. Should I ask for a raise? I’m unsure if I should because I’m only working the summer, month of December, and a week in November.


I’d also like to mention I am 100% aware it is illegal for them to prevent us from discussing wages. I was aware of this when I was hired and made sure my coworkers knew it as well. We discussed wages very often.",personalfinance,1637521304

24,Car buying advice,"For the past four years, I've been living in a city where it has been pretty easy to b car-free with my family of four. But, in about three weeks, we're going to move to a place where we'll definitely need a car on a daily basis. Thanks to my in-laws, we'll be able to borrow a car for a few weeks when we first arrive in the area, but we'll definitely need something of our own by the end of the year. 

I've lived in car-oriented cities before, but every time I've bought a car before have always just gotten used cars that I could afford to buy with cash. Given the state of the market for used cars and the needs of our family, I just don't think that's in the cards this time around. 

Since I've never bought a new car before, and know the market for cars is crazy right now with shortages and whatnot, I'm really curious for some perspectives on what we should do. We can afford up to $600 / mo in monthly payments, but would obviously prefer to go below that, and while fuel efficiency is important to us (my wife has really got her heart set on a plug-in hybrid), pretty much everything else about a car isn't. 

My specific question are: 

1) Would it make sense for us to lease since we have so little time to sort this situation out? Does leasing ever make sense? 

2) Are there any pitfalls we should look out for when buying and getting a car loan?

I currently have $415,000 in student loans mostly related to dental school. It's all in federal loans paying 5.8-7.3% interest. I was paying \~$2800/month using income based repayment with $2200 of it going to interest payments. The pandemic relief has allowed me to put a pause on things and not accrue interest, but that's coming to an end in March. I currently rent an apartment for $2200/month. Due to family issues, I've been supporting my family and have a mortgage on my parents house (\~$200,000 left with about $500,000 in equity). I make about $225,000/year and have $250,000 saved up (my intention was to buy a house to get out of the rental market, but I'm leaning towards managing my student debt rather than getting a home, not sure if that's smart). I feel like I'm am just wasting money with the student loans (and rent) and am trying to figure out the best way to address it:  


1) Continue with federal loans and existing repayment. Pay down some of it with the money I have been saving so as to reduce the interest burden and repayment period.  
2) Refinance the loans through a third party service at 3.11%

3) Refinance or get a HELOC on the home and roll my student loan debt into the house (30yr at 3.2%; 15yr 2.6). Wasn't certain if having the debt be structured under a mortgage amortization is the best idea, but the rate is lower. Any thoughts here?

4) Continued with income based repayment until I hit 20 years (I have 14 years left).  


I'm open to other options, those were just some that I came up with. I also feel like like federal loans are ""safer"" than dealing with a private company, but that's just my feeling not something based on fact.

So far the radiation and chemo have kicked ass. But, I know that there will realistically come a time when we will have to sort out her affairs. Hopefully it is 20 years from now when she is in her 70s, but id rather be ready for anything.

My mother has expressed she wants to leave everything to me (23, living with her since the pandemic started) to spread out for my three siblings (21, 28, 30). She also has a wonderful older dog and a condo she rents. 

So far I have only lived on college campuses and never rented. So I have no idea what I would have to do if that responsibility is passed to me. I work at a vet clinic so everything with the animals is sorted. I currently make 14 an hour working 30 hr (less right now) weeks. Before hidden charges, the place is 1400 a month. I really don't think on my current salary, along with a dog and a cat to care for, id be able to continue paying rent here.

My main concerns are less with the exact money of everything, and more so with what I should do to prepare. What should I discuss with my mother to make sure that, if the worst did happen, I would be prepared.

What are the first steps I should take?",personalfinance,1637519470

41,Rolling over $2000 for a new auto loan,"hello, just wanted peoples opinion on this.

i drive a 15 yr old v6 w carmax value ar $3400. i currently pay   $200/mo on it $6k/2.5 yrs left on the loan interest at 4.11%. $130 mo for insurance and about $60 a week for premium gas.

so on avg i spend $570 a month w this car.

would it be smart to just trade the car in for a car with a much better mileage? im looking at hybrids right now and some decent ones are going for 15k.

pros i can think of, gas would probably go down to $50 every 2 weeks or so since i mostly do city driving. insurance wont go up that much i think and ill be driving a nicer car

cons would be bigger loan long term. instead of no payments after 2.5 yrs, ill have more payments for the next 5, as well as the 2k on top that'll have interest. im not smart enough to know which one will be better long term but basically, should i tough out the expensive premium gas weekly for 2.5 years or should i just go ahead and trade? also credit score is 736. thank you",personalfinance,1637519065

43,Making a budget - TSP Question,"Hello all, I am 22 years old and working on creating a budget. I see a lot of advice to max out Roth IRA contributions - I do not have a Roth IRA, but I have two Thrift Savings Plans accounts, because I am in the National Guard and also work for the government as a civilian. I put in almost 100% of my monthly Guard paycheck (around $300/month) because I don't really need that extra income every month. I also put in 5% of my bi-weekly paycheck from my civilian job to get the 5% agency match. With this situation, would it still be recommended to open a Roth IRA and try to max it out every year? 

I am trying to set my budget up in a way where I can be putting as much money away as possible - however, my goals are more set on shorter-term because I have a goal of starting my own cattle farm in the future and want to set myself up for success for the beginning of that.

53,HDHP versus traditional - no employer contribution," 

Trying to get some advice about if I should switch plans during open enrollment. Looking for self only, 139k income. Let me know if I missed anything.

**Traditional plan**: Premium: $115.50 biweekly, $750 deductible/$2,250 out of pocket max, PCP/Specialist $30 copay (not subject to deductible), Other services covered at 90% after deductible, Pharmacy: $15/$30 (brand), max pharmacy cost $1000

**High Deductible plan**: Premium: $73.50 biweekly -no employer contribution to HSA, but eligible to add my own funds - plan to max out, $2800 deductible/out of pocket max, All services including office visits, pharmacy, labs/imaging are covered at 100% after the deductible met.

I currently have the traditional plan. I hit the deductible and will probably end the year with \~$1300-1500 toward the out of pocket max. Most of this is from getting two injections (not sure if I will get again) and physical therapy (which I plan on stopping before the end of the year). I see primary care for annual wellness (both plans cover 100%). I also see PCP/specialist 2-4 times per year…each visit for that is around $200. I get a generic drug every month cost would be \~$40. I also get some occasional generics maybe 3-6 times per year.

Networks are the same BCBS PPO and I only plan use in network services.

Not sure if the HD plan makes sense because I am one of those middle of the road spenders. I am hoping to spend less in the coming year by not doing PT and maybe not getting the injections.",personalfinance,1637516579

2) Transferred an entire Traditional IRA from firm A to Fidelity.
3) Transferred an entire Roth IRA from firm A to Fidelity.
4) Liquidated and transferred the entire balance of my Fidelity Traditional IRA to my current Fidelity 401k.
5) Transferred some very minimal residuals that came in after liquidating my Traditional IRA from the Fidelity tIRA to my 401k.

I should say that for #s 2 and 3, they partially transferred at first (whatever funds could transfer in kind) but then I needed to liquidate at firm A to get the remainder to transfer.

55,High energy bills and poor insulation (Scotland),"
I live in a 3 bedroom upstairs flat, it's a lot of rooms but it's not particularly spacious. One spare bedroom is used as an office as it's a box room, the other as a dining room/office. It's only myself and my partner that live here and we moved in at the end of last year. All 4 sides of the flat are external walls with no insulation, double glazing and loft insulation but it's not great.

We are paying a direct debit of £175 for gas and electric, our bills have been incredibly high even before the price of gas increased, we haven't had a price increase from our supplier yet. The radiators we have are very small for the size of rooms so we have the heating on all day, 12 hours per day, and we still can't get the temperature above 18/19 degrees. We used oil radiators to boost the temperature last winter and built up an energy bill of around £400 in one month, the oil radiators are now in the cupboard and we're using blankets, thermals, hot water bottles etc instead. I've bought reflective backings for the central heating radiators, self closing door gadgets to keep the heat in, we open and close the curtains with the sun to keep the heat in, we have thick curtains and rugs and comfy items around. It is still cold! We need the heating on all day, it's not really optional to reduce that. The insulation isn't great, but the landlord won't improve it and instead offers expensive infrared heaters, unfortunately the law states the property should be able to have adequate heat, it doesn't state how this should be done so there isn't much we can do about that.

We are using around £120 on gas per month and £140 on electric at the moment, just under £9 a day on energy. We both work from home Tue-Fri and both go into the office on a Monday (the heating is off between 8.30-4.30 on a Monday). We watch TV in the evening, don't have lights on unnecessary, no high energy PC's or lights etc. I have no idea why the electric is so high. We are getting a smart meter installed in just over a month but the energy account is already back in the red and winter has only just begun. We submit meter readings every 2 weeks at the moment and it's so depressing to see how much we are using. We have bought thermals, jumpers, a new thick duvet to try to keep warm without using any other heat sources, both our work desks are now next to a radiator.

I checked the kWh usage, between the 1st - 16th November we used 290kWh electricity and 1665 kWh gas. I've had a look at the average annual usage and it seems really high! Above the average for a 4+ detached bedroom house.

We are estimated to use 5760 kWh electric a year and 18777 in gas. Over £2000 a year in energy. Something is definitely not right. My energy bills have always been much, much lower than this. In my previous flat I was only using a quarter of what we using now, the flat was around the same size and there was also 2 of us living there, and that was in lockdown when I was inside almost 24/7. 

Something doesn't seem right but I'm not sure what it could be. Any suggestions or anything else I can do to try to reduce usage? It's a rented flat so can't implement many changes to the building itself, I understand we are using a lot of gas with the heating on all day but I'm concerned about the high electric usage. We will have more information when the smart meter is installed but there's no obvious reason for the huge usage.",personalfinance,1637516390

Apparently they’ve wired the money—it has left the IRA but not yet been deposited into the 401k. This was at the end of last week, so I’m willing to give it a few days to (hopefully) completed and get in the 401k account. However, I noticed in the activity log of the IRA, it shows:

EARLY DIST NO EXCEPT EARLY DST/NO EXCP
$XX.XX

I called Fidelity because I thought that looked strange since it shouldn’t be a distribution or tax-triggering event, and I wanted to make sure it was corrected if my assumptions are right. The rep told me it was done mistakenly and that he submitted a request to the back office to recharacterize the transaction as a direct rollover. He also said it might take 10 days.

I have no choice but to wait but I’m just curious to know if anyone has ever experienced this type of thing before.

And if/when it happens, will the transaction from last week’s description just get updated, or will there be new items  in the account’s activity log? I ask because presumably there wouldn’t be any money movement since the money will (hopefully) already have made its way to the 401k account.

83,Taking out a private student loan for two years worth of university. Help with thoughts!,"To preface this, I came out to my parents, got disown, and now I have to figure out how to pay for college amongst other things all on my own now that I have zero help from them at all.

I’m currently a sophomore at community college and I will be transferring to a four year institution for this upcoming spring semester. During my time at CC I saved up money and had my CC paid for via a student ambassador program at my college. So any fafsa, scholarships, and grants I got were all refunded to me which I saved up to pay for uni when I transferred because I knew I wouldn’t get any help from my parents when I came out. 

Anyways, this spring semester at uni will cost me out of pocket around $8k. Junior and senior year will cost me around $25k out of pocket. I have applied for scholarships so I’m hoping that costs will go down if I get any at all but I am also looking at taking out a student loan with Discover should I not get any other financial help. ~$34k is around the average amount of debt that college students get and with a job in software development I feel like I would be able to pay this debt off fairly quickly. I have a pretty good credit score but only over a year’s worth of credit history so i don’t know how low of interest I would get.

There’s one full ride scholarship I applied for that I have a really good chance of getting but I do not find out if I get it until April and this full ride wouldn’t start paying until this upcoming August. Assuming that I get it I would still have $8k I would need to pay for, for this upcoming semester. I do plan on getting a job for next semester to off set costs. I had a job at this beginning of this semester but I quit because the course load was heavier than I thought it would be. 

Does ~$34k for two years and one semester worth of uni for a computer science degree sound fairly reasonable? This is around the maximum amount of debt in private loans I’m looking at as of right now assuming that I’m not awarded any scholarships or grants.",personalfinance,1637509440

We are looking for: no minimum fees, we both have easy access to account and can have x2 debit cards, and that we can quickly transfer funds in/out (we had simple before and it took like a week for her funds to get added). 

Those are pretty easy - but we have some other features we are really trying to find: Visa (for Costco), has ability to assign things in “buckets” (even if this would be a savings account to link) and would prefer no foreign transaction fees in case we want to use this traveling. 

Schwab seems to hit the closest. Cap One and Ally are front runners but both are Mastercard over Visa. We prefer to have Visa for Costco but if a MC bank is really better than we could work around. 

We use Splitwise now but would prefer to move to a joint account for these shared expenses now. Any places or thoughts I’m missing?

Background: I'm 31 years old, make 45k a year in a chemical manufacturing job in Japan with a college degree in biology. I have 50k of student loan debt and 7k in savings. Paid off all CC debt last year. 15k in a Japanese pension fund that I can cash out if I leave the country. 


I've struggled a lot with finance in my 20s. Parents said they'd pay for school then chose not to a few weeks before my graduation. I wanted to work in environmental conservation but then panicked with the sudden massive debt. Ended up working at a hotel for a few years before getting my current job a few years ago, when I was finally in a position to make a dent in my CC debt and get some stability. I am on IBR with $0/mo payments on student loans because I live abroad.

I've thought about going back to school for years, but I can't afford it and my family is very unsupportive and says I need to grow up. Except, of course, for my grandma. 


She died this year, and she happened to leave me exactly how much money I would need to attend the school I want to go to. She left me no instructions on how to use the money. 



My parents I should leverage my international business experience into a high paying job back in the US. My friends think I should stay in Japan and just enjoy my life.

I've made LOTS of financial mistakes in the past when I earned a fraction of what I do now, so my finances are a bit lopsided.

Should my be savings be substantially higher? Are they ok where they are? Do I need to pump the brakes on discretionary spending and route more to spending?

**Assets**

* $175,000 annual salary
* $75,000 spread over investment accounts ($67k in individual stocks, $8k in VTI/VXUS)
* $68k 401K
* $8,500 Roth IRA
* Company equity (described below)


**Spending**

* Approx $4,500/mo in living expenses (housing, car, insurance, utilities)
* $1500/mo debt repayment (student loans, etc), with a target of being debt-free within 3 years. Current outstanding balance is about $37,500.

**Savings**

* 10% of salary into my company's 401k, of which they give me a 50% match
* $1,000/mo into VTI/VXUS
* $500/mo into Roth IRA - though I will probably have to stop doing this in 2021 due to income requirements. I'm exploring mega backdoor Roth IRA options in the meanwhile
* Anything else extra I find in my checking account after paying off monthly expenses I'll pop into some investments


Looking at this, I feel as if I'm on the lower-end of ok, approaching a questionable/danger zone. I've got plenty of credit available for emergencies, and my emergency plan is to pay the expense in credit, and then pay off that credit card with a withdrawal from my investments.

Now here's the curveball to all of this: I was recently granted a fat chunk of equity in my company. $300,000, vesting over 4 years. It's a pretty solid/reputable company, so I have zero concerns about the stock tanking - it should be worth at *least* $300k when I'm fully vested over those 4 years. I'm also going to be granted annual stock refresher grants of $75,000, each with their own 4 year vesting cycle.

So the question now is - how does this company equity factor into my financial health? Should I be treating this equity as a non-factor - don't even think about it, let it vest/mature, and don't factor it into my calculations? Treat it as my savings, meaning that my current path is viable?",personalfinance,1637503554

14,Maintaining a high credit score,"Thanks to this subreddit I’ve learned much about rebuilding credit and personal finance, and now that I’ve built a good credit score I want to maintain it. 

Three years ago I got a personal loan of $4,000 thanks to a co-signer, and I have one payment left on that loan. I also have two credit cards. 

After the loan is paid off will my score drop, or come to a standstill? I know that paying it off is going to look good on my credit report, but because the loan is responsible for the bulk of my credits growth I am concerned about having it gone! 
I don’t want to immediately go back into debt after it’s paid, but am worried  about having one less open account on record, especially one that has helped me so much. Should I just get another credit card? Get back into another debt?",personalfinance,1637501496

16,Is my supposedly crazy uncle right about investing in the US stock market?,"I will summarize this interesting family conflict we have right now quickly. I am 28, single w/no kids. I live with a grandparent, pay them $200 in rent, pay for my own car/gas/groceries, etc. Make $3,500 take home pay monthly. I was raised by my father, who taught me to live the ""Dave Ramsey"" way. No debt, if you have debt pay it off, debt is evil, do not even look at debt, etc. Like Dave Ramsey, my dad preached to live significantly below my means. Basically, I only need 1 pair of jeans, 1 pair of shoes... You get the picture. My uncle and my dad are both the exact same age (52). They both are polar opposites regarding personal finance. 

My uncle and I were out to eat 2 weeks ago. He told me everything my dad taught me about money is wrong. That if I do what my dad told me (pay off debt, save for an emergency fund, invest 15% of my income, live below my means) that I will indeed someday become so/so wealthy in his exact words. I asked him what he meant, he responded with some things basically saying ""a man with an experience is not in need of a man with an opinion..."" My uncle then went on to say that debt ***can*** be a good thing if used correctly. He then went on to say that he has used debt to become worth 6 figures (he only makes $38k a year working for a big box store, but he does invest aggressively in the stock market and has made some serious money because of buying stocks cheap in 2008 and 2020). 

I began to discuss things with him and he basically said if I was smart I would do the following: A) Take out as many credit cards a person can get there hands on with 0% intro rates for at least a year. B) Charge everything that is a necessity on them, pay just the minimum until the 0% rate is about to end, then balance transfer for a new card. Rinse and repeat this for as many years as possible (he did say get rid of the card the day they start charging interest above 0%). He then said to open 2 brokerage accounts (still not sure why). He said to get as much money to borrow from the brokerage account company and invest in stocks that have 10% upside for the coming months. Rinse and repeat. 

Before I continue listing everything he told me to do, I want to say my uncle is an idiot or is smart but is conveying it in a weird way. He is the only person I know who has truly dominated in the stock market (no options trading or leveraged etfs btw, just old fashioned buy and hold). To this day he has invested only $56k of his income in the stock market from his paychecks. If you combine is current stock holdings with his stock sales from the years, he has a net worth of $1,050,000. Yes, he bought and held Amazon, Wayfair, etc. 

My question is, if a person has good discipline, is my uncle wrong to say a person is better off to let there money work for them? He did practice what he was preaching to me btw (he took out 5 credit cards about 13 years ago when 2008 happened, put the necessities on them, bought Apple, Amazon, etc stock with the difference of extra cash and the minimum payments, and held the stocks, etc). Every bone in my body is telling me this is the stupidest thing ever, but it is hard to see a blood relative who literally did no work (labor wise) become a literal millionaire by simply altering his budgeting/spending/investing method to reflect how many ultra rich invest (with borrowed money). Honest thoughts on this. I might give it a try on a micro level (i.e. take out 1 credit card with a $5k limit, invest like him for 5 years, see what happens).",personalfinance,1637499969

21,Inherited property that has a mortgage. How much will it cost to buy it outright?,"My father passed away 3 weeks ago and had a trust setup for me and my 2 siblings to split everything. I am trying to figure out the math on what I would need to pay to own our family cabin that has a mortgage on it.

I will use nice numbers to try and make it easier. The cabin is worth $60,000 and has a $30,000 mortgage on it. We each own a 3rd of it. The math that made sense to me is the following:

House value - mortgage (60000 - 30000  = 30000).  This represents the equity.

Divide that by 3 for our share (30000 / 3 = 10000). 

I want there two shares so the individual value * 2 (10000*2 = 20000)

Add the mortgage balance back on (30000 + 20000 = 50000).

I would need a 50000 loan to buy the cabin.

I also have an absurd lease on a car I won't hurt all of you with the details of but obviously it's an immovable debt atm.

The question is, if I have some cash reserves built up and my income is as close to guaranteed as it gets. Is there any reason I shouldn't just pay off all the cards at once? It will cost me about 366 dollars extra if I paid the other 3 off over the next 12 months. If I pay them all off now that would leave me with about 6k ""free money"" for the next 6 months barring no excess income, aka can go into savings or I'll spend it.

25,Coinbase debt card 4% cash back vs inflation?,"Looking for the best way to look at the advantages of getting 4% cash back return for the using the Coinbase debt card on all purchases. Does this hedge itself against inflation? Or does the taxes payed later for selling the coin null this?

Why I choose to spend money this route. When you setup the card you’re spending USDC. This is pegged to the dollar so you are not liable for taxes, you don’t gain or lose money. This is the only reason I’m doing it. No tax headache for every little purchase.

I feel like this is no lose situation because I was already spending the money. It was a loss to begin with. So what I get back over time is a plus and potential growth.

Next I’m also looking at the Crypto.com debt card for the Spotify reimbursement (up to $12.99). Now this one you do have to stake $400 of CRO to be eligible for the rewards. This stake gets you 6% interest as well. I don’t see this as to big of a risk to stake $400 worth of their coin. Like what I said before I’ll be paying Spotify for the foreseeable future why not get something back and have potentially gains.

With all that said how would this fight inflation? Would this lower the percentages impact on my day to day living.

36,Yet another I bond question post,"There are my thought aside from the obvious ones. 

-	I bond’s rate will only last 6 months, and probably won’t stay this high 5 months later. Assuming it drops back to 1.5% from 3.6% for the second half, you effectively only gain 5.1% instead of 7.2 over a year, which makes it a lot less attractive.
-	I bond rates WILL fail back down to 0% or close to 0%, no one knows how many 6months terms, but it will. And when it does, you will have to cash out and move to other investment, and you will have to pay tax on the interest. It is interest, not capital gain, it makes difference. Sure, you don’t pay state tax, but depends on your income, it can be 20-30%. For example, you do get 3.6% plus 2.5% for the first year, but then rate drops to 0.5%, cashing it out will effectively mean you are only getting 70% of the 5.1%, which is 3.62%, on top of that you will very likely want to cash out within 5 years, (unless you want/expect that our inflation stays at over 5% for 5 years!) you loss 2 months interest too. As a result, what you will eventually get will be much less attractive. You could keep it in there and potentially taking a loss. doesn’t make sense. Whereas if you put it in investment account and buy some funds but never sell it, you pay nothing and only take out when need it or/and in your lower tax years.
-	in fact, we should never want to expect the I bond to go higher, the higher it is, the higher the inflation is, and causing the devaluation of your overall asset.

41,I have stupidly gotten myself into debt and I'm not sure what I can do to pay it off.,"Hi all, 

On a throwaway because I don't want this on my personal account. 

I am a 23F and full time student. I am currently in an accelerated school program, and because of this taking up every waking moment of my life, I don't have the time for a part time job. In order to pay for school expenses and the bills I do have, I receive a monthly stipend every month of around $1,300 from a scholarship. I pay $760/month in rent, with the rest of my money going towards miscellaneous bills and necessities like groceries. I do not have any money in savings. 

Over the past several months, I have been irresponsibly spending money on my credit card in order to pay for things like gas, takeout food, clothes and makeup for random events, and even a damn concert ticket. Why, you may ask? Well, there will be times where I am running low on funds, but because of my family's financial situation (which isn't terrible; they live comfortably, but my mother has spending issues of her own...) and the fact that they want to kick me out of the bird's nest once I'm done with school and can work full time, I am always afraid of asking for more money. My parents help pay for my tuition and a portion of my rent, so I feel like a financial burden. Thus, whenever I find myself running low on money, I automatically put it on the credit card, justifying it by saying I'll be out of school and working within a year and I'll have plenty of time to pay it off later. However, I've become severely crushed by this debt emotionally. My parents have no idea that I've racked this debt up and I'm embarrassed and too afraid to even tell them. My mother always drilled it into my head that I should ""use my cc like a debit card and pay it off every month,"" but one month of not paying it off has spiraled out of control. I really want to start chipping away at this debt now in order to relieve this stress and am actively trying to look into how to budget effectively.

I have racked up $1,900 in debt, with a $4,500 credit limit. My minimum payment is about $50. My card currently charges interest at 17.99%. As of right now, I don't plan on spending anymore money on this card. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can receive any supplemental income without taking on a part time job? I've decided that any extra money I get will go straight to paying off this card. Also, if anyone has any budgeting app suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it!",personalfinance,1637482067

First off, id like to state that i am not in any debt or anything. I have enough money to pay my balance.

Here's my situation.

I got quite fed up with my BoA travel rewards card after using it for about 5 years. So i have a bit of travel points to redeem. About like $150 worth AND I accidentally overpayed my bill this one time so its at a positive balance of about $90. so total about $240 worth of money on that card.

As I got fed up with BoA travel rewards card, I decided to open a new credit card line. Chase sapphire preferred. I'd like to start using it as soon as possible to get the introductory bonus points. 60,000 points after I spend $4000 in the first 3 months of opening. 

Looks like my very first expense would be buying a plane ticket going back home for the holidays. Which seems like itll cost about $480. 

Here's my question: If I purchase the plane ticket through chase with that credit card, how would I go about paying part of that plane ticket with the $240 from my BoA? I've done some VERY basic research which resulted in a basic answer of: NO i cannot pay off a credit card with another credit card hence why im asking.

This accident just occurred a couple hours ago. I was parked at a spot and a vehicle pulled up in front and asked us if we were leaving, but he noticed we were near a fire hydrant, so he said never mind I see why you were just idling there. But, I told him I parked there and there was enough distance away from the hydrant. So, he went back in his car and I started pulling out of the spot and started to drive around him. I got to the left of his vehicle and he started reversing which hit my passenger side door. He immediately came out of the car and asked if he hit us. We said yes and he said it was his fault and took out his insurance information &amp; license right away. We took a picture of his information. His significant other heard him say it was his fault and said something along the lines of “are you sure it’s your fault? We were reversing to make space to leave (where they were double parked)” she started to argue about how that makes sense logically and it’s not their fault. 

I didn’t think to call the police until after the fact. So, I called and the operator said police don’t show up to accidents unless there is an injury.

I have an audio recording of him saying it was his fault, that he reversed without looking and dash cam footage of him reversing into me (that hopefully saved).

My dad has diabetes and my Mom has arthritis. My siblings and I are not in the position to take care of our parents because we are young and still trying to establish ourselves. What adoptions do my mom and dad have ? How can they build or gain some money?

My dad has been growing increasingly depressed since the beginning of the year. The realization of all his kids growing up and he has nothing is hitting him. It is stressing me and brothers a lot because it hurts a lot to see your parents depressed. They deserve a break so much. 

Please guys anything helps. If my dad were to drop dead right now idk how we would survive.",personalfinance,1637474777
54,Student Loans and First time Home buying question.,"So our landlord of 14 years has offered to sell us the house. We've wanted this for a long time but we weren't quite ready yet. Originally, they wanted to wait until after the first of the year to do anything so we were planning things at that pace. But today they told us they want to do it before the end of the year.
I just got a job in August making 84k a year and under normal circumstances that would be fine. But about 2 years ago I was laid off from a job making 73k/year 2 months before our son was born. I was only able to find a job making 55k after the layoff and my wife of course was unable to work due to the little one and also covid. So as much as we tried to avoid it we had to use our credit cards quite a bit. 
I was finally able to get my current job a few months ago at 84k a year and we had a plan to pay down our credit cards. I also have 90k in student loans from the Art Institute Online which I applied for Borrowers Defense on since I was lied to more times than I can count from them. It was denied last year, but I have appealed it as I have more evidence. So now my loans are in a sort of limbo but still showing I have 90k in debt which is killing my debt to income ratio. I managed to get the credit card debt to look better by doing a loan so my revolving isn't as high. Our combined credit rating is about 775.
Basically I have 2 questions. One, what documentation can I show to prove my loans are in administrative forbearance and I'm not having to pay on them. And two, I'm going through a mortgage broker and have only just gotten them all the documents they needed today, can I even do this before the end of the year?",personalfinance,1637474521

65,Mortgage - Lower interest rate ads,"Hi /r/personalfinance

I purchased my first home just over a year ago. Recently I have been receiving a ton of advertisements in the mail from several different companies advertising lower mortgage rates. These advertised rates are significantly lower (1% average). Based on the information in the ads, my monthly payment would be a lot lower. That's great to free up cash flow but a lower interest rate will also save me a ton in the long run.

70,34 M owes heavy taxes and broke af,"So I have been scared to ask for any help with my finances pretty much my entire life and now I am completely cornered and have no idea what to do. I've been brainstorming for weeks how to get out of my current state of affairs however nothing is coming to mind which will propel me out of this aside from long shot gambling efforts (flipping NFTS, wholesaling real estate, risky investments). I have managed to wiggle my way out of situations like this before by working multiple jobs and currently I am trying to do just that but at this point it might be too late and too little.   


I am prepared to be roasted to hell and back for this but I had run a co owned roofing company for 3 years before I arrived at my situation. We had a successful business, making insane revenue and decent profits. I had regularly invested the profits back into the company while my partner made decisions that increased our liability and threw profits away. Eventually I asked to be bought out of the partnership to escape the liability of his decisions (often made without consulting me or made after I already said no). He still owes me about 90k. During that time I had begun chipping away at my tax debt (at the time around 30k). I paid off about 15k of that before pivoting careers toward insurance adjusting. I landed a 1099 position as an inspector which pays anywhere from 60k to 100k + a yr depending on the weather. After saving a fair amount (20k) of money my marriage fell through and we seperated. She took half of that and we have a child. My truck which I use for work broke down on me and I got talked into trading it in for a new truck. I still owed on it and the dealership said they would pay what I owe and I could be in a new truck of the same model and make for roughly the same monthly cost ($660/mo). This past year though there haven't been any storms where I am from so work was scant at best and now winter is here and I am barely getting anything.   


I am barely getting by without even counting saving money for taxes which is now at 40k. My ex has me paying her alimony + some for child support and I still pay for some of her bills on top of my bills. I have our child 4 days a week on top of that so pushing for more work has been hard as with everything else I can't really afford to pay a sitter especially now. I currently work 6 days a week and I am currently making about $600 to $1000 a week. My monthly expenses all bills are $3465. Before this past month I was doing okay as long as I could make moves into a secondary income but that never came to fruition.   


What I am asking after all that is can I make any moves that will allow me to get back on my feet, is there any help out there?   


I know that this is my fault and that I have made some really bad decisions since before leaving my company so. If you are gonna tell me how bad it is please feel free to do so. I am sure I could use the verbal beating. Hopefully it'll ignite something in me and I can figure this out. 

Also thanks in advance for at least allowing me to vent about it here. Sorry if it's hard to read through. I am panicking.

I have Minnesota(MN) based s-corp where my wife and I are employees(only employees). Been contributing to solo 401k(with Vanguard) for the last 8years both as employee and employer. We moved to Texas this year in July, planning to open a Texas(TX) based s-corp and move the operations from MN company to avoid additional MN taxes(9.85% Foreign Corporation taxes since don’t have a physical address in MN) starting next year. if I have to start new solo 401k I believe below are the steps 

1. Terminate the solo 401k with MN company
2. rollover the funds to employee accounts from MN company
3. open new solo 401k(with Vanguard) with TX based company 
4. start contributing to TX company starting Jan 1st 2022

84,Negotiating raise for staying after losing out on another opportunity?,"I’m in the position right now where my current bosses know I am interviewing for another job within our company but with an altogether different division. When I applied, I told my managers and they get notified anyway because it’s all internal. 

My current managers already have approached me to say if I get the other position they want an opportunity to counteroffer with a raise to entice me to stay. There are other aspects of the job I’m interviewing for that they cannot match, but financially they essentially want to make it worth my while to stay. 

My question is what do I do if I don’t actually get the other job? There is no guarantee here. I’m a good candidate but one of at least a few. My current bosses have effectively told me that I’m worth more to them than what I currently earn. But the potential for a raise seems to hinge on the leverage of leaving the team.

For what it’s worth, I’m not unhappy in this current job. I generally feel valued and find most of the work to be fulfilling. I would prefer the new position but will feel OK if I stay where I am.

85,What are your thoughts on IKEA,"I think you have to prepared to live in a world with less IKEA. Ingka, their holding company has nearly 30 bln euro is maturing securities by the end of this year. Sales have been plummeting since last year, two supply chain disruptions further down the line left shelves and racks empty or producing idiocies like offering boxes but no lids for them. They invested in keeping prices down while costs have been rising mainly with funding with long-term borrowing, but this makes it even harder to borrow under interest costs that are ridiculously high compared to if they went the path of going public. 

IKEA quickly becomes a textbook example of how series of bad economic and financial decisions lead to reduced working capital, lost market shares and ultimately going back to the starting point - a small furniture store in a part of Europe. 

So I think we are going to see strong reduction in number of stores in the US by the end of 2022. In Europe there is more fierce competition and things will progress more dramatically with pushing it back to only western Europe.

91,Paying off student loans now or making regular payments?,"This sub has been really helpful to me when I've posted before, so I was wondering if anyone has any input on something I've been thinking about recently. I have the following student loans (all federal) about to convert to repayment:

* \~$5,500 at \~5.1%
* \~$5,500 at \~4.5%
* \~$4,500 at \~3.8%

I have about $20,000 in cash, a job paying $95,000/year, and have low enough monthly expenses that I would be okay with having just the remaining \~$4,500 in cash as an emergency fund if paying it all off up front is the best option, particularly because my checks will start coming in at the end of this month, so by the time I actually make the payments I'd have more than $4,500 left over. I'm currently leaning towards just paying them off, except:

* I've read on here that you'd be better off making monthly payments and investing the rest if the interest rate is less than 4-5%, so it might make sense to pay off the 5.1% and maybe the 4.5% loans and just make payments on the cheapest one, investing the remaining cash. I-bonds currently seem like a pretty good way to beat the interest rate of at least the third loan, even if I just keep them for a year and pay off the loans afterwards.
* I've also read on here that paying off installment loans can negatively impact your credit score. My FICO score (according to my credit card company's monthly report) is about 740 and I can't seem to get it any higher. The only negative thing that my report notes is length of credit is low (5 years). I've never missed a payment, I don't max out my cards, and I don't apply to credit very often (I have a credit card, a store card, and these student loans). I'd like my score to go up, of course, but I have no plans to take out new installments loans after these so I'm worried that paying them off will negatively impact me.
* I've heard talk of widespread student loan forgiveness, which would be nice to take advantage of if possible. I haven't seen any indication of it happening anytime soon, but I would feel like I fool if I paid it all off only for widespread forgiveness to happen a few months down the line. 

Again, I'm leaning towards just paying it all off, but I'd like to hear anyone else's opinion on it. I'm mostly curious about the second bullet point above because I don't want my credit score to take a dive but I'm not really sure how much of an effect this would have. The potential for loan forgiveness and the potential to beat the interest rate through investment alone aren't really enough for me to hold off on paying because forgiveness seems unlikely and even if I could profit via investments, the returns on such a small amount don't seem too important. However, if I could beat the interest rate with bonds (or another investment option), keep the door open for the possibility of loan forgiveness, *and* improve/maintain my credit score by just making regular payments, I guess it could be worth it?

While I'm here, I also have a secondary question about these loans. My loan provider's website states that my payments begin March 2nd, 2022 but they will convert to repayment status on December 11th, 2021. Will interest start accruing on December 11th? If I'm going to pay them off now, I'd like to do it before they start charging interest.

My parents asked me to give them $1000/month - I've tried saying no but they keep pressuring me to do it and so I agreed. I'm a lazy ass so I just agreed to giving them a lumpsum for the next year tomorrow.  


Here's the weird part - my mom makes around $50K and my dad makes over $300K. From what I know they have 0 debt, over a million dollars in liquid assets (VOO and VTSAX), and a couple million in real estate (fully paid off). Why are they asking me for money? What is going on here?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I recently found out that my parents are partially paying for my younger brother's college ($40K), and my dad gave him an extra $10K, and brought him some high end gadgets (fully spec'd out MacBook Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, AirPods Pro, etc.). I didn't get any of that - I worked throughout college to pay for everything (I worked as a developer and then a consultant so I made good money and graduated without student loans).

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I never needed the money as I was making $40-60K/year in college - but if I had a little bit of extra money maybe I could've taken it easy and had a bit more fun? Or gone to Europe with my friends after graduation? Idk I just have tears in my eyes as I write this. Whatever I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is - will I be paying my parents this amount forever or can I stop when I decide to have more responsibilities? (kids, buying a house, car payments, etc.)",personalfinance,1637464390
98,Leaving the workforce is overwhelming,"My husband and I had our first child 8 months ago. He works 60-80 hour weeks and I work 40 hour weeks, so the household responsibilities largely fall on me.

I have a company car and the benefits are all through my job. I have a fully vested 401k and profit sharing coming up, but the stress of keeping up with everything is getting to me.

When I looked at other reddit threads regarding the most boring cities, those very cities were listed as being the most boring next to similar cities like Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Charlotte, Salt Lake City, etc.

Lastly, does anybody have any suggestions on great cities too move to that don't have the boring strip mall, no culture or things to do suburbanite vibe?

9,Tips for buying a new or used vehicle in this market,"Background: I wanted to keep my car a few years longer, but someone stole my catalytic converter, and repairs are very likely not worth it.

No comprehensive coverage, so a claim isn't an option.  I'm in CA with strict emissions standards.  It's a partial zero emissions vehicle meaning aftermarket works to a degree, but has to be part of some difficult ""Referee"" program, so would have to jump through hoops (not to mention aftermarket is still well over $1000 in repairs)

I really don't want to buy now and I'm hoping I can get by a bit longer since I'm currently working from home.

Has anyone had luck with programs such as Costco or employee discounts like Mazda's S-Plan, for example? Or is everyone pretty much paying MSRP or higher?

Since it's a seller's market, would someone likely give me a decent amount of money for my non-working car? Carmax maybe?

Used/CPO look really high, so if a car has high resale value like Honda or Subaru, I'd consider new over used.",personalfinance,1637461159
10,Paying off car loan early,"So, in Sept, my wife and I financed a new car ($34k) as a way to really link our credit together (married in May). I've paid off almost all the loan, but its only been 2 months of a 4 year loan. We both have 800+ credit scores, but I'm not sure how being married, and financing a loan jointly will affect our scores. I havent paid it off so o can keep the credit history on file, and I'm paying less than $0.50 a day in interest.

My question is: should I let the loan run and age, or pay it off now? I'm comfortable paying pennies a day in interest, and ill have only paid a couple of dollars in interest over the coming months. Will it help build a stronger credit file for us if I let it run, or will paying it off now have the same effect as paying it off at the 1/2/3/4 year marks?

We have no other debt, and are very stable financially and live well below our means, so this has no effect in our monthly costs. Just looking to maximize our use of credit scores as we get ready to buy a house (hopefully in the spring.",personalfinance,1637461103

12,Medical company continuously sends bills to collections,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, but I’m hoping someone may have an idea if anything can be done. 

I recently got a bill in the mail from a collections agency. Best part is - it’s a bill I NEVER received. I called the agency and find out it’s from a radiology bill from when I went to the ER over the summer. Apparently it’s not at the point where this will impact my credit so I paid it immediately (through the agency payment portal on site).  


I paid every single bill I’ve received. This was $40 and literally the cheapest of everything else I got (sigh), so it’s not like I just wouldn’t pay it. Anyways - I call the hospital who tells me it’s through an external radiology dept. I googled this place and they have TONS of reviews saying they just immediately send these to collections and never send a real bill. I called the radiology company and they pretend they sent me ONE bill. They didn’t, but even if they had WTF!! They also had my address correct so that’s not a problem. 

So I have two questions:
1. Will this definitely not impact my credit since I paid? I even called the collection agency and they confirmed again my balance is paid and it won’t impact me. 
2. Is there anything I can do to somehow press charges/report the radiology company out here trying to ruin people’s lives because they don’t feel like dealing with billing?",personalfinance,1637460749

I opened up a secured credit card (no other CCs) earlier this year which has really helped my score improve. I currently have 6 accounts in collections averaging at around $200 each (about $1100 total) and the earliest one only dates back to early 2020. I’m working part time while I’m school so the most I can pay is about $50/month although I’m thinking about putting a chunk of my tax return towards this debt. My questions are:
Would paying this off even be worth it in regards to improving my credit score?
Should I even try to negotiate the balances since they are already pretty low?
Should I prioritize any incoming medical bills over the ones I already have in collections?

Most of the knowledge I have on credit comes from credit karma and what I’ve learned on this subreddit so I honestly feel pretty clueless and overwhelmed. Thank you guys in advance for any tips and advice.",personalfinance,1637460439

Today we recived a new credit card in the mail (at out home) from Bank of America in my wife's name, specifically her maiden name which she hasn't had as her legal name in 8 years. 

My wife told me she has never been in a BofA branch, let alone opened a credit card with them. The first thing I did was check her credit report (the letter containing the card also included the results of a inquiry with Experian so that was the report I pulled from [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com)) and I did find the account showing it was opened on 11/9 and also that there were several soft inquiries from BofA on the same day. 

It also looks like BofA has been performing soft inquiries several times in the last 12 months (going back to December of last year).

We are doing all the ""normal"" things like locking down her credit and such but I'm curious if there is any way this could be a legitimate card, maybe a different card was sold to B of A? I know she at one point had a Toys R Us card that was converted to a generic synchrony card when TRU when under and it's been unused for years so I'm wondering if something similar could have happened resulting in this account. 

What most perplexing is that there are no hard inquiries on her credit report and that the card was sent to our mailing address, I'd expect that if someone was trying to run a scam they wouldn't send us the card directly.

Anyone have any ideas? I'm working on contacting BofA to see if they can explain it but given it's a weekend I'm guessing I won't get an answer for a few days.

28,Need some advice for some big life changes coming in the near future.,"Hello, 

 I'm just looking for some opinions/advice since I feel like I'm just too overwhelmed to think clearly and make important decisions between what I want and what's realistic. 

I have my finances pretty well taken care of, I think. I'm working a good job that I actually enjoy and where I don't have to deal with the public (yay!) And making about ~39k a year. 

I put 5% into a 401k with a 100% match from my company. 
- Roth IRA that is maxed out for 2020 and will be for 2021 and probably for the foreseeable future unless something drastic happens. 
-HSA gets 1700 a year, I believe. 
~30k invested, low risk (it's inheritance money that I didn't want to lose and it's doing pretty well actually)

My credit score fluctuates between ""very good"" and ""excellent"" on the credit karma app depending on my spending habits and refinancing and all that fun stuff but it stays over 720. 

I'm engaged. Me and my fiance have been together for 11 years and wanted to get married in 2020 but decided to wait Covid out..ha. So I never really wanted to spend a lot on a wedding anyways we're just doing a low key thing at a place next year for around 2k. 

We are both in are 30s. I'm 30 and he's 31. We want a house. We want kids. Like within the next year... 

We both make about 70k together. For now. It'll definitely be more than that within the next few years (he's working as an apprentice plumber and gets a lot of overtime plus is due for a raise very soon and will eventually be a licensed plumber-2023/2024-  making good $$). 

We have 15k in a high interest savings account. 

He has nothing else. No retirement savings. Not eligible for an HSA. 

We have very little debt. A $175 car payment (my cars payed off and we own one car together) and that is it. I use a Carecredit mastercard to pay for vet expenses and get rewards for it and it's interest free for the promotional period so I don't consider that debt. Credit card stays paid off. 

Only real issue is figuring out how much money we really need saved to be able to afford a house by the end of 2021 and how to increase his credit score cause it's only at like ~640.  

We would both be first time home buyers and I plan on taking advantage of state programs that help first time home buyers. Right now rent is outrages and I understand that there always other expenses involved in home ownership but I feel like rent is just throwing away money. I will never OWN my apartment. It'll never make me my money back. Just money gone...

And then also, he wants to get involved in investing and has shown an interest in cryptocurrency and I don't have any understanding of that. My financial advisor invested my money in a Roth IRA , anything outside of that is like gibberish to me honestly.

39,HSA + pregnancy (due June ‘22),"I’ll start off by saying I am incredibly ignorant when it comes to health insurance and how HSAs work. Previously I had a PPO but the past few years I’ve been on my husbands health insurance. Last year we didn’t contribute anything to the HSA account because honestly we didn’t know what the heck we were doing and we both have minimal health concerns. 

I am now pregnant and due in June ‘22 and we JUST started contributing. I know the deductible is $6k on this plan and they’ll cover 100% of costs after that. Which I think sounds like a good deal….but of course interested in any insight. 

My question is, since there is barely anything in the HSA account now, can I add a large sum or cash from my saving account to the HSA? And if I can, would this be considered “tax-free” once April ‘22 taxes come along? Trying to get ahead of this future medical expense and I feel like we’ve really messed up here.

41,I want to get out from under my car loan,"Hello, so three years ago my car was repossessed after I lost my job. I ran to the nearest buy here pay here before the repo showed up on my credit and ended up with a 2013 Honda Civic with a 30 percent interest rate. I know, stupid. But you live and you learn, right? Now I am three years into the loan and still owe around $8800. I got one of those ""we desperately want to buy your car!"" Letters from the dealership that I use for service work on it, and the Kelley Blue Book rating for the mileage and the condition is similar to what I owe. My father has also agreed to gift me $5000 so I can buy another car straight out and get away from a car loan and save some money monthly. So my question is, does anyone know if, if the loan ends up being more than what the dealership is willing to pay me, do I have to come up with the rest of the money for the loan right then and there? Or would I just continue my normal monthly payments until the car is paid off much sooner? Thank you much in advance!",personalfinance,1637452775
42,"Public employee (recent graduate), am I moving in the right direction?","Hello all,

I am a May 2021 university graduate who started working regularly in June.

I make approximately 60,000 a year (with yearly COLA raises).

I have no college debt, live at home, and my commute is legitimately 10 minutes round trip. 

The last six months, I have not been the most frugal/smart about my money. This is the first time I have had a regular income, ever. I have mostly spent money on frivolous things such as dining, building a sneaker collection, going out with friends, and a few other miscellaneous expenses.

 I have had a few expenses that were unavoidable and things I consider to be one time or yearly purchases, such as my car insurance (900), a new wardrobe for work (600-700, this includes work boots and outer gear needed for work), fees and preparation books for my engineering licensure exam (500), a leather fire helmet(1000, this is something that I have always wanted as I am a volunteer fireman and leather helmets are a tradition within the fire service. They are approx. 3x the cost than their plastic standard issue counterparts but are typically passed through generations. They also last an entire career), and finally a motorcycle. 

The motorcycle was $1900. I have always wanted one of those too lol. I found a crashed 2018 Kawasaki Ninja 400 with 4000 miles on craigslist, all it needs it new OEM bodywork, which I have sourced for approx. 450 (yes it has a clean title). I can turn a wrench so I can easily put this back together myself. If I really wanted to, I could turn around and sell it for market value around 4000-5000 and turn a decent profit. 

I have a car that is paid for and has plenty of life left. I also do all repair myself. From brakes and axles, to meticulous engine repair.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a bit OCD, so I did the math and **I have saved approx. 60% of my income** since starting work in June, that includes all purchases through today. I feel as though this is decent as I have not really been budgeting, but also is irresponsible considering I live at home and pay $0 in rent.

I have decided to start budgeting, looking to limit myself to around 600 a month for my daily expenses. This includes a gym membership (66 a month), and gas (200 a month), leaving me about 384 for other daily expenses (around 90 week). This is reserved for eating out, going out etc. I mostly eat at home anyways, and don't really go to bars or anything that often. 

In this case, I would be saving approx. 80% of my income monthly. The only other expenses would most likely be big ticket items such as car insurance, or performance modifications and insurance for my motorcycle.

Since I have a government job, I am vesting into a pension. 7% of my paycheck goes towards the state pension. I do not have a 401k. If I leave the pension system before I am vested (10 years), then I receive all my contributions back, or I can leave them in the system in case I return to the system. If I stay within the state system till the age of 65, I receive approx 70% of an average of the three highest years of my salary for the rest of my life. If I retire at the age of 52 (30 years of service), I receive a much lower percentage (somewhere around 50-40% I forget). 

Anyhow, I am curious as to what the best option for future investment is? I am planning to max out a Roth IRA each year. My parents are okay with me living at home for the next 6-8 years. My only real future goals are to buy a house whenever I leave my parents house and may be to buy a sports car in the next 2-3 years. What should I do with all the other savings? Invest in a savings account to allow the money to grow so I can maybe make a substantial down payment on a house in the future? Obviously I do not want to put all my eggs in one basket. Is putting 6K into a Roth IRA yearly enough for retirement? I know I am in a bit of a unique situation since I don't have a 401k. I don't know if I will stay in the state pension system forever.

Any guidance is appreciated.",personalfinance,1637452527

47,Speeding ticket went to collections and is now ruining my score,"Apoligies for the long read but I'm in a bit of a complex situation.

In 2018/2019 I recieved a speeding ticket for going about 10 over the speed limit in Ontario. I was a student at the time and didn't have much money and forgot to pay the ticket. Fast forward to 2020 and I finally found the letter and remembered to pay it. However it had already went to collections and now there is a flag on credit bureau accounts. The status of the collection is paid but the flag is still there.

I am now graduated from mechanical engineering and am working at an excellent company (rated one of the best employers in Canada). Despite this, I can't seem to get approved for anything that requires a credit check due to the collection flag on my account. I've already contacted both Transunion and Equifax to dispute the collection but neither of them agreed to remove it. 

It's especially frustrating thay I cannot get approved for anything as my girlfriend, who is a student and who's annual income is listed as under 10 grand, is pre approved for almost anything she applies for. If we apply for something under her name it would be me making the payments on it which I find even more frustrating as I'd be approving her credit with my money when I can't do that for myself. I've had a credit card since 2016 and have always paid it off and monitored my balance. 

Is there anything I can do to fight this claim and get it removed? I graduated in April and started work in June and am really just trying to start my life. I have no student debt and a great job and just really wish there was a way around waiting 6 years for this to get off my account. Any help will be greatly appreciated!",personalfinance,1637451709
48,High energy bills (UK citizen),"I live in a 3 bedroom upstairs flat, it's a lot of rooms but it's not particularly spacious. One spare bedroom is used as an office as it's a box room, the other as a dining room/office. It's only myself and my partner that live here and we moved in at the end of last year. 

We are paying a direct debit of £175 for gas and electric, our bills have been incredibly high even before the price of gas increased, we haven't had a price increase from our supplier yet. The radiators we have are very small for the size of rooms so we have the heating on all day, 12 hours per day, and we still can't get the temperature above 18/19 degrees. We used oil radiators to boost the temperature last winter and built up an energy bill of around £400 in one month, the oil radiators are now in the cupboard and we're using blankets, thermals, hot water bottles etc instead. I've bought reflective backings for the central heating radiators, self closing door gadgets to keep the heat in, we open and close the curtains with the sun to keep the heat in, we have thick curtains and rugs and comfy items around. It is still cold! We need the heating on all day, it's not really optional to reduce that. The insulation isn't great, but the landlord won't improve it and instead offers expensive infrared heaters, unfortunately the law states the property should be able to have adequate heat, it doesn't state how this should be done so there isn't much we can do about that.

We are using around £120 on gas per month and £140 on electric at the moment, just under £9 a day on energy. We both work from home Tue-Fri and both go into the office on a Monday (the heating is off between 8.30-4.30 on a Monday). We watch TV in the evening, don't have lights on unnecessary, no high energy PC's or lights etc. I have no idea why the electric is so high. We are getting a smart meter installed in just over a month but the energy account is already back in the red and winter has only just begun. We submit meter readings every 2 weeks at the moment and it's so depressing to see how much we are using. We have bought thermals, jumpers, a new thick duvet to try to keep warm without using any other heat sources, both out work desks are now next to a radiator.

Does the usage seem high for 2 people? In my previous flat I was only using a quarter of what we using now, the flat was around the same size and there was also 2 of us living there, and that was in lockdown when I was inside almost 24/7. 

Something doesn't seem right but I'm not sure what it could be. Any suggestions or anything else I can do to try to reduce usage? It's a rented flat so can't implement many changes to the building itself, I understand we are using a lot of gas with the heating on all day but I'm concerned about the high electric usage.",personalfinance,1637451513

59,I don't know how to budget and I need help.,"I'm 24. I make 44.4k/year. I own my car. And despite having the ability to save, I've just never done it. My take home monthly is about 2.7k and my expenses only total about 1.4k. I currently live at a house owned by my mother, to whom I pay rent. Rent is 1.3k/month and I split that with my current gf. She makes less than me by about half and has several thousands in medical bills.


So enough exposition, what's the issue? Why do I need help?


The house I live in floods during any major rain event. Through a grant from the city the house is going to be lifted several feet and following that my mother is going to sell the house. However currently we don't know if that'll happen next month, or a year from now, or at any point in-between. We don't find out the exact time it'll be lifted until January. 


Ok cool you're being forced to move out, so what? Still don't see the issue.


I was never taught how to save. How to budget. How to anything. I want to get a house because I think renting is a mistake as you don't actually gain anything from it. As of this moment I have maybe $500 in savings. I have a balance of about 1.8k on two credit cards. Now in my sole moment of brilliance, I've always paid off the full balance of my credit cards every month because I think the concept of interest is bullshit. I'm on track to do this this month as well. 

But every time I pay them off I just. Keep. Using them. $40 for dinner here, $100 on something else there. And it feels like everytime I get paid, all the money I make goes to paying off CCs and I never have money left to put towards savings. So now with having to move out, being constantly trapped inside a revolving door of credit cards, and having essentially no savings, I need to make a change. But my issues is I don't know how. I'd prefer to begin saving to buy my first home. But I don't know where to begin. Do I accept paying interest on my CC's to lower my monthly cost, so I can start saving sooner? Do I pay off my CC's down to zero and ""lose"" them? Stick them somewhere and forget about them so I can't use them? I just feel so stressed about not being financially able to move out when I need to and simultaneously depressed that I could be so stupid as to let myself get away with thinking everything would be OK despite me not saving. I don't know how to save money because I've never done it. I don't know how to budget for the same reason. Any resources, websites, videos, apps all that are great and much appreciated. But I've been through a bunch. I tried Mint, and shut off notifications cuz it kept yelling at me. Every time I try to start saving something I want comes out and without hesitation I just buy it.

65,401k loan to pay off mortgage,"Hi PF! 

37yo. I make about 50k, spouse about 60k. I am in a steady career/job. We are debt free minus a vehicle loan owing less than 8k and our mortgage with only 24k left as we’ve been paying very aggressively. Owning our home outright is a big goal, and we’re anticipating having paid off by about August - October next year.

We have a fully funded EF and both are contributing about 16% into our 401ks. 

So, I was messing around on my fidelity app and found that I could take a loan out right now that would pay off my home at 4.25.  Mortgage is also at 4.25. I would pay off by October of next year which would align with the current planned payoff dates. 

If I took out loan I would basically be paying it back with almost my whole paychecks, but could easily make do on spouses paycheck, especially without a mortgage.

Pros: The psychological factor of having our mortgage paid off now  and not having to pay interest to lender anymore really entices me. We’ve been going balls to the wall for almost a decade to get here.

Cons: I couldn’t find this answer anywhere: If I have a loan, am I losing out on investing for the next 9-10 months and is this short term goal going to drastically hurt my investments in the future with compounding interest? Also, having my paychecks tied up in case something else arises above emergency fund costs gives me a minor amount of stress.

I suspect I’ll hear that I should keep on my current path but figure I’d ask.

69,Help re-balancing taxable account for liquidity and preservation of wealth," Hi Personal Finance, 

When I first started out with investing, my dad had me open an account with Edward Jones. Over the course of a few years, I invested money into various mutual funds, which now total about 38k. They are Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and Invesco for the most part – and they have high expense ratios. 

I recently transferred them all in-kind to Schwab – which I already have a small individual account and Roth IRA with. The Ed Jones funds I transferred are in their own separate individual account. My goal is to focus on this “Ed Jones” section of my Schwab portfolio. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my specific goals: 

1. I want to mostly get out of the funds and get into index funds – eliminating high expense ratios that are eating my returns.

2. I want to take a less aggressive approach – I want to MAINTAIN capital, and I want to be LIQUID.

3. I want to use these funds (in conjunction with savings) to purchase real estate within the year.

&amp;#x200B;

This “formerly Ed Jones account” is already a taxable part of my Schwab portfolio – so I want to essentially use that cash to eventually fund real estate ventures. My goal is to get into real estate soon, and it is vital I maintain capital and liquidity. 

&amp;#x200B;

My last concern is that I have some capital gains taxes that will of course occur, so any advice on how to minimize this hit is appreciated, but I might just have to rip the band aid. 

I am attaching a link to a PDF of my holdings in the formerly-Ed Jones taxable account at Schwab. It shows the percent of the account, the gains / loss, etc. Let me know what other info is important, and I will provide it.

Thank you!

77,Transitioning from Full-Time Employment to Full-Time Student: What should I do with my current savings?,"I'm returning to school full-time this spring after working the last year and a half. I have previous student loans from my first two years in college. I've budgeted out my expenses and plan continue to take federal loans for the time being. I anticipate 2 - 3 years to finish up my degree(s). 

I am not sure what to do with my current savings in the meantime. My family is historically awful with money, so I'm not sure what ""good personal fiance"" looks like.

I know I want to keep around $6,000 as a liquid emergency fund. However that leaves around $17,500 in play. 

Some of the options I'm currently include:

1) Pay off my highest interest unsubsidized loans. The highest interest rate of some of my loans 5.05%. This would save me some money since current federal loan interest rates are 3.73% and the unsubsidized loans will resume accruing interest in January.

2) Invest in something. Currently I have 401(k) that my employer has matched my 6% contributions to, but I don't really understand how it work. I also have a small crypto investment, but that's to volatile for me to want to invest anymore. I've read some of the wiki here, but I'm still confused about where to start with investing.

3) Buy a car. I will be living within walking distance of campus, so I do not necessarily need one. At the moment I don't plan on owning one due to the monthly cost of gas plus insurance. Local public transit is excellent in the area. However, owning a vehicle is always useful.

Summary:

78,"Help me plan my way out of debt after graduation and a new, good job","Hey everyone, I am a recent graduate starting a new job with a base pay of 110k/year, which amounts to $9,100 a month before taxes. 

Because of reasons, I could not get student loans and accrued $25,000 of debt in credit cards, all at a high interest of 22-26%. My expenses are about $1800 a month, and I have about $6,000 in savings invested, no liquid savings atm. My credit score is 600, down from 750 in a year, but I managed not to miss a single payment, ever. 

My wife has a stable job and contributes to half the expenses (another $1,500 or so), and she has liquid savings for maybe one or two months.  

Our first impulse for the new job was thinking about moving to a bigger place, but we desisted for the time being. However, the next move is to buy a new car for both commutes, as our schedules and workplaces are too different to work something out with one car. We have a 2012 sedan with 89k miles that we own, and we would like to get a second car ASAP. 

What would be the best course of action for us to regain financial responsibility while also getting a second car? What is a reasonable timeline for paying debt, refinancing, getting a new car? Is a car loan a rational decision under these circumstances?

Thanks for your kind help and time, looking forward to everyone's feedback,",personalfinance,1637444679

80,"Out With The Old, In With The New 401K","I changed jobs in Feb of this year which means I can no longer contribute to my old company-sponsored 401K. My question is what do I do with the money now? 

My Current Situation:
Old Job 401K: Roth 401K in a Vanguard Trust Retire Fund managed by Conrad Siegel (Net Expense Ratio: 0.08%).
New Job 401K: Roth 401K in an American Funds Target Date Fund managed by Capital Group / American Funds (Net Expense Ratio: 1.05%)
Personal IRA: Roth IRA in SCHWAB TARGET INDEX Fund managed by Charles Schwab (Net Expense Ratio: 0.08%)
About 30 years to retirement

What should I be doing with my old 401K? I can leave it where it is, but I have heard that 401Ks that receive no contributions for a period of 3+ years can face some legal trouble when it is time for them to be paid out. I could transfer my old 401K into my new company account, but a net expense ratio that is 13 times higher doesn't feel like my best option. I could move my old 401K to my current IRA or I could open a IRA through Vanguard so that the money stays where it is, but I can actually contribute to it.

we had a solid place for years but the landlord let the place fall apart and we left on not-so-good terms, so we don’t really have any references either. should we try to find a place that will let just one of us apply and have the other move in as well? does that exist?

82,I have a plan but don't know if there's a better way to do this.,"So context of the situation first I guess. I'm 26, married and live with my mother in-law and brother in-law. The wife and I moved across the country to GA to help her Mom, Grandma, and brother, and so my wife could be close with her family. Grandma owned the home, mom and brother live with grandma on her retirement. Mother in-law has not had a job in over 2 decades, brother in-law is 14. Sadly grandma passed in January of 2021 and I've been the only income for the house. 

Since then I've been paying my bills, the utility bills, there car payments, my BIL and MIL expenses, food clothes, ect. We had started a savings and had it to about 10K, but it's been wiped out.

The house is payed for, so no mortgage. They owe 4,000 to title max at 37% interest, I owe 2,000 at 15% interest for my work tools, and we got a new car for 20,000 at 14% interest before grandma passed.

I haven't been able to get approved for a personal loan because of lack of credit history which is in part why I got a newer car, and my bank does not offer any loans. 

So my plan is to get a mortgage on the home to consolidate all the monthly bills into one at a lower interest rate. Im thinking maybe 30,000 to 40,000, enough the get my heaviest debts payed and then some for savings. On paper it seems like a good move, monthly right now we pay roughly 1,300 on just those three alone and they are set to go as far as six years. With a mortgage it could be around 700 if I'm doing my math right. 

I'm just worried about if there might be a better way to do it or if there is anything I need to look out for. Thank you in advance!!",personalfinance,1637443074

I graduated college several years ago and have been living with my parents since then, saving money for future education. But unfortunately living here has been taking a toll on my mental health so I hope to move out soon. 

I have a pretty good job now that I started in august – salary is around 40k a year but I almost ALWAYS get overtime each week. I live in an area with a decent cost of living (looking at places with rent ~800/month) and have amassed about 30k in savings since graduating. I am completely debt free, no student loans (bless you, scholarships), and I easily pay my credit card bill each month. I have relatively few expenses right now. 

However, im waiting to hear from medical schools on whether or not im accepted and will be attending next year. Because of this, I didn’t sign up for my employer’s 401k (would’ve only been in that position for a year or less before leaving if accepted). if I’m accepted, I will be quitting next summer and potentially leaving the area (one of the schools I’ve been waitlisted at is close to where I am now, rest are far). If I’m not accepted, I might stick around and complete a master’s degree for 2 years as my employer ~might~ pay for a good chunk of it, then reapply. 

I come from a low-income family that doesn’t really know anything about money. Im considering opening an IRA, but im wondering what the best use would be for the rest of my savings? Is there anything I can do with it that wont get me docked for financial aid if/when I fill out the FAFSA again? I plan to hang on to about half of it as an emergency fund. My family is pushing me to consider buying a house rather than rent, and offered to cosign/rent it out if I leave… but I don’t know if I want to be tied to this place.

Assume the S&amp;P grows an average of 8% a year.

Also assume the Motley Fool stock advisor stock picks ""on average"" outgrow the S&amp;P by 4x.

Does that mean the Motley Fool stock advisor selections grow an average 36% a year (8% x 4)?

I feel like 36% is the wrong number since the correct calculation might be more complicated than 8 x 4 = 36.

Also, if you can find a link that puts a number on the average growth rate for the Motley Fool stock picks (preferably on fool.com), I will be more than happy to look at that. I tried googling it but can't find a simple ""average"" anywhere.

Obviously the returns vary from stock to stock but let's say you just put $1000 a month equally in each stock pick. I think you'd get a ""composite"" growth rate, as if you had put money in an index fund.

It was on recall three years ago, I had the work done for free by the dealer, but the same issue has popped up again. Because the transmission was a recall issue, it was covered under a warranty even after the dealer fixed the problem, but only up to a certain mileage and number of months. 

I am 10k miles over the coverage allowance, and 6 months over the warranty. The dealer has flat out refused to cover it, even though the issue was on recall. The dealer and independent shops have quoted me an additional $5k-8k in associated costs to fix the issue. Because of this, I am planning on not spending another penny and will be selling the car to CarMax for about $4k- $7k. I am planning on pocketing the $3k I spent to recoup my loss.

I now need a new car, but given the current market it feels insane to buy with the shortage of basically everything. I am likely going to lease a car, then sell it back to CarMax at the end of the lease. I have found a national lease special on a nice 2022 car for $379 a month, 15k miles.

* Hospital billed: $13,087.25
* In-network savings: -$5,428.31
* Paid by Blue Shield: $6,127.16

$1531.78 is 20% of the MRI cost ($13,087.25 - $5,428.31), which is my co-insurance amount. 

I've already hit my deductible, but don't know if I've hit my out of pocket maximum yet (will need to call the insurance company).   


I'm wondering if there's a way to lower this cost - did a bit of digging and I see people saying: 

1. Negotiate / ask for a discount  / ask for a charity case with the hospital 
2. Ask for an itemized bill (heard this is hit or miss) 
3. Ask the billing company for a discount 

One more thing i do want to note is my MRI's were scheduled to use the contrast dye (helps with image resolution and detecting disease), but I declined using the contrast dye. I'm wondering if my bill can be lowered because even though the MRI's were scheduled tot be with and without contrast, I only did the non-contrast portion.

Unbeknownst to me she switched me to be the beneficiary of all 4 of her life insurance policies sometime before the dementia took over. After her funeral while clearing out her room in the group home I arranged in the last few years I found a manilla envelope with my name written on it with a letter and the policies inside.

In total, I recently received Beneficiary checks of $1,450,000. There are also roughly $260,000 in assets that are going through probate but based on the lawyers reading of our states law I will receive as the only blood child and no living spouse. However probate may take as much as 7+ months.

I am 38 years old. Married. 2 kids under 6. Our combined income is $160,000 after pre tax deductions. I have an SRP through work with a 5% match which I contribute 10% to with 75k in it. My wife has a work sponsored 401k with a 5% match which she contributes 5% to with $120,000 in it. We own a home with a value around $450,000. We owe $304,000 on the mortgage with around 3% interest. I have $32,000 in a savings account I maintain as an emergency fund. My wife has no emergency fund. We have no high interest debt or student loans left. I paid the last of my loans off about 2 years ago. We have one auto loan for about $21,000 with 2.9% interest (credit union). No other debt besides the mortgage and Jeep. 

I'm not financially savvy and have never had much money and grew up lower middle class. The extent of my financial knowledge has been to not rack up high interest debt, live within my means and take advantage of a work sponsored match.

My initial thought was this amount of money is way over my head and I have been interviewing several financial planners. They are getting back to me intermittently with financial plans which we are going to review together and see who seems the best. They all have basically came back with a ~1% AUM fee when asked. I understand I basically want a fiduciary who is ""fee-only"" but I honestly feel lost after interviewing about 5 now. The one who my wife and I liked most said she was not ""fee-only"" but ""fee-based"" however she said she was absolutely a fiduciary. She works for Royal Alliance. She was recommended to me by the lawyer I had been using for my Mom's affairs. She said, ""With that amount of money, you'll want a financial advisor. I can refer X, I'm not sure if she is the best but I can tell you she is who I trust and who I personally use"" but she also instructed me to talk to several and find the best fit. However the CFP fee-only I talked to was kind of gruff and said I might look into a wealth advisor. Two of the planners I talked to already tried to sell me commission based assets in the initial call and another had a ~2% AUM fee assuring me he could charge that much because he produced better returns than the competition. So after weeks of appointments and zoom calls I still feel lost. And $12-14 thousand dollars a year really seems wild at ~1% AUM. In the first decade that is half a home! They also all seem to think I need a team of a CPA and an Estate Attorney and I just see more dollar signs. 

I know a million dollars is a lot of money but not what it used to be. I want to make sure I am smart and secure it well so I can have a better retirement and help my children have a small leg up into adulthood. 

Should I be working with a financial planner? Or should I just open a three fund portfolio with vanguard at 33% across the board and stop worrying so much. I feel exhausted. 

I'm sorry if this is not the right place, I have read the sidebar and everyone seems to give me different advice and values the inheritance differently. And everyone I've turned to has wanted something from me for advice and has speculated wildly about a coming stock crash or hyper inflation or recessions, etc.

14,Beneficiary confused over late father’s 401k funds.,"My father recently passed away and I learned that I was a beneficiary on his 401k. My father’s wife (they recently married 3 years ago) was the one handling the interactions with the HR department at my father’s place of work. She originally said their was only about 50k in his 401k, then once she learned I was also a beneficiary, she gave me paperwork to sign and told me that I was only getting about 20%, which would be roughly 10k. I recently received a check in the mail for 100k from the death distribution of my father’s 401k and started wondering if it was a mistake and if they sent the wrong amount of funds to me. I called my step mother a couple of days ago and told her the situation, and she said I wasn’t supposed to receive a check because she asked the HR person to send all of the money to her so that she could write a personal check out to me for the amount I was supposed to get (10k). When I heard this, it raised a few red flags and I asked why she requested that at all when it would have been easier for a check with my designated share to get directly mailed to me instead. She didn’t have an answer. 

I’m thinking the HR department made a mistake, or my father’s wife has been lying to me about how much cash was available in his 401k to begin with. 

What should I do now? Should I contact the HR department at my father’s place of work?

20,"Triple check your mortgage registrations, assignments, and discharges at the Registry of Deeds","Argh.

I'm going to be a little vague here because the registrations are public in Massachusetts and I don't want to dox myself.

Anyway.  About twenty years ago I had a mortgage with a company who immediately resold it (they are blameless here, so we can ignore them).  They sold the mortgage to GMAC.  Then we paid it off about nine months later (it was a bridge to cover while we sold our original house, so our main mortgage didn't go over the jumbo limit).  I get mail from GMAC with the registered filling saying MERS discharged the loan at the request of GMAC.

Recently we were looking at moving and a title search turned up the discrepancy between the assignment to GMAC and the discharge by MERS.

GMAC went bankrupt in the mortgage crisis, and sold active mortgages to a different company.  But I can find no one who has records on the cussed mortgages.  MERS still exists, but they have no records on this.

It's going to cost about $5k to fix it if I need to go to land court.

22,Leave equity in house during refinance or max Roth IRA contributions?,"As the title implies, I'm looking into refinancing our home while rates are still low. My wife and I were in the low 700s credit score and locked in a 3.825% loan with Wells Fargo for \~$235,000 and put just over 20% down on the loan. Now we have about $80,000 in home equity, credit scores in the 800+, and I work at a State job that has an optional 401(a) Roth IRA with a max contribution of \~$19,500. I'm already maxing the company match contributions, so now I'm just trying to determine what to do with this house equity (if anything). The Roth annualized rate of return has been about 21% since I started small contributions in 2018.  


Is it better to work closer to paying off a 30 year loan and keep flexible equity in my house (putting all of it back when we refinance) or to max out those contributions to benefit from the big, tax incentivized gains in the Roth? I realize it might not be that simple since that depends on how much I might need to tap the house equity in an emergency (we always keep 6-9 months of funds in savings for small emergencies, but I realize the house equity could allow us to purchase another property or deal with a huge emergency).

23,Apartment trying to charge me an outrageous amount,"Earlier this year I moved out of an apartment complex owned by a national real estate firm. I had lived there for about 4 years and decided to get my own place.   
After I left I received a bill for about $1,300 identifying what I was required to pay. I did not receive any pictures/photos with it, although the apartment complex assured me I would (I didn't ask, they just pointed out that they would). So me, who doesn't pay a random bill at face-value, scrutinized each line item and then went back via email and issued a response. I knew I was dealing with a national firm, and knew these firms often were persistent because they had the resources to be persistent. So I set a firm tone.  
First and foremost, I explained that I was not going to pay the full bill and that I do not pay bills like this at face-value. But I also didn't contest a few of the line items. They were small values, well within my security deposit, and I didn't take any exception to them. I believed I legitimately owed on those. This was also an opportunity to find common ground and set an anchor for what I was willing to pay, and what I wasn't willing to pay without further rationale and documentation. Furthermore, I was willing to relinquish my security deposit to pay those bills I believe I legitimately owed on, and a little more to sweeten things a little.  

There was also some shady line items. For example, they were charging me for 3 months worth of electricity bills of which I had paid directly to the utility company. I had made sure to not only transfer back the electricity to the apartment on the exact day I was told by the apartment, but I also cleared my balance out with the utility company while I was opening a new account for my new place. The accounts receivable rep justified it by saying ""Utilities are usage based, so they are always billed a few months in arrears. Every utility bill charged to you was actually for a previous months usage; therefore the final bill acts as a “catch up” bill."" But I called B.S. on that because I didn't pay electricity through the apartment complex, I had settled my bills outstanding with the utility company, and the utility company would have come for me to pay any bills outstanding as I had a contractual obligation to do so and they could sue me for any non-payment.  
The apartment complex also tried to bill me for complete carpet replacement, complete countertop renovation, and replacing some blinds.  
After some back and forth with the accounts receivable rep, I decided enough was enough and told the rep that there was nothing to stop them from replacing or maintaining something anyway regardless of my length of tenure and charging me for it. For example, if I had lived there for 9 months they could turn around and refurbish (I mean, who wouldn't to get new stuff) and then turn around and charge me for it. That's what wear-and-tear laws exist for: to help protect renters from that kind of abuse. So I quoted down to the exact paragraph and section of my State's Property Code and defined the Wear and Tear law. I then claimed this was wear and tear given my extensive tenure, and that the longer you reside at a location, the greater the argument for wear and tear.    
I then tied up my response by adding a hyperlink to the Renter’s Rights webpage of my State's Attorney General. For example, the page described that wear and tear of walking over a carpet is not a valid expense. But if I let mildew gather because I was negligent in handling a water source, then that would be a legitimate expense. But given that the apartment complex issued no pictures/photos, I would essentially be taking their word for it being a legitimate expense...which I am not.   
I then told the accounts receivable rep that I would keep an eye out for further emails. I figured that name-dropping the Attorney General would send a message. That, and the company knowing that we have been in an unprecedented pandemic crisis and that the Attorney General would *not* be happy with a national real estate developer running a local apartment complex trying to collect outrageous expenses.   
I received no further emails until today. My junk box caught an email from this real estate company stating that they were willing to reduce my balance down to around $700 before the end of the calendar year. But choice and the use of language is really important. The email states ""We'd like to give you a chance at to resolve your balance at a reduced rate. If you're interested, you can view your account..."". I see this as ""We'd like you to pay us, so we're trying to sweeten the deal. We'd very much like you to take this deal, but we're not saying it is obligatory."" If this were simply a discount, they'd state as such and still demand payment. At no time are they demanding the payment, nor stipulating any repercussions of non-payment. Also, there's an unsubscribe from email at the bottom, which cracks me up. This very much sounds like they know that they have no real recourse, but they're nonetheless trying.

Any advice or recommendations on my story? Do you agree that it looks like this company is holding out hope I'll be empathetic to them and pay the full balance on expenses they claim I owe (with no proof) and which I believe is normal wear and tear? Anything I should watch out for? I appreciate any and all responses here.",personalfinance,1637434587

50,Timing real estate market in redevelopment zone,"I know it can be hard to time/predict the real estate market, especially since it is a hot sellers market right now. My house is zoned for denser residential development and houses that are in the redevelopment zone have been selling to developers for all cash and about $100-200k above “market rate” for houses with the same qualities outside of the redevelopment area. I assume there is a tipping point at which developers will stop doing high dollar cash offers but I don’t have a sense of what that number is or when it is likely to take place. The houses that sold to developers and are under construction now had selling prices that are comparable to market rate sales in my neighborhood for houses outside of the redevelopment zone so I assume developers are still offering top dollar and will continue to do so.

I was wondering if it would be possible to put about $50 dollers in some kind of popular stock. Then after about a year I'd come back and check on it to see if I lost all the money or made some. I also don't want to buy a car, as I don't want to pay for the insurence. So should I just keep putting my paychecks in my savings account?

62,Rental Car Insider: Avoid Unexpected Surprises!,"Hello PF, long time lurker, first time poster. I thought you all might be interested in some money savings, and hassle savings tips from a Rental Car Sales rep. As a former outsider to this industry, there's so many shady things that on, people just simply aren't aware. aren't paying attention, or are misinformed about the rental car processes, ""hidden"" fees, and qualifications. Here's my top 7 list:

1. All insurance products are \*always\* optional. You do not have to take ""minimum coverage"", nor any coverage for that matter, as long as you verbally accept the terms and conditions of declining said coverage. You can always state that you are using your own insurance, or that you accept full liability of not carrying insurance. 
2. On this same note, some credit cards cover damage to rental vehicles, even if your personal car insurance doesn't. Off the top of my head, AMEX Gold (and above), all Capital One credit cards, and some others cover what they call ""Loss of Use"" as well as any collision/etc.
3. If they don't have the vehicle you reserved and you've made the reservation at least 24 hours prior, they are required to either procure said vehicle within a reasonable amount of time or offer you a \*free\* upgrade. Do not fall prey to the tactic of ""oh we're gonna make you wait 2 hours unless you buy this premium vehicle at $100 extra per day"". 
4. In some states, married couples get to be added as an additional driver for free. In CA, you get one additional driver for free regardless. This does not apply in all states. 
5. With almost every rental company, you're going to want to bring a major credit card instead of a debit card. Debit cards severely limit us, we usually need additional security verifications and it drastically limits your selection of vehicles if we can even accept debit \*at all\*. Don't say the classic line of ""my debit can be run as credit"", they are totally different transaction types, cards, and verification processes. 
6. On this same note don't bother with all-online banks like Chime, Dave, etc. Go with a brick-and-mortar bank that has at least one physical branch location. 
7. Last but not least, \*always\* verify the final price! Shadier sales reps will try and sneak crap into your contract just to make a quick buck off people who aren't paying attention. It's unethical af but it happens.",personalfinance,1637429316

71,Advice on inheritance,"Hi there,

I read the sidebar and was hoping for some specific advice for my financial situation. 

I’m M31 married to F31 with two kids under 1 year old. We both work part-time and stay home part-time because we live in a rural area and there is literally no child care available (we’re on waitlists that are 2 years out).

We’ve saved about 9 months’ worth of emergency funds. We each have retirement matching contributions through our jobs (mine is a IRA and hers is a 401k).

We own our home that’s valued at $400,000 and there’s about $230,000 left on our mortgage with an interest rate of 3.99%.

I have $90,000 in student debt with an interest rate of 6.125%. Our monthly payments are about $380. I work in public service but since I’m not working full-time, it would be a long time before the 10-year PSLF. 

We have about $8,000 on a car loan with interest rate of 7%. Our monthly payments are about $270.

We started contributing to a 529 plan for each of our kids. If we continue at the current rate we felt comfortable with, it will pay for 2 years of higher education tuition for both of them by the time they’re 18. Monthly contributions are about $300. 

We just learned we’ll be inheriting about $100,000. We’ll be talking to a financial advisor but the main question we have is: does it make the most sense to pay off the student debt? Or invest it in something else? We feel like we can manage the monthly payments but will make saving any more than what we currently have pretty difficult given that we’re living off the equivalent of one income.

74,Looking for advice purchasing my first Apartment,"So for context, I live in Colorado. The rent prices here have gotten pretty absurd in the last 8 months unfortunately. I am starting a remote job with a salary of about 70,000, have no debt, and about 25,000 in savings and liquid assets.

I have two places narrowed down. One is closer to My current friends, in a city with better internet, and honestly just feels right in every regard I was I'm looking for. The only con is that with my salary, considering the lease and utilities and internet, I'm sort of breaking the 50 30 20 rule. It's more 55 or so, but I would still be able to save 20.

The second place is further south, has everything I technically need, like good internet, enough room for two desks, access the basic needs. And it's about 500 less a month. It's in an area where I would like to be less likely to make friends, keep in touch with the current friends I have, in the summer there is worse.

This is my first full-time job, though I do have really great credit. I come from a really problematic family, and don't really have any mentors I can talk to about this in person. It will only be for 11 months, before I relocate to the Pacific Northwest to be closer to my job. I know hearing this, it might sound weird to care about my friends here, but being an apartment 24/7 I am concerned about retaining a proper social life for my mental health, that's why the former option has a bit of extra appeal to me.

Coming from a very bad living situation, I don't really know what I should do. My priority is improving my mental health and general happiness, because I'll still easily be able to save 20% of each paycheck I get no matter where I go. The first place would be great for my mental health, but it feels awful to push to 50 30 20 rule so much when I technically have a cheaper alternative that would probably just make me a less happy that would be better financially.

TL;DR - 1700 a/mo place fits my needs perfectly, a 1200 a/mo place is an option that technically fits my needs and would let me save more money. Not sure if I need to save more money, how much the priority of happiness is financially worth, etc...",personalfinance,1637427235

84,Mortgage company mistakenly reversed mortgage payment,"I refinanced my mortgage earlier this year and the new mortgage was sold to PNC Bank. Soon after, I got a copy of my tax bill which says it was requested by PNC. I prepaid property taxes at closing and the title company who handled the closing made the payment of property taxes for this year.

However, PNC also made a duplicate tax payment even though I only had $700 in my escrow account and even though I informed them that the title company already paid it. This created a shortage in my account and I asked them to reverse the payment. 

I discovered a week later they they actually reversed this month’s mortgage. PNC and my bank blamed the other for it even though I made the first payment in October without any problems. 

After going back and forth between PNC and my bank, I finally got a representative with PNC who seemed to understand what was going on. In attempting to reverse the duplicate tax payment, the processing department misinterpreted the situation and reversed my mortgage payment. I have not been charged a late fee but he said they could waive it if I get charged. He said the mortgage payment was sent back yesterday and I should get it back within a few days.

I found out from the tax collector that they didn’t get any payment from PNC but would refund it to PNC if/when they get it.

I wrote a letter to PNC informing them of these errors. Under federal law, they must fix them within 30 days but may extend it an additional 15 days in some situations. What recourse do I have if it’s still not fixed on the 46th day?

SO and I are expecting our first baby. We're very excited about it but the insurance system in the US is slowly sucking the excitement away. Literally every single thing that's needed to monitor the health of the baby has some clause attached to it.

I have Aetna through my employer - the plan says preventive care to monitor the health of the baby and the mother is fully covered at 100%. To any reasonable person, this would seem like things like ultrasounds/blood tests will be covered. NO - have to call them before every doctor visit and check if that week's test is covered.

We got our NIPT test done yesterday. The receptionist at the facility told us that the test would cost us $250 if we paid out of pocket. That's fine, no problems paying that. However our gynecologist says that since we have insurance, we are not allowed to pay out of pocket and have no alternative but to eat the cost. WTF!!

2,Is a condo always a bad deal?,"
Hi all, I would love some advice. I’m interested in getting started in RE investing on my own. I found an area next to a growing state school (formerly a commuter school).  The building itself is on a hill a few blocks from a small downtown college with nice restaurants. And two blocks from a hospital. I like the area. SFHs in the area go for around 500k, which would be ideal but I would need to wait a few years before I could enter. I figure a condo would be a simple easy way to get my feet wet in the area and gain experience too.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Here’s the deal.

1br/1ba condo w/ beautiful view of a huge mountain and over looking the city. It’s a small 2 story apartments building with only 12 units total. A few blocks from a hospital and up hill from a growing state school. Exterior  is dated but the interior is quite nice no amenities. 

200k purchase price -P/I ~$720 (15% down 30k @ ~3.7 still shopping for rates)
1300 rent (rentometer says 1650)
250 HOA covers management fees, sewage, water, trash no electricity
HOA has about 30k in account total
No SAs on the horizon 
 Plan to self manage since it’s about 25 min away.
Property tax is ~1800

I am familiar with the debt snowball method Ramsey teaches, where you pay off smallest loans first. Another way is to pay off highest interest debts first. I have another approach I am thinking about.

What if I figure out which debts I should pay off to give me the highest net cash flow? For instance, I have a student loan about 10k. Interest rate is low, but it takes $250 from me each month.

6,"Roll over 401k to Roth? Very high earning potential, at age 28 2021 will be last year in 22% bracket and last year able to contribute to Roth.","Age 28. I have $34k in a 401k that I need to roll over. 

I have a spouse (age 30), all his retirement funds are in a Roth, and we file jointly. Together we have under $100k in retirement. We were saddled with debt initially and now our careers have skyrocketed.

2021 earnings put us toward the top of the 22% tax bracket. If I roll the $30k from the 401k to a Roth, the additional income would bring us to the 24% tax bracket range for 2021.

Our current salaries changed late this year and will put us solidly in the 24% bracket for 2022 onward. We have a very high earning potential and we may spend a good portion of our working years in the 32% bracket.

Beginning in 2022, we will be unable to contribute to Roth due to max savings cap.

Should I roll over the $30k amount to a Roth? Or keep in a 401k? Tax implications aside, I wonder if it could be advantageous to have a collective &lt;$100k in Roth as an alternative to ""all the rest"" of our future retirement contributions which will be in a 401k or other investment options.

7,"I am looking for a budgeting app like YNAB, but dumbed down and free. Any suggestions?","The thing i loved about ynab was the money bucket system. I liked to manually allocating my paycheck, but the part that made ynab so nice was being able to quickly add and subtract income/expenses into said buckets with their built in calculator. Spending $3 and being able to quick subtract that, or gaining $300 and being able to put that in my available money, then allocate it later; it was very nice. Thats literally all i used it for , though, before realizing it was a trial.

I prefer having just overall budget at the current moment (ex: i currently have $200 of free fun spending money and i happen upon $20 more so i add that on, but two months from now i only have $2 free spending money. Brans doesnt allow me to do this as im stuck to whatever the original budget i set for each month).

I dont mind spending money on an app, just dont think what i am asking for is worth the $84 a year from ynab.

8,When to not feel guilty about spending money?,"Using a throwaway acct. because I'd rather not disclose financial information about myself from my main account.

I'm 28yo and feel like I am in a good spot financially, but have a really hard time feeling comfortable spending money on myself. I grew up in a very lower middle class family, we barely ever went to restaurants, never went on an airplane/vacation, never had the ""newest things"". My childhood was comfortable, and I'm not complaining one bit, I just never really had anything above and beyond what was considered necessities.

I worked through college, and was an RA so I could afford housing, graduated with \~$40k in student debt, and I luckily started my career in healthcare with a job paying \~$75k about 7 years ago. I prioritized paying off student debt, and had it all paid off within 18 months, then built up an emergency fund of \~6 months. My partner and I moved into a decent apartment together where we lived for 3 years while saving up for a home. She also paid off all of her student debt in that time.

2 years ago we purchased a home, $500k brand new construction and in a town we love with 5% down. I make \~$120,000 per year, my partner makes \~$90,000. Our monthly mortgage with interest/insurance/principal is $2,700 which is completely affordable (we split this 50/50). We owe \~$470,000 on the mortgage 30yr at 2.65%, the house is currently valued at $640,000. We have no other debt in our names. I own three cars (an older truck, a Honda I use to commute, and an older sports car for the weekends), everything is paid off, no loans.

My current accounts are:

401K - $85,000 invested primarily in VTI

Roth - $18,500 invested primarily in VTI

iBonds - $10,000

HSA - $3,500

Savings Acct. - $66,000

Checking Acct. - $15,000

I am currently maxing my 401K, Roth, HSA, and contributing $10,000 per year to iBonds. This leaves me with roughly $1,200 extra on average each month that tends to just build up in my savings account after all expenses.

Using the prime directive on this subreddit leaves me with no direction. I know I'm in a good spot, but the thought of just moving along like this for the next 20 years or so just doesn't feel...exciting? Am I ok to spend $1,000 a month on fun things? Maybe going out more, weekend trips, etc? We used to go on a big vacation the past few years before COVID, but haven't in the past two years.

I've bought nice things in the past, more expensive cars requiring an auto loan, expensive gaming computers, etc. The trouble I have is, when things appreciate in value, like the situation of a car becoming worth *more* because I either got a great deal on it, or the market flips, I can't pass up the opportunity to put profits before my personal enjoyment. I struggle with this a lot. I'm a car enthusiast, but I hate the idea of owning something terribly expensive. I like technology but I only buy phones that are 2-3 years old. I enjoy pc gaming, but I have an old computer that I use GeForce Now on (a monthly streaming service), since it makes more financial sense than spending money on a graphics card right now, especially since I only tend to play video games in the winter. I enjoy biking a lot, but I buy used bikes on craigslist and fix them up. How do I get comfortable with this?

Final point, I'd like to semi-retire in my early 50's (or sooner), I'd like to have the freedom to switch careers to more of a hobby career with either no income, or low income. I plan to have the house paid off by then (25years from now or sooner), at that point I expect my monthly expenses to be around $2,000 in today's dollars. I'm using a ladder method of buying iBonds annually to help with this and tide me over until traditional retirement if possible. My calculations of just 5% returns (average) make this seem possible.

31,Is it good idea to save money via long-term in ETF stocks?,"Hi folks!

I am 23 years old, living in Kyiv, Ukraine. Working in software for about 5 years now.

I have money that I don't use. Also I would like to save up some amount of my salary and put it into good use.

There is no 401k plan in my country and no such stuff as retirement accounts. Banks in Ukraine are unreliable and I am anxious to keep my retirement on deposit. Also, I don't want to store money in cash in my flat and I don't want to buy apartment or car. 

Recently I discovered Interactive Brokers, which is SIPC ensured. I am thinking about putting my unused money into Vanguard ETF + buy more on monthly basis (say, 30% of my salary). This ETF money ideally would be for retirement or costly emergency.

What do you think about it? I have few concerns like:

1. I need to figure out paper work for taxes in Ukraine
2. I am not really into finances and stocks. My plan is once in a month login into IB, buy ETFs, close IB. This seems a bit silly to me, because it looks very simple, and stock market seemed very hard to me.
3. Situation in Ukraine is unstable and USA or IB might close co-operation with Ukraine for some reason and I will need a way to get my stocks through another broker. It might be difficult.

Thanks in advance and have a good day!",personalfinance,1637405009

35,Credit Building Advice for a 29 year old gaming nerd.,"I'm a video game junkie that wants to increase his stats in real life. I currently have a place comped by my work, but I have little credit history, and it's not great. I'm thinking about getting my own apartment in the future, as I'm getting promoted and will have the funds to do so comfortably by Fall of 2022.

Some extra info:

I do have one outstanding collection from a phone carrier that wouldn't cancel/pause my plan while I was out on a Naval deployment. I'm currently working on fighting this one.

I have never had a car, and have never learned how to drive. That's due to being homeless prior to the military, then having reliable public transportation there after.

My phone is currently a boost mobile plan, and I haven't seen any increases after having it for 2 years. Would switching to a contract carrier add to my mix at all?

I'm also currently looking into a secured card and weighing my options there. When it comes to credit cards, would buying a video game and paying it off every month be enough?

37,How soon is too soon to refinance an auto loan?,"I bought a 21 Mazda two months ago (I chose new because used car prices are ridiculous and I was looking for an everyday commute car that'll last 10+ years). I originally wanted to make a loan through my credit union, but I wanted to try for Mazda's 0% financing that I didn't end up getting. Their offer was about the same as the one my CU offered, so I went with it.

I've encountered problems with the loan every step of the way. They outsourced my loan to a different CU and put all of the wrong information on file, and it took about a month before I was able to figure out where the loan was and get all of that corrected and make a payment. Even then, they still had my information wrong and I couldn't access my account or any payment options, which only got corrected this week. I'm on the website and the app and it's awkward to navigate, it's not letting me make a payment or view due dates. There's other issues too, and I'm getting frustrated.

Considering I already have a savings in place that was meant to cover my loan costs, I want to refinance with my CU and start paying it off ASAP. My credit score took a slight hit from the loan, is it too soon to refinance or should I wait a few months for my score to recover? Does it even matter?",personalfinance,1637400586

47,"Should I have 401k, Roth IRA, and a Stock Market Brokerage Account?","Hello, I'm fairly new to investing but I have done a bit of research understanding a 401k, IRA and Roth IRA. I currently have a 401k with my employer and I have recently opened a stock brokerage account with Fidelity. However, I'm not really all that interested in the process of buying and selling stocks every day and would prefer to just do something where I can put my money in an account and forget about it until the day I retire.

My understanding is a Roth IRA is better for long-term investing, where you will be able to get the money once you retire at the appropriate age. Likewise, 401k is also similar to Roth IRA but it also usually has the company match as well.

I plan on contributing to my 401k and Roth IRA, and then I want to use my Brokerage account to buy stocks from companies that will grow overtime. Should I focus on all 3 and put in little bits of my paycheck for each account?

49,$30k in CC Debt. Options?,"I’ve never posted here before, please let me know if I need to edit this/if it’s giving too much of my personal info out. 

The past two years have been pretty rough financially and I’ve been living in denial about it. I was furloughed for over a year, spent like I wasn’t to cover up my sadness, and had some cash sucks like moving, a non-refundable deposit on a venue, and repairing our car. My debt doubled. I had always carried some debt with these cards because I was young and still giving to my 401k, what’s the big deal, right? Wrong. 

Anyways, here’s a break down of the cards in order of account opening: 
1) Retail store visa, balance $12k, limit $15k, APR 26%
2) MasterCard, balance $9k, limit $10k, APR 20% 
3) hotel Amex, balance $9k, limit $10, APR 29% 

Ideally, I want to decimate the debt amount (duh), ditch the retail card all together, swap the MasterCard for a visa with lower APR/cash back to keep as an emergency card, and keep the hotel Amex for my (work related) travel expenses. 

What I have working for me: 
-One full time job where I am able to pick up extra shifts and earn more by advertising my company’s credit card (the irony isn’t lost on me). Pay varies by month but I imagine I should be around $50k+ not including the card hawking. 
-$18k in a 529 with no prospects of going back to school 
-$22k in a 401k (contributing 7%, company matching that 7% at 100%) 
-somewhere over $100k in INH IRAs 
-$4.5k in emergency savings/eventual down payment savings 
-no car payment, no student loans, about $2k a month in living expenses split with my hub 

I feel like when I list this out this way I get too complicit with my debt. What would be the best way to nab my debt with what I have? 

I get a guaranteed raise each year, so part of me thinks using the value of the 529 now would be a good idea since if I take it out later I may be taxed more on withdrawals. I know I shouldn’t touch the 401k. I don’t know if taking from the INH IRA is a good or bad idea. I don’t want to take from our emergency fund because the last time we had an emergency it was around the same amount. I’m open to looking into a loan. I’m not great with understanding exactly what I’m looking at with finances, so I am open to suggestions.

I'm making around $95000 a year, my rent is around $1500 and other bills come around $500.

A reason why a lease makes sense to me: I'm looking for a lower monthly payment, and I most likely won't be driving 10000 miles in a year. Plus I'm planning to get something newer in three years

Why a used car makes more sense: Same as above, but maybe paying a bit more each month but I'll be investing it into something when I purchase or buy used again.

-	based on the last month rule, I am qualified to contribute full 2021 amount of $3600, and my employer will only contribute 2/12 months, which is 750 *2 /12= $125 total for these three paychecks. Which means I can contribute the rest (3475) all at once from my paycheck? (Paycheck is roughly $7000 pretax)
-	if so, I will need to ask the payroll to set the deduction amount for, and only for, my next paycheck. 
-	I could make it simpler by just contribute from my bank account (after tax), and I can get the fed and state tax refunded next year, BUT NOT FICA, which is roughly 8%. So basically I will loss 8% of $3475. Is this right? (Don’t care about the employer part)
-	for next year’s contribution, I want to max it as soon as possible (have some medical expenses planned). Since employer will contribute $750 total over the 26 paychecks, I can actually ask payroll to deduct 3600-750=2850 in the first paycheck of 2022, and wait for the employer contribution to finish the rest. Is this right?
-	in case I mis-calculate it, and accidentally contribute over the limit (probably by not much, maybe $20), I will have to pay tax on those, since it’s not much to begin with, should I worry? Would it be less hassle by intentionally contribute slightly less to avoid?
-	in terms of investing, if the money is invested in mutual funds in HSA account, and I need to pay bills, do they automatically sell the fund for exactly the amount I charge? Or I have to do it manually sell it prior to using the HSA debit card?

The community college I went to in Tennessee has something called the Tennessee Promise, where you can go to community college 2 years for free. 
I took maaaaad advantage of that. 


TN also has something called the HOPE scholarship (I’m pretty sure your state has something similar) where it granted you $3,500 a year. 
I also applied for random scholarships and got another one for $500 a semester. It was completely random, no idea what it was even for. 
Keep in mind I haven’t even got to the federal grants. 
I was granted $4,000 a year, probably because I live with a single parent. Colleges will give you a “refund check” if you have money left over after tuition. And boy boy boy. After those 2 years I had like $8,000 cash in my bank account. The next year and a half (didn’t graduate on time) I did have to pay but tuition was like $1500 a semester while I’m bringing in $4,000 a semester. 


I graduated with an associates degree and $14K in cash lmao. What a hack. Please go to community college. This extra money went straight into the stock market while I have a full time job at 21 years old.

I come from banking so admittedly it’s quite high, but I don’t know what startup salaries are like. 

They don’t have any benefits or bonuses, just salary. They said they had to check with the ceo about my base salary, but didn’t seem shocked by the figure. of course I want more if I’m not getting bonus/benefits. 

* How do I negotiate this during the second round? 
* Are startup salaries generally lower? 
* Will they lowball me now that I’ve given a figure or since they don’t know the worth of my full package the ball is still in my court? 

Any advice much appreciated!",personalfinance,1637383439

77,Father recently passed away leaving my Mom to try to figure out finances. So many questions...,"Hello all,

My dad recently passed away very unexpectedly.  It seems that my mom was basically an ""authorized card user"" on several accounts.  One of these cards is a BofA account which currently has a $200 balance.  She tried to use this card to pay for the funeral expenses, and it was declined, which led us to the realization that she is only an authorized card user, not a joint account holder.  The discussion on the phone with the person from BofA indicated that she is not responsible for the balance, but his estate will be.

What does this mean, exactly?  I think I understand the ""estate"" if it was just my dad, or if dad/mom were both to pass, but is there still an ""estate"" when there is a surviving spouse?   They did have a will drawn up a while back (I need to see if I have a copy).

Lastly, there was another account that they had with Home Depot for some kitchen remodeling that they had done within the last year.  That one had a much larger balance (around $10k).  My mom called them earlier today to inquire about how to make the payments, and they informed her that the account would be closed, and that she was not resposible for it.  Once again, the account must have only been in my dad's name.  It seems baffling that they would tell her this, but she said they told her that this happens every day.  In reality, would this balance be similar to the one for the credit card, and the estate will become responsible for it?  I can't see HD just writing off $10k in a situation like this...

Thank you for any guidance you may have for me here.",personalfinance,1637382698

80,Should I be paying for these car repairs?,"Context: I brought in my car to get normal maintenance done. Oil, coolant, spark plugs, transmission fluids and all air filters. All were done routinely except for the coolant where the car was, I should say, a bit harder to work on than they expected. Car stayed in longer than expected. 

Fast forward a few days, after trying to figure out what seems to be the problem w the engine cooling system, car was test driven and was told that it’s all good. It was not. This was where the real problem started. 

After that initial test drive, the car was test driven again. This was when the car’s engine kind of blew up. Kind of because initially the test driver (owner of shop) thought the engine grenaded itself, rendering it useless. Smoke out back, oil seeped out and puddled. Car was towed back to shop and was not looked at until 2-3days later. It was later found out that the engine is intact* and twas the vacuum pump that gave out. Now this pump is in the process of being replaced. 

My question is, from the time that car “blew up,” should I be held liable in paying for all labors and parts or not since this happened during the test drive after the coolant system issue was fixed. 

Mind you I am willing to pay, but definitely dint want them to think I’m a pushover. I am not getting out of any financial responsibility but rather wanted to know what is fair in this situation. It is a specialized car and tbh, it was completely fine and running (drove it about 850mi a week) prior to this maintenance service being done.

99,Negotiating pay raise,"Hi, I know this question has been asked many times before, but I wanted some feedback on my particular situation.

I work for an engineering company. This year, me (female) and coworker (let's call him Phil) got promoted. We came into the company, fresh out of college, at the same time. Both with the same engineering degree but from different colleges. Same age. We came in with the same pay. We then both got the same exact pay raise during our company's annual pay raise.

Here's the thing: due to our company's current situation, promotions were not handed out all at once. So I got promoted 6 months earlier than him. When he got promoted, he told me his salary: he is now making $10k more than me. My manager told me it was not possible making past $80k as a Level A engineer back when I got my promotion, but my coworker received $90k. It felt like a slap to the face; almost like I got punished for being promoted earlier. So basically, we got promoted in the same year to the same level with the same experience, but he got $10k more than me.

I do not feel this is fair. I've interned at the company a few times in college while he only interned once--this counts as seniority so that means I have more time in the company than him. Our company hands out retention ratings. I got a higher retention rating than Phil, and Phil almost got laid off last year. During layoffs, my manager said she would do everything she can to keep me because she valued me. 

I do more projects, have mentored interns (which manager knows about), and about to take over as lead of an important project with high visibility (a role my manager put me in, but not Phil). I am versatile and a fast learner, and my manager has pointed that out before. I've received max score on annual reviews (which is difficult at my company) and glowing comments from my manager and coworkers about my work. I feel like I am almost more qualified at my job than Phil, but have gotten screwed over by the promotion pay. I am being paid lower than the average engineer in my position in my city, and am now the lowest paid engineer on my team (everyone on my team has seniority and me and Phil are the youngest engineers).

How do I bring this up with my manager? Of course, I do not want to use Phil as a reason, but I feel like I won't be able to make my case without telling my manager that I know someone at my level received higher pay. I believe that my achievements speak for themselves, but I've never negotiated salary and I don't know how to approach this particular situation.

My dad passed away last April (2021). His life insurance policy paid him out $140,000. My mom was the beneficiary. My mom gave me $70,000, as a gift. I put $40,000 into the citibank savings account. I then added $8,000 from my personal checking with TCF. Then I added $5,000 from the same account. Well, when I added the $5,000 from TCF, that was the week they changed over to Huntington bank. So account numbers changed. The deposit was denied. Okay fine, no biggie. A few weeks later, they send me a letter in the mail saying that my account is being closed to due fraudulent activity with the mention of the $5,000 deposit that was denied. That was the only thing mentioned. My account has been blocked for about 10 days and I have no access to that money.

I have spent hours and hours on hold with citi bank, and transferred around with different people because nobody has any idea what they are talking about. They are literally reading from a script. Nobody could tell me why my account was flagged for ""fraudulent activity"".

I finally got to talk to someone today who gave me some information. He didn't tell me the reason it was being flagged, but he did tell me this.

THIS IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY.

My money has been transferred to the federal government because it has been determined by the fraud department at Citibank that the money *is not mine.* My money isn't even with citibank anymore, it is with the federal government.

Nobody has contacted me to get more information, or proof that it is my money. Nobody has investigated. They just decided ""ope, that's not her money"". And gave it to the mother f\*cking government.

17,Scam or identity theft? Received a payslip and a payroll check from a former employer,"As the title states, I received a payslip and a payroll check from a former employer (a bank) via snail mail. Considering I last worked for this bank 4 years ago, this was unexpected. I was a standard W2 employee and this is a company I had given my 2 weeks notice. Pretty much a cookie-cutter separation ""I found another job so here's my 2 weeks notice"".

The payslip looks like the ones I used to get when I was working there, and the payroll check itself seems legitimate as it has all of the usual security features (heat-sensitive ink, microprint, watermarks, etc.). The pay type only states ""Pay adjustment"" and shows I have a few hours remaining for ""sick time"". 

I've messaged my old company via their online banking portal as I'm thinking this is an error, but it's an odd one considering I've been off their payroll for 4 years - I find it unlikely that I would suddenly go back on their payroll for some random ""pay adjustment"" 4 years later.

One company took me into consideration and wiped the bill clean. The other… is stubborn. The company itself is super difficult to reach, and mail from them takes 2+ weeks. I have a $600 bill from them that I cannot afford. I have tried proving my need of financial assistance, but I’m pretty sure they shot me down. My questions here: 

1. If if I HAVE to pay this (and I really can’t) it says online I can pay a minimum of $5. Will this prevent me from being sent to collections?

**Goal:**

Max out Net Profits of my LLC

**Company Type:**

\&gt; LLC partners (Wife and I, 50%-50%. Ratio can be changed as needed)

\&gt; Employees= 0, Wife nor I do not take any Paychecks.

**Spouse Details:**

\&gt; She works for the business LLC. No outside income for her

\&gt; Puts $6k in IRA (Max Limit)

**Myself:**

\&gt; I am non working partner in the LLC. I do not take any W2 from the LLC

\&gt; I have outside W-2

\&gt; I max out my 401k from my Day Job Employer for $19.5k limit

Questions:

1&gt; What is the best to divert the profits for LLC. We do not care if its under my name or my spouse. What ever we can max out in pretaxes

2&gt; Confused solo 401k or SEP or SIMPLE IRA

3&gt; IF I do SOLO 401k, we do not take W2 income. Hence can my Wife put in 19k/year after Dec 31st?

4&gt; Also can wife &amp; I both do EMPLOYER contribution of 20% or 25% ?? (which is PROFIT= $50k/ea x 20%= $10k each) EVEN if we do not take W2?

5&gt; My ABC LLC is in WY which has subsidiary XYZ LLC in TX (100% owned by ABC). All action/business/profits occurs in XYZ LLC but it gets passed to ABC LLC and then to Personal Tax Returns. So under what company LLC do I open the retirement accounts?

37,Roth or Brokerage,"Hello, I am fairly well versed in IRA/Roth/401k,Roth 401k, 457s, and similar, so this isn't an investment question per say, more just math...

What I'm stuck on is some basic math apparently.

If you had $100, to put in *either* a Roth with limited investment options, or the same $100 to put in *anything*, and assuming a 15% long term gains tax, what percentage would you need to beat the Roth by, to come out ahead?

So, if the Roth gets you a 10% ROI, you'd have to get XX% on your own, to break even? 

After some time with excel, I came up with 11.77%

So, if I put my cash into investments on my own, without any tax advantage, I'd only need to beat the Roth's ROI by 1.77% to break even?

Seems like the Roth should provide a much larger advantage than that...?

Looks like a 401k is taxed as normal income, so the Roth beats that, assuming higher taxes at retirement. 

But, does a Roth beat on your own investing...? that's 15% long term gains for me, but I understand that could change (and not because I'd hit the next bracket). 

These figures are round and easy, my investments are beating a 10% ROI, no worries. :)

About 25 years ago, I was diagnosed with an eye disease. Since then, I've lost one eye and the other is currently dealing with an internal bleed which is making next to impossible to see. Almost 2 years ago, I bought a used single wide mobile home before my eyes are the way they are now. About 2 months ago, I bought a car because my one good eye hssad improved enough to ler me drive again. This past Tuesday, good eye developed a bleed and can no longer legally drive until bleed clears. Last time this happened, I quit driving for about 10 months and sold my last car.

The shitty thing about this eye disease is, I never know when something will happen nor how bad. Now, I feel like I need to ditch my house and live in an apartment to reduce responsibilty load and, I feel the same way about my car, too. I can't have it sitting around for a year hoping I'll get to use it again one day. I feel like I jumped the gun on getting the car, but the ride situation at my job was coming to an end and my boss wasn't making any effort to move me to first shift where I could use rides other than Uber. Ubrt od too expensive to use full. It would cost me 160 nucks just to go to work and back 4 days a week.

47,Is it a poor idea to take out a small loan at say 5% apr to buy additional stocks?,"&amp;#x200B;

 So, my finances are a slight mess but not in a bad way? I owe about 3k in credit card debt. I make about 50K a year on my job but profited on the stock market about 29k last year, turning 25k invested into 54k. I think i am good at investing and mitigating risk with a combination of reliable companies and a healthy amount of higher return investing.

I recently did a discover balance transfer for a 0% transfer and a 5% apr. I moved all of my credit cards here so I can use my spare dollars and overtime to pay down that debt which I am confident I can do by Feb or maybe March.

I'm considering since the APR is only 5%, would it be a poor idea to take an extra 3k  from the transfer and use that to boost my portfolio from 54k to 57k invested? Its not like I don't have the capitol to pay it down in a year if I want to. The markets are growing at crazy rates that a 5% apr seems like a drop in the bucket. I am relatively confident that even conservatively invested in an index stock that 3k would be 4k in 12 months. Given the nature of the loan I think I would put the money into a safer index. Perhaps even a super safe one like VOO.

It exposes myself to a small amount of risk, but I have some long positions that I can sell in June or July to pay back the 6k loan with relative ease. I guess I am trying to decide if this is a reasonable risk to take given the low interest rate on the balance transfer.

I’m a little over 3 years into my loan and have a little less than 2 years left of payments. 

I work mostly from home now so I don’t put very many miles on my Jeep anymore, and I know Jeeps tend to depreciate slower than most vehicles. The vehicle I’m looking to buy costs about $38k. However, this leads me to my question. 

Would it financially make more sense for me to go ahead and trade my Jeep in and use my $10k in equity on a new auto loan? Or would it make more sense to pay off my remaining balance over the next two years on my loan of $14k, then go buy a “new” vehicle?

No more reach outs for the rest of the trip from him, I know nothing is being done so i get back and go in and ask to reverse the transaction. Now the current value of the foreign money is \~70$ less. I tell him this is why I emailed and called many times because I knew the market would fluctuate and its dumb that I have to come in to reverse the transaction when they literally still have the money and its not like I had to sign anything when I went back in which is why I asked to do it over the phone.

I couldnt even call another branch that does pick up to be like hey, can you reverse the transaction cuz they dont have the foreign currency in their possession. 

Can I escalate this? Call this employee out? Any other recommendations?",personalfinance,1637369670
53,How to help my father recover from bad credit,"Hi All,

My father is quite in a bad situation. His credit is EXTREMELY low (500s). My father always had over an 800 credit score before this. However my mother controls the bills. My father works 60 hours a week (plumber) cooks and does side work to provide for our family. Unfortunately my mother is bipolar, and has some drug usage/alcohol problems. She runs a small business, but barely works and ALOT of our finances come from my father. The main problem is that my mom loves to screw over my father whenever possible. The most innovative way she did it was by screwing up his credit. Everything is in his name. House, electric bill, phone bills, etc. She pays things late, rack up credit cards ,things go into debt collection (I tell my dad not to pay debt collectors because it will hurt your credit score) and it affects my father and our family.

I had a long conversation about credit tonight. I told my father he should get a divorce legally and start building up credit for himself. He claims he has an old buisness credit card from chase. I did some research and found that Chase buisness credit cards do not positively affect your credit score, they only will do negative damage if you are delinquent.

Long story short how do I get my father in a state to start building his credit back up to the 700 range to start. Any ideas how to convince him credit is important and he should work on it? He keeps using the excuse that his car is paid off and doesn't need a new one and isn't moving. My father is responsible when it comes to using his OWN credit card, but it's mainly when my mother controls the main finances it gets messy.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing some ideas.",personalfinance,1637369670

57,Next steps on reporting capital one?,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub. Capital One is holding $5k hostage from me and I’d like advice on next steps, apart from the obvious of getting a new bank. 

Backstory:
I have a bank account with capital one. It’s my daily driver and not just somewhere I put my savings. I opened the account when I was a minor. As such, I needed Family Member (“FM”) to be named on the account.

I’m not a minor anymore. I have tried taking FM off of my account years ago, but I would have needed to close my account and open a new one. I chose not to because this account is tied to my oldest line of credit and I needed to build my credit history. I have never had a problem with FM using my account. I am not worried about FM stealing my money. FM does not use my account, has never used my account, and will never use my account. Every penny that I has ever been deposited or withdrawn has been solely mine. 

Today I noticed that a $5k hold was put on my account. I called Capital One to inquire. I was transferred, put on hold, etc for an hour before they told me that they couldn’t tell me why there was a hold on my account. They said they could only talk to FM about why there is a hold. On my account. 

FM calls Capital One at my request. I was not on that phone call as we live in different cities, but according to FM, this is the gist:

-over 10 years ago someone opened up a capital one account in FMs name. There was less than $5k in that account. 
-FM did not open the account but the account had all their info: SSN, current address, etc. 
-FM tried to confirm if the money in the account was actually hers … I don’t remember the details here… FM withdraws the money I think. I really don’t have any other info on this
-apparently Capital One admitted that they had no idea how the account was opened but they’re working on it
-fast forward to today, now Capital One has a hold on my account for more than the amount that was in that mysterious savings account and they won’t talk to me about what is happening with MY money. 

What should my next steps be? What recourse do I have in getting my $5k back?

Also what checking accounts do you recommend elsewhere?",personalfinance,1637368539
58,Old Job keeps asking for sign on bonus back,"I recently changed jobs 6 months ago and I left the company after 1.6 years just about, my contract said that I would have to pay back the sign on bonus if I left before two years.

Several days before my last day at work my manager called me to inform me that I did not have pay back the sign on bonus. I took that for face value and never though about it again (I do not have any written proof of this currently), until I have received a letter in the mail a month after leaving saying I had to payback the sign on bonus. I told them What I said above about my manager and they left me alone for 6 months and just now resent another letter asking for the bonus again (they said they would look into it after I told them initially).

59,Paying off student loan with life insurance,"My husband passed away this year and I received the low end of six figures in life insurance. I have two children who receive survivor benefits that cover our basic living expenses. I was a stay at home mom at the time of his death. I'm in the process of getting licensed in my field of study but have had to postpone the process while I get through the grief so I am currently unemployed.

Should I use the life insurance to pay off my student loans or should I defer them until I have a job and then pay for them that way? Currently I have the life insurance in a savings account because I'm too scared to do anything with it because my instincts aren't reliable.

Normally I'd ask my husband for his advice but his ashes aren't saying much. (j/k - surviving through humor)

COULD IT BE SOMEONE THAT MUST HAVE OPENED A BUSINESS ACCOUNT WITHOUT ME KNOWING?

I have a checking savings account with WF, but never a business account.

How is someone able to create a business account without me not knowing? Is there any ways to check if there's any other accounts opened under my name? I googled the number, but I don't see it listed on Wells Fargo?

If it's possibly a scam, how come I got sent a check? If it may be fraud or a scam, what is the purpose of the check for? Anyone ever experienced something like this or similar before?

No clue how to insert a link to it from here, so hopefully the bot (is there a bot in this subreddit?) has it if anyone needs.

Two more questions:

Your opinion on Motley Fool? They turned $1,000 invested into HD into $45,000 today way back when they put free info on the website. I had stayed with my mom's broker (Baird) b/c I knew I wasn't ready to really learn about investing -- 20 years ago -- and had them place the HD order. Twice I told Baird I wanted to pull a couple thousand out of something else to get more HD. I bought $28, first time (when HD went to $82) I told them what I wanted they STRONGLY AND IMMEDIATELY discouraged it and told me just to stick with their conservative portfolio. I figured they knew better than me. then it went up to $120 and I felt confident it would climb, which it did to 408 today. Of course, the 2nd time I didn't insist like I should have either, so it's my fault and I accept that. But I'm dumping Baird. I'm thinking Motley Fool b/c good for beginners, but reviews are all over the place.

Next Q: with your help, I've decided it's fine to withdraw the $30,000 to pay off credit cards.

But where should I pull it out of? a Roth IRA so there's no taxes, a regular IRA which I guess I can w/o penalty since I'm older than 65 but then I'll have taxes on that, or a non-IRA account? I have a couple of duds that never did do great and even now still aren't, held them for at least 10 years. Combined, they would be about $24,000, so I'd need to get another $6000 from one of the other accounts. however, about 1/2 of the duds are either a Roth or a regular IRA.

Here's the Reader's Digest version:

Need $30,000 to pay off high interest credit card debt. I have about $580,000 invested in mutuals and stocks total, most earning 12-28%. No other significant debt except for mortgage (owe about $112, house is currently worth around $300,000) Y'all decided it would be good to pull it out and get rid of those high-interest cards.

Only income 2021 is a little unemployment w/taxes already deducted, and I just started renting rooms and get $1500 month for that --covers the mortgage, tax, insurance and utilities. so is it better to:

**\*take $$ out of a regular IRA?** I'd have to pay taxes on it, but I'll be in a very low tax bracket and have already paid my unemployment income taxes, so this might be a good year to do that?

**\*take $$ out of a ROTH?** There'd be no taxes then, but I love my ROTHS. All are doing GREAT except one.

\***take $$ out of a non-retirement fund? Taxes on that but it leaves the retirement moneys untouched.**

The hope is by paying off all credit card debt my score will quickly get into the excellent category and i can either re-fi (if they'll let me) at lower interest and pull out extra $$30,000 to repay any retirement funds I've 'borrowed' from. But I want to be realistic, and I know I may not be able to get this to work within 90 days. advice?

66,"I'm a young adult attempting to bring my other friends together at a new apartment, and I'd greatly appreciate some help regarding leasing information thank you so much!","context: I and my girlfriend are 23 years old. We moved from the east to the west coast almost a year ago. we're both from very nice middleclass families who have been helping us with things as they can, so neither of us are entirely financially dependent at this time, though we both work low paying jobs to cover rent and other standard things. We've dealt with leases on our own twice now in and out of school, but there's a new complication. 

.

problem: My girlfriend and i are both mutually very close with another guy, our friend from school, and we all want to find a 3 bedroom together on the west coast at the end of our current lease in February. problems arrive because he is from a poorer family who aren't as accommodating as ours are. i don't want to get into specifics but we've had problems from them before, especially from the father, which in large part i fear is why our friend wants to move across the country in the first place. our friend's family are looking for a new place to live, and i presume because their credit is terrible they've asked him to cosign their lease knowing fully that he plans on moving. 

this causes many problems. firstly (obviously) we fear this puts him in a position where they could legally strongarm him to send money home while we're barely making rent ourselves, putting all 3 of us in a financially difficult situation.  the second issue is that, because of their terrible credit, its we think it's very possible that his name on their lease could make or break their approval. He's stated already that if his family doesn't have a place to live by the end of the year, he's going to be unable to move in time with our lease, as he'll have to remain there and support them financially. 

.

end thing and question: both i and my girlfriend both really want to see this guy again. we have west coast friends but he's a member of the OG college crew, and like us he wants to pursue a career out here. the question I'm positing is basically what are the pitfalls of signing a lease for his parents in his position? what could they do to him using the lease that would force his hand and endanger all 3 of us?

. 

general advice would also be much appreciated, though for the record we're been very clear with him that signing the lease is a terrible idea. thank you in advance!",personalfinance,1637366327

I put in ~$100k into Robinhood that's up 80% as of now.

Have about $140k in CDs, $50k in BoA to get the second tier (not sure if that's worth having it parked there) and probably another $15k scattered across accounts for liquidity.

I recently found a very nice apartment which is everything I'm looking for, but it's $1300 per month. The water/sewage/trash/internet package is an additional $120, and electricity is \~$70. I've made a ""what-if"" budget and if my calculations are accurate I would have $1000 a month, after all of my necessary expenses. 

Most people say to pay 30% of your salary on rent. But this would be a little over 40%.

85,Retroactive Change of Company's Extended Illness Bank Policy,"So the company I work for has two different paid time off policies. The primary one is just normal PTO, which we get X weeks per year (based on tenure), earned proportionately per paycheck, with a maximum accrual limit (use it or lose it), and it can be utilized for either vacation or sick time. Pretty straightforward.

The other policy we have is called EIB, or Extended Illness Bank. We only earn about 1-hour per paycheck (24 hours per year), regardless of tenure. It is basically designed as a company provided short-term disability. The time we've earned can only be used if we are out for an extended period of time for injury or illness (over 5 business days), have a doctors note confirming we can't work, and have exhausted all of our banked PTO time. It's not a huge benefit, and it has only been used a handful of times in company history, but if you've been there for a while it can provide a nice cushion for short term issues. For example, after 10 years of employment, you've basically earned 30-days of EIB, which pays out at full salary. As it can only be used for a major health issues, the vast majority of people have never used it and have built up quite a balance. And since it was such a long accrual process, there was never any cap or maximum set like regular PTO.

Long story short, it was just announced out of nowhere that they've decided to change this policy and limit the maximum EIB accrual to no more than 8 days, and apparently will be retroactively applying it, wiping out any accrued time already earned exceeding this. So people who had saved up weeks/months of EIB are now only going to get 8 days, and no more after that. Someone who has been there ~2.5 years will have the same balance as someone with 25 years of tenure, the latter of which just lost 60+ days they previously had.

To me, this is pretty messed up and unethical to say the least. We've earned that time. If they want to change it going forward, fine, but existing banked time should be grandfathered in IMHO. I couldn't find any firm information on the legality of such a change, as most of what I found is specific to PTO, not this already restrictive EIB type plan. I also live/work in Florida, which is very pro-business, so I don't think we have any state laws governing or regulating whether this type of change can be made as I believe it basically comes down to what is in the handbook, and ours doesn't say much of anything regarding changes like this. 

I've already reached out to HR to make an objection and recommended they grandfather people in -- if people already have 8+ days, they simply won't earn more but won't lose what they already earned. But I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how best to proceed or the legality of such a retroactive change. Is there anything we can do outside of complain and argue against it, or are we pretty much just SOL if they decide to follow through on it?

I never took out a loan to pay for my car, so why a lien was placed on it is unknown. The dealership said it was because I brought in the check a few days after they held the car for me. 

I've been trying for a month to get the title in my hands, but thus far have had zero luck. PNC bank has told me one thing and the dealership tells me the exact opposite. The most recent news I heard from PNC bank is that they mailed me the title a month ago, but couldn't tell me where they sent it to (I recently moved, so not knowing is a big deal. I have yet to see it and my former building hasn't either). The dealership, on the other hand, just told me that I am unable to be mailed the title and instead I'll have to bring a lien release letter to the DMV.  I'm becoming incredibly frustrated by this process and am also losing hundreds of dollars on insurance for a car I'm not even driving.

0,Finding Out How Old A Debt Is When Collection Company Bought Debt Without Any Paperwork,"The details around this are somewhat convoluted but I'm hoping the answer is somewhat straightforward.

My husband and I are co-executors of his cousin's estate.  His cousin died of COVID-19 last year.  His estate was small and straight forward, he had a state pension, he was not married at the time of his death, he had recently sold his house with the intention of moving before he got sick, owned his car outright, and had a moderate amount of credit card debt with one item in collections.   He was not married and his son passed in 2006, while serving in Iraq.

We have gone through the process of notifying creditors and tying up loose ends.  There's only one item that remains that has been annoying and illusive: the item in collections.   The debt took place in WA state but my husband's cousin later moved to CA, where attempts to take him court about it took place.

My husband's cousin was a co-signer on a credit card for a friend around 2013-2014.   He co-signed on the card to help the friend through a difficult financial problem.  The cousin and the friend had an explosive falling out 2 or 3 years later and weren't in contact at the time of his death.   The friend stopped paying on the card somewhere between 2015 and 2016, so it went into collections.   

In terms of locations because statutes of limitation apply, both people on this card were in WA state when the card was opened and the cousin moved to and died in CA in the intervening years.  We don't know where the friend is, we assume WA based on his Facebook profile but he is inactive on Facebook for the most part and/or not responsive to our attempts to reach him, so we really don't know.  

In 2018, the debt was charged off by the bank that issued the cards, US Bank, and purchased on a debt sheet by a collections agency.  The collections agency was unable to track down the primary cardholder (the friend) but served the cousin with paperwork to take them to court about the debt in 2019.   He had not heard from US Bank or the collections agency based on his emails to his attorney at the time until he was served with court paperwork, so based on his records - he had no idea what was going until that moment.   

He had an attorney respond to the summons to the courts, which kicked the responsibility to move this forward through the courts to debt collection attorneys.  They never responded or followed up and the court eventually dismissed the entire thing for lack of action.  

We believe it never moved forward because the collection agency has very little information about debt other than what they have about it on the debt sheet they purchased.   Research about this collection agency in specific is that their tactics are to file notices with the court about an intent to sue to collect to scare the debtholders into paying to avoid a lawsuit by trying to lure them into contacting them about the debt.  This then triggers an acknowledgment which can reset the timeline by which collections on this are time-barred, whether or not they can otherwise legitimize this debt.   They seem to generally expect that people won't have the means to fight back through the courts, but when people do - they drop the matter entirely.

At this point, we're pretty sure the debt is now time-barred but the collections agency is being really evasive about producing any paperwork about it.  We only have credit reports now that show that the collections agency bought the debt in 2018 but the same reports aren't listing when the debt went into default with the original creditor prior to charge off.

Because we're the executors of this estate, the collections agency is now renewing their efforts to collect with us.   We've explained multiple times that our cousin is dead and we have not acknowledged the debt nor do we intend to pay.   However, they continue to bother us about it.   We think we'd have a much better chance of making them go away permanently if we can produce information that shows that the debt is now time barred or is about to be within the next year.

We previously attempted to get that information from US Bank but the representative we spoke with said since they charged off and sold the debt, they don't have it themselves.   We're not sure if this is actually true but that's what they're telling us.

Does anyone have any advise or insight on how to verify when this debt actually went into collections with the original lender?",personalfinance,1637358767

6,Canceling gym membership for a fraudulent account (second account I did not agree to),"Hi,

in September 2017, a friend came to use the gym with me as a guest. I think he came with me a couple of times - Crunch says 4 times. Someone at Crunch (I think) seems to have created a subscription for my friend (instead of a guest pass) and put me as the master member (don't know what that means exactly). So, I have been paying for a second gym membership since Sept 2017. My friend was in the US on vacation from Sept-Dec 2017 and then returned to the UK. Neither of us would have agreed to this (setting up an annual gym membership for him with me paying)

I went in person to the gym last week and they said this was clearly an error and they would refund the total amount - about $4,000. Interestingly they said that there was a contract but no signature on that contract. However, when I called yesterday to see about this refund, they told me that they will no longer do that. I don't have in writing that they already said they would refund this - they told me in person. They have now discovered a contract signed by my friend but not me - with my address - he was staying at another address.

I have zero recollection of setting up this gym membership and neither does my friend. I also have zero idea or reason why I would pay for his gym membership. These gym memberships have a minimum one year duration.

Finally, I had a gym membership with Crunch gym in Los Angeles since 2015 and closed it in March 2020. They kept charging me membership dues and also refuse to refund the amount I paid - about $800. I have emails showing I canceled in March 2020 but nothing else. I had also called and spoke to someone but forget the details.

What are my options? I contacted my credit card company and they issued a chargeback for $1,498 - the fees for both accounts going back to June 2020. I spoke to the credit card company before I could speak to the gym. They were not returning any of my calls or emails and so I had to go there in person to speak to them.

From the contract:

All claims against Crunch need to go through either the American Arbitration Association or small claims court. Is this something I can do myself or do I need a lawyer. Which of these two is the better option?

13,Applied for a home equity loan to invest the money… Should I do it?,"I bought a house at the end of September all cash for $85,000.

Now, I am considering whether I should get a 30 year home equity loan or not. A lower term isn’t really an option, I’m a sever and on paper I only make $15,000 a year roughly. 22 years old. 

I’ve got about $19,000 in cash currently. I have zero credit card debt, and own my car outright (a 14 Ford Expedition, 168,000 miles and was in a fender bender I took the cash for so probably worth $9k. 

Yearly taxes are $2700 on the house, home insurance is $750 a year, and my car insurance is $1300 a year. Works out to a total of $396 a month roughly. 

I have $10,653 in subsidized student loan debt and am going to have an additional $2653 next semester for $13,306 in student loan debt at 0% interest now, but the rate will be about 4.5% overall when I finish school and it is looking like I’ll need to do at least summer/fall of 2022 part time. The  loan servicer on my loans does offer a .25 percent discount with autopay, so the real rate once I take advantage of that would be about 4.25%. Student loans payments are done over a 15 year period for amounts between 10-20k so I would be paying $100.10 a month after autopay if I do not pay them off. Could possibly also in the future get these to a lower rate if I refinanced privately. 

Going to owe $4153 in the Spring for college as well, which I will pay cash for. 

I can get a home equity loan from KeyBank for a 4.39% interest rate with the only cost of the loan being a $295 origination charge. The APR is 4.427%. There is no prepayment penalty. KeyBank offers a .25% discount for having a checking and savings account open with them, so I already did that when I applied for this loan. Only had to put $10 in each account to open them and no fees, so not a big deal. With that in mind, the rate is then 4.177%. This puts me at a $332 a month payment for the home equity loan after the .25% discount.

In total, I’d be looking at payments of $332 for 30 years, and $100.10 for 15 years for a total of $432.10 as my highest monthly loan payment at any time. 

My plan is to take the $68,000 and immediately put it in mutual funds. I figure a 5-6% return should be realistic over 30 years.

With the student loans, once they start accruing interest I should be able to have the money saved up to put that amount in mutual funds too.

Then, I plan to just make monthly payments on both the loans out of my income until they are paid off. If an opportunity comes up to refinance at a lower rate in the future I would do it.

If I do decide to sell my home before 30 years, it shouldn’t be too big of a hit since there is no penalty for paying the home equity loan off early. 

Am I approaching this correctly? It’s not too risky is it?",personalfinance,1637357183

15,Questions about the recent bill that was passed to eliminate Roths,"I had some questions about the recent bill that was passed to discontinue Roths -- here is an article describing it from the WSJ:

&gt;**A Popular Tax Trick for Savers, the Mega ‘Back Door’ Roth IRA, Is Eliminated in House Bill**  
&gt;  
&gt;Democrats are backing efforts to prevent the wealthiest Americans from shielding multimillion-dollar retirement accounts from taxes  
&gt;  
&gt;The House bill, passed along partisan lines, is expected to be amended by the Senate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Americans would no longer be able to use some popular strategies to move money into tax-free Roth individual retirement accounts under a roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package House Democrats approved on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;The bill, passed along partisan lines and expected to be amended by the Senate, includes a series of provisions Democrats are backing in an effort to prevent the wealthiest Americans from shielding multimillion-dollar retirement accounts from taxes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The IRA measures will raise tax revenue to help pay for items such as universal prekindergarten and lower prescription drug prices. But the impact of eliminating them will go beyond just the wealthy as some people further down the income scale will also be affected.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regular Roth conversions would still be allowed, although starting in 2032, they would be off-limits for people with higher incomes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mega-backdoor Roth strategy lets participants in 401(k) plans that allow after-tax contributions put as much as $58,000 a year into a 401(k) account and convert a substantial chunk of the money to a tax-free Roth account, potentially with a minimal tax hit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting Jan. 1, 2022, the bill would also eliminate backdoor Roth conversions of after-tax contributions of as much as $6000 to traditional IRAs, or up to $7000 for those 50 and older. The strategy is often used by single individuals with incomes above $140,000 and married couples making more than $208,000, who aren’t eligible to make Roth IRA contributions.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the more far reaching IRA and 401(k)-related provisions in the bill wouldn’t kick in for another decade. Starting in 2032, the legislation would prevent single people earning more than $400,000 a year and married couples with incomes above $450,000 from converting pretax retirement-account money to Roth accounts.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a traditional pretax retirement account, savers generally subtract contributions from their income, reducing taxes. Instead, they pay income tax when they withdraw the money in retirement. In a Roth, owners contribute after-tax money, which grows tax-free and can generally be withdrawn tax-free.  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting in 2029, the measure would prohibit contributions to IRAs for single people with incomes over $400,000 and married couples making over $450,000, who have aggregate retirement account balances above $10 million.  
&gt;  
&gt;It would also require higher income people with aggregate retirement-account balances above $10 million to take distributions, regardless of their age.  
&gt;  
&gt;High-balance retirement accounts came under scrutiny after news site ProPublica reported that business titan Peter Thiel amassed $5 billion tax-free in a Roth IRA.  
&gt;  
&gt;Democrats dropped provisions that would have banned holding unregistered securities, including private equity, in IRAs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mega-backdoor strategy rests on a little-known fact about 401(k) plans: The Internal Revenue Service lets employees set aside as much as $58,000 a year in a 401(k) account, a number that rises to $64,500 for those 50 or older. To get to the $58,000 annual limit, a worker can put $19,500—or $26,000 if 50 or older—in either a traditional pretax 401(k) or a Roth 401(k). If the plan allows, the person can also make an after-tax contribution of as much as $38,500.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many 401(k) plans don’t allow mega-backdoor Roth conversions. But in recent years, a growing number have added the feature. It is available at many large companies that employ people with the means to save significant sums, including Aon PLC, Facebook Inc., and AT&amp;T Inc., according to the companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nearly 20% of the 23,500 401(k) plans administered by Fidelity Investments allow the mega-backdoor strategy. Of the 19.5 million people enrolled in Fidelity-managed 401(k)s, 47% are in plans that offer both after-tax contributions and Roth 401(k) conversions, although far fewer use the combination.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the legislation, employees would still be allowed to make after-tax contributions to 401(k)s. But they would no longer be permitted to convert that money to a Roth, where profits can grow tax-free. Instead, they would pay income tax on their investment gains when they withdraw the money.

**Is my understanding correct:**

1/1/22 - no more mega-backdoor Roth conversion.

1/1/22 - no more backdoor Roth conversions of after-tax contributions to traditional IRAs

1/1/29 - no more contributions to IRAs for singles/couples with incomes &gt;$400k/450k

1/1/32 - no more conversions of pre-tax contributions to Roth accounts",personalfinance,1637356715

My husband had an emergency craniectomy in October. He is currently home with a large portion of his skull removed. The neurosurgeon does not expect him to be ready for the bone flap reattachment surgery until January.

I explained to the neurosurgeon’s office that we would greatly prefer the surgery at the end of December so that we would not reach our deductible twice. I was told by their office that since it is a continuation of care surgery that it would still fall under the previous year’s deductible. Does anyone know if this is true in special cases like this?

The biggest issue is that my employer is switching insurance providers next calendar year. HR is telling me that since the surgeon is in-network, there is no need for a transition of care and that any services received Jan 1st onward would go towards the next year’s deductible. In this case I would be reaching my deductible twice and I really can not afford that.

29,Am I paying too much for my house?,"Me (25m) &amp; my wife (24f) are purchasing our second home in the Bay Area in a few months. All the houses we like and are looking at are around 900k. The prices are definitely crazy high but that is just the area my friends and family live in.

We moved away to a low cost of living place after college to buy a cheap condo and save as much money as possible. However, now we both miss our friends and family and want to move back. I’m just worried that we are making a poor financial decision and I don’t want to be stressed out about my mortgage payment each month.

Here is our current financial situation:
- Household Income: 220k , half is our base and half is commission (we are both in tech sales)
- 40k in brokerage account
- 200k in cash for down payment 
- 80k equity in condo (side note we are planning on renting our condo out when we move and not selling it)
- 35k in retirement accounts 

With a house purchase of 920k our monthly payment would be around 4K and just about 40% of our monthly pay. It is more than I would want to pay definitely but we are both young in our careers and think we will be making more money in the near future.

My parents aol email accounts no longer exist as of a few days ago...

My mom and my dad can separately not log into their individual email accounts, and if you send them an email it bounces back.

We called aol and after a lot of transferring and holding, the fraud department told us that somebody called them and showed them proof in the form of bank statements that they are the ones paying for the accounts. This triggered the fraud department to lock the accounts.

Now here’s 2 weird things about this

1) these are free email accounts. We have no idea how somebody was able to prove to aol that they pay for the accounts when we have never paid for them (parents made these accounts in the 90s)

2) my parents are divorced and their email accounts are totally separate. Thus, why did this happen to both of them at the same time? My mom theorizes that they actually did make the emails together under one aol account way back in the day, thus they are linked somehow.

The fraud department told us that the only way to get the accounts back is to send them the following 3 things:

-photo id 
-proof of address
-bank statement showing they paid for the account

The problem is that we have no way to provide a bank statement as we have never paid aol! These are free email accounts!

I tried to get more information but the fraud person told me that we have to send a literal subpoena to aol for more info.

Please don’t go into the comments saying “day-trading is not sustainable, you’re just gambling hurr durr” just yet. 

I agree with you for most cases. I am not day-trading by any means, have a low 7-digit net worth, am investing with a very long-term horizon, hedging/risk-adjusting my positions, and am using different (option) strategies to generate monthly income. My current income/spending situation is easily sustainable. All income will continue to come from the same sources for the foreseeable future. Therefore, achieving a low tax or even zero tax status regarding both short- &amp; long-term capital gains would be optimal.

**My current understanding regarding tax optimization/zero tax for my situation is the following:**

* Cut off all ties to Germany (rental, contracts, etc.)
* Obtain permanent residency in a country with territorial tax system, e.g. Panama
* Income generated outside of my new home country is not taxable. Trading in US markets falls into this bracket. Realized gains are 100% tax free and thus are free to use or reinvest. (Is this even true??)

**There are quite a few unanswered questions that come to mind:**

* Would all my current investments apply to my new tax situation? E.g. realizing gains from profitable positions bought while being taxable in Germany.
* Is every country with a territorial tax system a potential ‘new home’? Which countries qualify for my situation and which are considered ‘easier’ to complete this process compared with others? In general should I consider having tax residency somewhere and reside elsewhere?
* How many months per year am I able to go to Germany before being considered a tax resident again after this change? How about other countries? (&lt;183 days?)
* How is insurance handled?
* Am I able to keep my current bank/brokerage accounts?
* International phone plan or multiple local ones?
* What are some things I should consider getting done before giving up residency? Opening new accounts, health check-up, etc.?
* How long does the process approximately take?

If you can answer any of my questions, point me to sources which I can educate myself with, help me consider some other topics or lend me a hand in any other way, I am deeply thankful!

51,Buying Investment property before first home?,"Hello PF community,

We are currently renting and have been trying to save money for a home. We came across a property that we like because of location and possible renting potential (currently rented out). But if we purchase it now then it will be considered an investment property (as we won’t live in the house in the next year). 

The research we have done So far tells us - we need 20% down
If we take a loan against my 401k it will have  to be paid off faster
We are looking into tax implications

Has someone done this before ? Do you have any thoughts on buying an investment property before buying a first home that you can share ?

Thank you!",personalfinance,1637352039
52,We had our twin boys and their insurance claims are different.,"I just got off the phone with our insurance company. They said that the reason their claims are different, is because one twin met the deductible first before the other. 

I understand this, but there is now a difference in $1,000 between their bills.

Previously, I told the company we owe that we had a financial hardship and that we could not pay the bills. They were able to give us a small discount, but it wasn't as much as I've heard other people get that need assistance.

I asked the insurance agent if they could reprocess the claims and she said no.

Looking at a new home loan of 215k, need to bring 20k to closing. My two options for that cash are:

* Borrow against my 401k at a rate of 4.25% (+$250 processing fee)
* Cash out some of my VTSAX investments

I put out an estimate request on yelp to local body shops and everyone is quoting me between $1000-$2000 to repair both bumper and fender. Most are saying I need to replace the bumper.

I called insurance to see what they'll cover if I file a claim and see if my rate will go up. The person was not really helpful. I have a $1000 deductible for collision so after $1k, they'll cover the rest. They could not tell me if my rate will go up saying ""it all depends on the situation"".

Right now, the only reason I don't want to use insurance is if it increases my rate. I feel like even though I only need to pay a deductible with insurance, if my rate increases, then I'd just end up paying the same or more over time.

I use metromile. if you're unfamiliar with it, basically they charge a base rate and then $X per mile after 100 miles per month. This is perfect for me since I don't have a daily commute anymore.

HSA’s are amazing, but also are seen as good options because of lower premiums. Since I won’t have a premium, is it still a better choice to get a lower quality plan for an HSA? My healthcare costs are fairly low - prescription &amp; a few tests/visits per year. It’s difficult to predict costs which is why 25% coinsurance with the HSA is a little concerning when I have a better &amp; more predictable option.

74,IRS Estimated Tax - Good Enough Amounts?,"If I have regular income from an employer but then make money on the stock market, I understand that I have to pay quarterly payments if I cannot cover the capital gains tax through the W2 income withholdings.

I was originally just making those payments by taking the capital gain in the quarter and then multiplying by my marginal income tax rate at the time. However, I now see that when it comes to reporting those payments when I file taxes next year, Form 2210 has a multistep process to calculating how much you have to pay each quarter if you cannot make regular payments (since I do not know in advance how much more or less I will make the next quarter).

Will calculating the tax owed per quarter using the marginal income tax rate (and perhaps NIIT if applicable) pretty much always exceed the amount owed through the Annualized Income Installment Method? And I presume the IRS will not care if you overpay per quarter?

Just to use an example, say one's W2 income is $100,000 for the year, and withholding is set to single, 0 (pretty much guaranteeing that all of the W2 income will be appropriately withheld).

Now say that capital gains were $20,000, $40,000, $60,000, and $80,000 for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (for a total of $200,000 in capital gains for the year).

Will the marginal rate method always exceed the amount required by the AIIM? E.g., $20,000 x 0.24 for Q1, $40,000 x 0.24 for Q2, $60,000 x 0.32 + $20,000 x 0.038 for Q3, and $80,000 x 0.35 + $80,000 x 0.038 for Q4.

78,Question about Retirement and Inheritance,"So economics is a zero sum game yes? I'm going to employ an example to explain my question in detail.

So when an wlder dies, they pass on their inheritance to their children (typically). Humans did not used to live as long, so most of the money that was accumulated leading up to retirement, was not spent on health care and other costs. Let's assume in this case, that 90% of the initial value was passed on. A reasonable figure.

Modern era. People live longer. It's already happening with the Silent Gen living well into their 80's, 90's, even 100's. This means that in excess of 25% of their entire lives are being spent in retirement. Now go back to the value of savings they had made. They will burn through a looooot of money just to stay alive and be taken care of.

So in summary, the point I'm getting to is: what happens with the concept of inheritance when this occurs? If younger generation naturally had money themselves, they could save and plan for their own retirement, and the cycle would be one of each individual simply savings money throughout their lives, to spend on self care as they get old.

Obviously this is not the case. The economic propects have actually gotten consistently worse since the boomers were young. This is where I arrive at the finale of this post, the grand question:

What money will younger generations be living off of after their boomer parents have lived well into retirement and burned all of their savings? Wages are not increasing proportionally to inflation, stagnant since the 70's. Cost of assets are insane, good luck owning a house unless (once again) it's inherited. 

Of course there are exceptions on an individual level, but im speaking from a macro perspective. What wealth will exist once boomers, given the assumption that the trend of passing wealth through inheritance dies due to long costs of old age health care (and realistically given the spending habits of boomers, they will spend most on cruises).

82,I need a second residence for work. What’s the best way to go about this that benefits me?,"So I’ve lived in North Carolina about ten years and bought a loft condo about two years ago that I love. Not long before buying it, I started the process of transitioning to a new job. Someone I knew in my industry was planning his retirement a few years out, and the goal was that I would be his replacement. He also lives in North Carolina, but the company’s US location is ~4 hours away in Virginia. He travels constantly, so he was allowed to remain in NC and only come to the office when needed. This was going to be my arrangement as well, but in the time it took to hire me, a new manager was put in place who insisted I live in Virginia, despite only really being in the office once every 2-3 months so far. Paying out of pocket for hotels or AirBNB isn’t an option, I am required to have an actual residence. It’s dumb, but not negotiable at this point. I have zero interest in selling my place in North Carolina.

I haven’t lived in an actual apartment in many years, as I had been renting the condo that I bought directly from the owner of the company I used to work for. I spent a few days in VA looking at apartments, and I guess I had forgotten how expensive apartments are, even for places that quite frankly aren’t very nice. Just this morning I took a look at some brand new condos in VA on Zillow that would end up being about the same mortgage payment as the rent on some of the smaller, less nice apartments that I had looked at.

I guess the first question, is there anything I can do that lessens my tax burden if I can show that this home in VA is for work purposes, or does that just not matter? I don’t know a damn thing about taxes, I use the same tax guy as my parents, I just like to educate myself a bit first before going to him. There’s also a tax benefit to owning vs renting, right?

84,Identity Theft and Credit Inquiries Help,"Yesterday I was alerted that my identity (name, DOB, SSN &amp; previous address) had been used to apply for a number of credit cards and personal loans over the past two days. I was alerted through CreditWise and believe I caught it before any accounts were created or funded. There were 5 institutions with hard inquiries on my credit report(s)—and I am working with all of them to make sure the applications are marked as fraud, and the inquiries are removed. I have also frozen all 3 credit reports, and will be filing a police report today.

So as of right now no significant harm was done. But my main question is about my TransUnion Credit Report. I notice their inquiries are separated into 3 categories:

* Regular (Hard)
* Promotional (Soft)
* Account Review (Soft)

Promotional Inquiries are all soft inquiries made for marketing reasons. A TransUnion rep told me that Account Review Inquiries are also soft, but I’m not sure if I should be worried about them. Before the last two days, the Account Review category only consisted of regular hits from CreditWise, and hits initiated by me (mortgage refinance and new credit card earlier in the year). But in the last two days there have been a BUNCH of hits. These hits include:

* Some of the larger banks also included in the hard inquiries
* A number of smaller web-based fast loan companies (Upgrade, Avant, Upstart, Lending Club, Prosper, NetCredit)
* Buy-Now-Pay-Later startups (Klarna, Progressive Leasing)
* A couple of other companies that I am having trouble identifying

I have called all of them. Most of them could find no record of applications or accounts using my SSN, but a couple of them \*DID\*. This worries me that even though these were soft inquiries, there are still potential accounts that COULD be opened in my name. I’m worried that for whatever reason with the companies that found no record, I simply didn’t have the correct information to search for, or I spoke to the wrong person. There are also a few listings I am having trouble getting in touch with. I know for a fact these companies hit my credit for \*something\*. So my main question is—does anybody have any insight on how these companies work, and whether or not I should be worried about accounts being opened in my name—even though they’re just “soft” hits?

Side note: TransUnion and Equifax were relatively easy to deal with—but I can’t obtain a copy of my Experian credit report because the ID thief created an Experian account tied to my social, and I’m locked out of it. I’ve talked to multiple people, and they all say there is some sort of 48-72 hour hold needed for security reasons before they can tie my membership to the SSN. I \*was\* able to add the freeze here, because I guess credit freezes are separate from their memberships. Does this sound right?

1. ) Apply for parent plus in the amount of 10,000 to cover both semesters and pay out of pocket the last semester. ( This will put my current debt for college in total at about 43,000 for 4 years) 

2. ) Apply for a residency appeal in which I can get in state tuition if approved. ( This is a lengthy process but if successful I’ll only have 2,500 to pay for this semester.) 

3.) Use all my savings ( $3000) and try to get a smaller loan for 2,000. ( This option makes me sick to my stomach because I’ll be broke asf. However, I am still working so I don’t doubt I can make this money back but it will be hard.) 

4.) Run away to a new state or country and accept my fate in which my life is over. (Not ideal but I might have no choice) 

Also, my brother is enrolled at the same institution in which he owes 4,087. My father said he is working on getting that money up but this will most likely mean our Christmas will be ruined.

96,Emergency Fund Structure,"So I’ve seen a lot of posts about emergency funds but since I’m luckily in a position where I make good money at a young age ($157K @ 25)  there’s a point where I’ve maxed out my 401K, HSA, and am trying to figure out how to balance between an emergency fund/taxable account/IRA/MBDR.

Goal is to have 9 months of an emergency fund (as an SWE I’ve heard is a bit more bullet proof for recessions than other careers, but I like the option of being able to take my time finding my next role if laid off)

Specifically having the following ideas and seeking feedback:

1) With $4K monthly expense (this is a high ball), keep 30k cash in HYSA. Basically 6 months (4K/m —&gt; 4*6-&gt;24K) in cash, but top to 30K so that each year I can scrape off 6K and dump in an IRA.

2) Keep 24K in a taxable brokerage account (I.E 3 months but doubled up to protect for market downturn, 3x4Kx2) so that I have at least 9 months coverage. 

3) If I meet both the above targets, just keep dumping in the taxable brokerage


I suppose my concern is for my MBDR I’ll have space left in it, about $14K a year. The funds I’d contribute to close that gap would be the funds I’d use to fill my emergency fund, and this is unpredictable (I.E I’d have to keep changing my contribution at work if my fund dips), hence why I tiered a taxable brokerage for the last three months, since if I need to refill cash I just don’t deposit in the taxable account.

Does leaving space in a MBDR to have more convenience in deciding whether to top out my cash emergency fund or the taxable emergency fund sound like a reasonable trade off, or is it horribly inefficient? Is my taxable emergency fund of protecting against at the least a 50% drop sound reasonable (In terms of likelihood, how often has the market crashed that far, I know it’s possible it can lose more, but there’s a risk with investing)? Another reason why  thinking about taxable account vs more MBDR aside from emergency use is flexibility in withdrawals, am I overstating this benefit (I.e is there some kind of withdrawal rule I’m missing)?",personalfinance,1637346473

1,Home purchase gone wrong," Hi  all, first time poster here. My wife and I are currently in tears and  don't know where to turn. We closed on a home in California for 660k  recently, went 100k over asking, waived appraisal contingency, waived  inspection contingency. Just for a little background, we make  approximately 120k combined income, had a good amount of cash from  cryptocurrency to buy our dream home in this crazy hot market (hence  waiving the appraisal contingency). As we moved in, we noticed a foul  smell in a corner of the home, along with some rot in the floor. I had  my brother come over and check it out for us, looks like a sewage pipe  was leaking from the 2nd floor bathroom and caused some mold, along with  foul substance build up in the corner of the house. This was originally  going to be our daughters room, but I cannot put her in it with the  smell / mold. My brother said we were crazy to waive the appraisal  contingency, but thats what this market has caused us to do. He was  looking at the damage to the home, along with some other things that are  not in working condition (HVAC, plumbing issues, old electrical cables)  - he was saying that there are more than likely 50k in repairs needed.  We need to find a way to get our money back on this property, as we can  barely afford the monthly mortgage payments. My wife and I are  distraught. We are trying to figure out who to sue, should we sue the  seller or our realtor ? This home is going to put us in financial ruin,  and were not at fault here.

20,Jumbo Mortgage Cash Out Refi - Buying Points,"Hi,

Quick summary: We've just finished a construction loan and we are looking to do a cash out refinance. We aren't financial experts by any stretch, but for us it seems like a no brainer to buy as many points as possible. Please let me know if we are missing something. Also I recognize that our income and home value etc are high for what is usually discussed in this sub, but hope you will still give us some solid advice as we are a young family who happen to have really high paying jobs, and could use the input. Thank you :)

Household annual income: $490k 
Credit score: 713
Liquid assets and other reserves: $400k
Estimated current property value $1.5m
Estimated loan amount: $1m, 30 year fixed
Cost per point: ~$10k - comes out of the 'cash out' part of the refinance
Principle/Interest as follows: 
0 points ($0) - 3.5%: $4,423
1 point  ($10k) - 3.11%: $4,153
2 points ($20k) - 2.75%: $4,021
3 points ($30k) - 2.5%: $3,891
3.93 points (max we are allowed to buy - $40k) - 2.375%: $3,828

The way I am looking at it, using 3 points as an example: Spending $30k now on the points saves us $532/month or $6,384 annually, which (again, the way I am looking at it...) is a guaranteed ROI of 21% - nothing else is going to give us that kind of return, and so this seems like a no brainer given that we can afford to buy the points. 

Even using the 3.93 points which has considerably less impact on the interest rate, the ROI still looks to be to me ~18% - again, isn't that a no brainer? 

But I feel like I must be missing something...Like we are borrowing $40k at 2.375% interest, to get the 18% return, but how is that not a great idea?

Last year I helped a mother and son fill out FAFSA and this year the son is going to college with a Pell Grant and Federal Work-Study.

This past spring the parents of this boy decided they needed to buy a five-bedroom home.  They each turned to their surviving parent (the non-saving non-planning ahead surviving parent) and managed to get $50k of retirement funds from each.  Twelve years ago they did the same on the previous home before parent deaths and got $20k each (to keep things under gift amount).  The sale of that home left them with $80k in equity (inc the $40k).  So they bought a $250k home with a $180k downpayment.  They work low pay and seasonal jobs.

31,Do I owe the IRS quarterly taxes after selling my options or am I good?,"A few months ago I bought Apple call options for $2,266 and just recently sold them for $4,560. The way I understand it by selling them I now have a realized short term capital gain of $2,294 from my initial investment. My income tax rate is 22% and I calculated that I’ll owe the IRS about $505 or less from the sale (I didn’t calculate the marginal tax I just winged it).

Tax season is coming up and for the past two years I’ve been doing my own taxes (since usually they’re pretty straightforward) but I want to be prepared early because options could possibly complicate them this year. I hadn’t spent any of the money I got from selling the options so I’m prepared to pay the IRS right now if I need to but my question is do I have to pay quarterly taxes in January on my sale or can I just wait and file everything when I get my normal income tax return? 

I understand that you only have to file quarterly taxes if you expect to owe the IRS more than $1,000 but is this based off of my capital gain amount ($2,294) or the amount I owe from my capital gain (&lt;$505)?",personalfinance,1637342272
32,Thoughts on pulling money out of retirement accounts to pay off debt,"Hello all. I am aware that this is Reddit and I will take everything with a grain of salt, but I'm looking to get others' more experienced opinions on my financial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I (24M) have about $3,400 in three different retirement accounts from 2 previous employers and my current one. My wife and I have no children, and our cars are paid off. We currently have about $2,200 in various credit card debt, a mortgage for our house, an $8,500 loan we got for solar panels for the house that we are slowly paying off, along with all the usual monthly utility/phone/etc. bills. I work full-time, and my wife is going to trade school for cosmetology and working part-time. We have usually been good about keeping our credit cards paid off, but the last few months have been tighter financially and we've had to use them a little more to get by.

&amp;#x200B;

We are living paycheck to paycheck, able to keep up on bills and such but we don't have much extra left over for getting our debts paid off or any ""fun"" money to spend on date nights, my old project truck, and whatever else. We don't have any emergency funds built up either, the battery died in my Jeep last week and that sudden $160 expense about broke us for the month, I had to sell a couple things to get by. The stress is really wearing on both of us and our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, should I pull the money out of my retirement funds to pay off some credit card debt in order to have a little money each paycheck to start building an emergency fund and do other things with? I'm aware that I would have to pay taxes on any withdrawals, since the retirement funds were pre-tax payroll deductions. I started my current job a couple months ago and I am pretty close to switching jobs again (for several reasons, but it hasn't really been what I was expecting it to be and I should be able to get better pay elsewhere), which is why I haven't consolidated all of my retirement funds into one account yet.

&amp;#x200B;

$2.8k in delinquencies/collections filed (mostly small $150-200 charges)
$12k student loan - (somehow in good status) that has only been getting paid through IRS garnishment of tax returns (starting to pay this heavily now, was really hard to even figure out who I owe and how much)
$20k car loan - in good status

39,Should I buy another critical illness insurance?,"I’m in my early 40s. I currently have the below insurance:
- a few dividend-paying life insurance policies with savings feature. These will all be paid up within the next 10 years. If I terminate all of these at 65, the total guaranteed cash value will be around $70K. 

- a critical illness insurance that expires at age 65. 

I’m considering whether to get another critical illness insurance that offers lifetime protection. Below are the key details of the plan that I’m considering: 

- premium will be paid up when I’m around 65. 
- total premium paid will be around 5K less than the coverage amount (45K premium for 50K coverage)
- the plan offers up to five claims for certain illnesses such as cancer, heart attack and stroke
- cash value is available if the plan is terminated, but at a much lesser amount than the coverage amount

It seems that it’d only be worth it if I either file a claim before the premium is paid up, or file two claims, but I wonder if I’m missing an angle.",personalfinance,1637341403

57,Can I afford this house?," 

My wife (24) and I (27) put an offer on a house listed for $300k. It is in a fantastic location, and definitely has a ton of potential as a future rental property. We are currently in the option period and have 3 more days to make a decision.

Some context on our financial situation and the needs of the house:

Our situation:

* Paid off all debt
* Both have undergrad degrees in STEM and I have a masters in Engineering
* Conventional loan with 3% down and 3.75% interest

My situation:

* Currently make $90k base + $13k-$17k in cash bonuses each year
* Been working for just under 2 years
* Work in tech at the lowest point positionally in my career
* Expecting a promotion in the coming weeks with a good raise
* Lots of opportunities for advancement

My wife's situation:

* Makes between $45-$55k per year
* Works PRN in the medical field
* Not a lot of opportunity for growth
* She will potentially stop working when we have kids in a few years

General info and pros about the house:

* Pier and beam
* The back yard goes up a hill so the house sits below
* Near downtown
* In one of the fastest-growing zip codes in the US
* Walking distance to many tourist destinations
* $300k is very rare for this location
* Had a previous buyer a week ago back out for unknown reasons
* have an inspector coming out today to look at the foundation
* .25 acre lot
* brand new bathrooms
* 1400 sq ft
* 3 bed 2 bath
* near golf course

Cons about the house:

* Roof needs replacement
* A/C at end of like
* Pier and beam needs adjustment
* Carpenter ants on the property (10ft diameter about 50 ft from the house)
* 3 trees too close to the house
* kitchen needs remodeling
* some electrical not up to code (nothing major)
* bad water drainage
* unknown rot from water or damage from ants
* weep holes filled in
* built in the 60's
* Bathrooms detached from the master bed
* If the inspector says the foundation is fine, there's always the potential that there is unseeable rot or damage to the walls.

Have some general questions about my next steps regarding housing","I'm 22M and about to graduate with my Masters in computer engineering, and I'm starting my job with the company I interned for nearly 2 years (as of next May) with right after graduation. Pay is about $110k with a $25k bonus, in an area with I believe medium COL (mid-Hudson NY). Decided that to save a bit of money and enjoy being with family one last time before heading off on my own, I'll be staying with my parents for a few years completely rent free (which i know I'm very lucky to be able to do and am very grateful). I want to buy a nice car ($35-50k) both because I'm not sure how much life is left in mine and I want to treat myself a bit for graduating and living fairly frugally for most of my life. I expect that at home, my expenses will exclusively be car payments, insurance, whatever I spend when i hang with friends, and occasionally helping around the house. Hard to predict the future as I don't have any checks yet, but I expect to pocket about $4.5-5k monthly at home after taxes, payments, insurance, and expenses. I have a few questions about what I want to do in the coming years (which is all very tentative of course).

* After 3 or so years of living home, I'll probably get sick of living there, plus my gf will be done with her masters at that point most likely, so I'll want to move out with her. We both seem to be falling into the ""rent is a waste of money"" mindset that I've heard is kinda poison around here. If I expect to save ~$150k+ in my time at home, should I consider buying a condo or townhouse (exclusively in my name) at around $150-250k? Advantages would be no ""throwing money away"", owning equity, being able to mostly do what i want (like install an EV charger, for example), and being able to rent it out once I leave, while downsides would be financial inflexibility, variable costs, and possibility of needing to just dump the place for below market rate if I need to move in a hurry (though I would hope to be able to rent it out instead).

* If I live with my gf in my own mortgaged property, I'd probably want to charge her rent. The amount would be proportional to both of our incomes as well as the market rate, but she'd of course get a significant discount from said market rate while I'd have the advantage of not being solely responsible for my mortgage (of course I'd only buy a property I can afford with no help). She would get no equity in the home by renting, but I'd also offer her the value that she's paid into the home by renting once we get married (eg if she pays 35% of the mortgage as rent, I'd give her approximately that much equity in the home after marriage). Does that sound like a fair or logical arrangement?

* The biggest question mark in the housing situation is long-term plans. Unfortunately my career field pretty much only exists in Austin, San Francisco, San Diego, and Portland, with a few offshoots in my area (extremely lucky for me) and Boston. That means that if I want to climb the ladder by jumping around jobs, I'd have to consider moving across the country. GF's field (neuropsych/husbandry) is a bit more flexible but still centered around major urban areas. I expect that once we're in our 30s (5-10 years after moving out of my parents' place), we'll want to look into a permanent home suitable for kids, be it here or further west. That window seems to be right around the window of ""profitability"" on owning a small property, though I'd prefer to keep the property and rent it out even if I move cross-country, at least until it's paid off. Does that sound reasonable, or does the situation pretty much mean a mortgage is unrealistic/inconvenient and I'm better off just paying rent until I decide for sure where I want to live and just go all in on the nice house later?

Thank you for reading through this and please lend me your thoughts. Of course everything here is extremely tentative, and I'm mostly spitballing ideas to consider far later.",personalfinance,1637336747

73,Long Term Investment Options,"What's the benefit of investing in individual stocks for a long term Investment? Are there any? From a very surface level comparison, I would think investing in mutual funds or index funds would be a better option for a long term standpoint.

For instance if you had $1M at age 20 wouldn't it be better to just invest it in a fund that averaged 8-16% over it's lifetime (making it a huge range in order to generalize), rather than investing in tons of individual stocks? It seems much more risky to just pick and choose stocks, though I suppose the risk also could come with reward.

Question about my credit card balance that I couldn't find online. Long story short, years ago I had about 15K credit card debt, 20K LOC and a trash score. I've since paid it all off, maxed my TFSA, healthy RRSP and credit score 790. Credit card has been paid in full every month for 3 years and no missed payments on other minor debts. 

For the first time in a few years, I had some things come up last month that required some heavy credit card spending. I can pay off about most of it with my regular chequing account income. 

3K credit card bill, I can afford to pay off about 2700 without missing any other payments. I hate pulling from my investments, and would rather pay the interest on $300 than touch them. (financially, it doesn't make sense, I know that, but I have a disciplined saving strategy because of my past habits).

I have constantly been getting emails and calls asking for interviews. The issue is, most of these jobs are trying to lowball me on salary offers. I found one company I like and the interview process went great. When she asked how much I would like to make I said I basically said I would need atleast what I was making at my previous job to accept a job here. Even with what I make now things have been a struggle with the price of everything going up. She wrote down what I asked for ($20) and said “I am going to be honestly with you that is on the high end of what we normal pay for this position. This position usually pays $17-18 an hour. But I will talk to my boss and see what I can do.” I did look on Glassdoor and most people in this position make about $17 an hour. But those are people who do not have their degree, certifications, or training that I have spent years doing already. I got an offer in my email this morning for $18 an hour. My question is, how do I negotiate this? $18 is better then most places in my area for this position, but is still not what I wanted. I was really hoping for $20.

I like having the freedom to choose my own investments vs my company’s 401k which has a few funds I can pick from. I’ve been very fortunate in getting promoted however and I now find my income in the Roth limit range. So two questions.

I don’t know exactly how much I’ll make end of year due to bonuses and such. I’ve already contributed the full $6000 to my Roth, if it turns out my income (MAGI) is such that I can only contribute, let’s say $4800, does the IRS just make me withdraw $1200 from my Roth?

Second, are my dreams of Roth IRA dead? I’d imagine within the next 2-3 years I’ll be past the maximum MAGI limit. Is my only retirement saving option ( apart from my employer 401k) just a non tax advantaged account?

6,Collection Agency called me and was as confused as I am?,"So long story short: collection agency told me I owe $2,800 for a medical bill for which I'm on a payment plan with the ER (COVID scare, didn't have COVID). Need some help for next steps. 

The CA saw the payments coming in every month and has reached back out to the ER. I reached out to the ER as well. 

ER tells me that they see where I called in and told them I will be paying monthly. And they see I have paid consistently through a bill pay from HSA. But they still gave the debt to a collection agency? They say I did not set up a payment plan????

My plan: call ER, ask them to bring the account back from collections and continue my payment plan.

If the ER doesn't take the medical bill back from collections I think I have two options. Which one do you think is the better option? Or do you have another option?

1. Let the debt go to collections. Continue the same payment plan I have with the ER paying it monthly until it's paid off. It won't be incurring interest so that's a plus.  (I hate this plan! I have no collections and my credit score is a 786, I'm not really trying to ruin my credit. I heard new scoring models give medical bills less weight, but still...)

2. Try to settle the debt. I heard that medical bills have 180-day period before they show on the credit report, so if I pay it quickly maybe it won't show up on CR? (Not sure if that's the case).

Unfortunately I would have to pay for the debt with CC and perhaps roll it over to a interest-free transfer situation. Only because I'm cash strapped because I JUST PAID a bunch of medical bills! So the HSA is near empty and my savings is near empty as well 😩, I honestly thought all the medical stuff was squared away. In hindsight I shouldn't have used my emergency savings to pay those other medical bills.

One of the alerts came with a name, I googled them and it seems like they come from the city I was born in and are a similar age, so I think they're just writing down their own SSN wrong.


Is there anything I can do about this? Nothing has changed on my credit report (I check it fairly often) but I get a new alert every few months and it gives me a lot of anxiety. I looked into reporting it but given nothing false is on my credit report it looks like my only option is to monitor it.

9,Safe growth ETFs (need advice),"Hello, I'm new to investing and with what I've learned/researched online so far, I came up with the following investments for my brokerage account every month:

* 25% in VTI
* 25% in VUG
* 25% in QQQM
* 25% in IBUY

1.) Is this a good split and choice of ETFs? What are the odds that I will face massive losses in the next 15 years?

2.) A follow up question is, if I want to live off the 4% rule when I retire in 15 years, I'd probably have to move the funds in these risky ETFs to more stable ones. Since this is a taxable account, I'd lose some of the money to capital gains tax. How does that compare to just putting everything into VTI+VOO right now itself, and not getting hit by tax later?

12,Is it worth taking out a small car loan for credit history purposes?,"I'm looking around for a used car and am considering buying one in the $7,500 range that I could easily pay for in cash. I've also thought about taking out a $5k loan on it but the rate would probably in the 6-7% range. I would probably end up just doing a 12 month loan to pay it off sooner rather than later (maybe even pay it off in 6 months time anyway). 

My reasoning for potentially taking out the loan is two-fold

1. While I can buy it outright, I do have some other large purchases on the horizon. With buying it outright there's a slight chance I would need to dip a little bit into my 6 month emergency fund money. I would likely be able to replenish it relatively quickly but the loan could provide peace of mind in not having to do that.

2. I feel like the car loan could potentially provide a little bit of a bump to my credit history. I'm not currently planning to buy a house anytime soon but I figure that my sparse credit history could potentially be to my detriment when I eventually do.

My credit history only really has 3 items on it. Two credit cards that I pay off in full every month (7 and 3 year histories). And a $10k loan that I paid off early. When I paid off the loan my credit score went from 810 to 795 and has stayed there ever since. 

I know I shouldn't get wrapped up in credit score since 795 is already considered pretty good, but I can't help but feel like only having 1 loan on my credit history could be a ding against me when I do eventually start looking to buy a home. I suppose my thought process is if I was loaning someone a large amount of money based off their credit history I would be more likely to approve/give a better rate to someone who has always paid on time plus has a couple of loans under their belt rather than always paying on time with only one loan under their belt.

I’ve secured a super casual job - 3 hrs a day when i can work but the pay is decent imo.

My friend wants to move out with me so that’s $150/each, maybe less if we’re lucky. 

I calculated my expenses which would average $300 max per week. 

So i’d be with $40 excess, maybe more as i get allowances for studying and might get more when i move out. 

I am still looking for a more permanent job that can guarantee a more stable income, but is it crazy to think i can move out with the amount i’ve mentioned? i’m gonna be working and savings everything as we aim to move out Mid Jan, but my mental health is declining at home and id rather struggle than be here any longer. 

i’m just scared it’ll be in over my head and have to return home. My friend earns plenty, she could move out alone but hasn’t yet. and i couldn’t afford it myself either. idk sorry if this isn’t allowed i feel i need some motivation or advice?

I believed this was the right move because I hate being in debt (pay off my credit cards in full every month, $0 in debt). 

I paid for a car outright for $3500 off Craigslist. Even had a mechanic friend look it over and give me the go ahead. 

Not even A YEAR LATER, and I've spent THOUSANDS on repairs for this car. The worst part is the clutch has started to slip and there are major leaks.

29,American abroad with tax question on collecting rent,"I asked my accountant about this but I want to hear other opinions too.

I'm an American living abroad, so I still need to file taxes back to the US. I've earned under the foreign earned income exemption each year so I haven't had to pay anything, but I still need to file. I've had a boring life of just being employed or selling shit on Etsy so it's been pretty straightforward.

My husband is not American, so I do married filing separately. His income never appears on any of my tax declarations.

We currently own the apartment we live in. We have 50/50 ownership of it. We're planning on buying a new place, and renting out the old place to a tenant and collecting rent.

My accountant has advised me that nothing much will change in terms of how I file my taxes or the documents I need to provide. I will need to report half the rent, but it won't be considered as normal ""income"" and therefore not exempt under the foreign earned income thing, so I might be taxed on it by Uncle Sam.

Does this sound right? Any idea how much I'd get taxed? Any advice for how else to handle this?

My husband and I talked briefly about putting ownership fully in his name to avoid the US taxes on my half, however we prefer to keep all our post marriage assets 50/50 both to be fair and in case anything should happen to one of us. So ideally we find a way to deal with Uncle Sam that doesn't ruin the whole point of collecting rent in the first place.

41,How to determine which stocks to sell to minimize taxes?,"Let's say I have a bunch of stocks, and for each I have their selling price and the tax I would have to pay on each. I want to meet a threshold of liquidity (say for downpayment on a house). I want to determine which stocks I should sell to meet the downpayment while minimizing taxes. Assume I am equally bullish on all stocks. Also assume income is greater than 500K so all long term taxes are 20%.

Is the following strategy correct?
It makes sense to sell the ones where I am making losses, so sell those first.

Next, sort the stocks in ascending order by the tax I would pay on them. Select stocks from top to bottom and add their selling prices, stopping when the sum is greater than the desired downpayment threshold.

There's a caveat though. Say I have two stocks A and B with equal capital gains ($100 say). A has a selling price of $1000 while B has a selling price of $200. In this case, since the tax will be the same on selling either A or B, but the revenue generated is larger by selling A, I should prefer A over B.

The way to incorporate this into my strategy above is to do a second sort by selling price, i.e., sort by tax, then among those stocks with same tax, sort in descending order by selling price, and then run the summing step as above.

Is this correct? I understand that there are some border cases when I am close to the threshold (I can sell a stock with higher tax and higher revenue to get over the threshold than going in the sorted order), but ignoring this, is the above strategy correct?",personalfinance,1637306772

I know lots of ""in the know"" financial people use it as another form of retirement account. I've been saving the receipts of all qualified medical expenses for the last, like, 2-3 years waiting to reimburse myself decades from now (at least that's the plan).

If I can reimburse myself tax-free from my HSA account for qualified medical expenses, why wouldn't I do this semi-regularly? Why wait 10-30+ years down the line to pay myself back and risk lawmakers changing the rules on the time-limit for reimbursement or any other thing that could effect the greatness of HSA's?

For example, I want to reimburse myself $1000 from my HSA. If I own XYZ stock in my HSA (assume the value of the stock is greater than $1000), I'd sell some of it &gt; transfer cash into bank account &gt; transfer cash to taxable brokerage account &gt; buy XYZ stock in taxable account. If I ever want to sell this stock in the future, assuming long-term capital gains, I could potentially be paying 0% in taxes for it anyway.

Backup plan is to buy a fixer upper cash, even if I have to liquidate everything, but there are few houses that meet the criteria I need.   Since I know this is going to be one of the first things someone brings up, I don't require an emergency fund, and unexpected repairs should not be an issue, as I will factor in every possibility on any house I look at. I just want to know where to put the money that will gain maximum return with absolute minimum risk, as I don't know if I will find a house in 2 weeks or 8 months, but it's coming in the short term.",personalfinance,1637299795

* I’d sleep better at night knowing we have 9ish months of expenses in emergency savings (currently 7ish months)
* Student loan debt/car interest rates is probably lower than investment returns
* My car is old and if I needed another would cut into emergency savings, especially given current market
* Kids: probably 2-4 years away (obviously require cash/cash reserve)
* Upcoming April ‘22 honeymoon: owe $3200 still which will be drafted in February, already put deposit down and paid for flights, wedding covered by her parents
* Home repairs/upgrades: severely outdated main bathroom, AC/Heating units are all 17 years old but currently working

61,"Recently laid off, question about 401k withdrawal","I was recently laid off and will receive a monthly severance for 2 years. I have a decent amount of money in a 401k that I plan on rolling over into an IRA. I am pregnant and due in February so I will be taking full advantage of my paid severance.

We recently discovered our home had some foundation damage. We've lived here a little over a year before we noticed some large cracks in the outer walls around an addition. The repairs would be $10-$15k. I am considering taking a withdrawal from my 401k. Before being laid off the only kind of withdrawal I could have taken was a hardship withdrawal with no penalty. Unfortunately, our needed repair didn't qualify for this. So after my layoff I could take a withdrawal, but it would be taxed/penalized at 25%. The 401k manager also told me it would be subject to taxation when I file my end of year taxes. Does using this money for home repairs help me in any way in that regard? Or does it matter at all how the money is spent? I've never had to pay in at the end of the year and am worried that it would be a big hit after just having a baby.

I have a pension (need to figure out if rolling it over is even possible without having to take a tax hit) as well as a 403b (deferred compensation) from my previous employer and would like to roll it into something. My new employer does not offer matching, not even a 401k, until after a year (which is unfortunate because the employer responses to reviews on glassdoor mentioned mentioned that they are available immediately). Hr said they use John Hancock and that I could make contributions to a traditional IRA for the year and that way it’s at least with the same company. However, it sounds like John Hancock isn’t the greatest. 

I currently have a vanguard Roth IRA. Should I just max that out and setup a traditional IRA with vanguard as well (and try to max that out as well)? Any reason to setup (or not to) setup the traditional IRA through John Hancock?

Also I’m considering keeping my pension with my previous employer. I’m vested so the way that it works is at 62 I get 15% of the average of my last three years of employment (roughly 15% of $75k) which ends up being just shy of a grand a month for life. To me that sounds decent and depending on how long I live might be better than pulling out and investing it myself (correct me if I’m wrong).

The pay is more than my current rate (which is my base rate hourly).. but I do make about the same with the extra differentials for working all the shifts that I wouldn’t have to work with the new job.. I do not have the experience specifically for the role but it comes with a lot of time sensitive projects and many more responsibilities. Even though I know the organization well, (which is half the job description), I’ll have to give my 150% due to time sensitivity of the project and having to answer to all the big wigs at my workplace. I was told even with my 8 yrs of experience in my current role and by extension in healthcare, I wouldn’t be considered at the new jobs pay range because I have no experience. They are giving me credit for half the time of those 8 as I guess I’ve been at this institution for about 4 yrs. I think that they are low balling me by saying I don’t have the experience to give me what they would to another candidate, but they wouldn’t be super interested if they thought I couldn’t do the job.. plus they need someone as the project deadline is within months. The other thing I’m being told is that the raises are not merit based, so I will be stuck with the mere 2%…and since it’s salaried, I am basically not getting even base rate for the extra hours I’ll be putting in every week (which I am calculating at 2hrs per week at an average since it could range from 40 HR workweek (mostly) to 60 hrs base on the most busy weeks, which I anticipate like 6-7 in a year) Though I accept that I won’t have to work off shifts, and that on paper the hourly rate looks like an 8% increase, they would have paid someone else 14% more to do the same job. This is according to the salary range for the new job that I was given by the hr recruiter..

I think the job will definitely push me to learn and do way more and will have its stressors, and I’m super interested to go for it but I feel like I’m being punished for no experience (since they already know my salary, which btw in my current department, the range starts 12% lower than what the new dept starts at) &amp; that I’m not being given a chance to get reassessed for the very intensive year I’ll have and the experience I’ll gain.. I was hoping that at least with this admin position, I’d have merit based raise to which I could have swallowed a year of less pay, but the set rate of increase is not helpful.

I am starting to wonder if I'm an idiot. So, I'm self-aware in that one thing I've always been bad at managing/handling is money. Knowing this, I decided to seek out a financial advisor to help me better manage my money as I finally landed a dream job. This advisor is from NWM and gave me what I felt till now was quite solid advice. He made statements about how my first step was to build a cushion/safety net with some savings, and I thought that was a great start. Then he suggested that I should consider life insurance. He explained that in a situation where I get disabled, NWM would supplement my employer's provided life insurance to get my disability coverage to match my monthly salary. That option was term insurance, but then he mentioned whole life insurance, and how at 10 dollars more a month ($40 total), I would get much more added benefit as there was a cash value aspect and that this could be used in the future for things like collateral. Now, the genius that I am, I did the deep google dive after the fact and read so many conflicting reviews that I don't know what to do or think anymore. Was this a terrible decision? Is there any merit? I'm currently in underwriting steps, so I believe I could pull out if that is what is recommended.",personalfinance,1637295356
74,My bank is going to close my account because it thinks I was involved or a victim of a scam???,"I am 20/F. The bank in question is Capital One. I realize how sketchy this might seem, but bear with me. 

I have a friend.

It’s just that - he’s in South Africa. And not the good parts. He says he hates living there, because the country is corrupt and he is unable to get any kind of job. He can’t even have a bank account in his country without worrying about someone coming along to steal his money, because the banks there are not trustworthy. So in order to survive, he has to think outside the box. 

And he trusts me, while also owing me a ton of money he has been trying to pay me back for. 

So he proposed an idea to me - I had a bank account that I never use with literally .60 in it(Capital One). 

There are some people who are in school over there where he lives, their parents want to send them money. However Bitcoin is the fastest means of getting and receiving money, according to him. 

So where we would come in, is we would take their money, use that account to hold it, and he would send the requested amount to whoever the Client needed it sent too. Clients as in, people wanting to send money to their kids. We would take their money, turn it into Bitcoin, and then send it to their kids for them. They would pay us a small amount for doing so. There is nothing illegal about this, at least that we are unaware of. 

His friends Uncle allowed his friend to borrow $45k from him, and he lives in California. So we were tasked with sending that $45k back to his uncle - to which we were getting $1700 for doing so. So the total was actually like $47k sent. 

But I gave my friend access to this bank account - since I don’t use it for anything else. I have a separate bank account I use to keep money from work in with Chase. But Capital One is the one he had access too. 

When he tried to send the money to the account though, my friend linked a different account under someone else’s name, which the money was a direct deposit, so it went through but didn’t show up. 

This caused my bank to send me an email about suspicious activity. I had to call to verify what was going on - and they informed me the linked account was not allowed because it wasn’t under my name. My friend apparently did this while I was busy, and he felt bad about bothering me, which is why he decided to do that. His friend warned him but he didn’t listen. 

But when I called, I didn’t realize this had happened. I thought maybe it was just because a large sum of money had been transferred. 

But the lady on the phone - when she realized I didn’t know what she was meant by linked accounts, she started asking more questions. 

When I tried to tell her I was just holding the money and it was meant to be turned into Bitcoin - she told me “that is simply not logical” and further questioned me. She honestly made me feel pretty dumb. I felt like a child being interrogated by my parents. 

But I informed her it wasn’t me that had put the linked account, but my friend. She asked if I had given him information, and I told her yes, but she responded the sign ins were from all over, like California, New York. 

My friend did use a fake number. He put the clients number as a sort of trust fund, thinking it would notify them when we sent their money to where it was supposed to go. But he messed up by doing this, because it looks terrible on paper and like a ton of people were logging in from all over when that was just him messing around. It also doesn’t work that way, or notify when money is transferred that way. 

But him doing that screwed us over, because on paper I understand how it would seem like I was part of a scam. 

But in essence, the bank said they would no longer be doing business with me, and locked me out of the account. I asked if they would be sending the $45k back to the account it came from - but they wouldn’t give me a clear answer. 

They wouldn’t tell me what they were going to do with the money in the account at all. Just said they will figure it out. 

Like they can’t just keep the money can they? That doesn’t belong to the bank. I swear this probably does look bad, but it’s not at all how it seems.",personalfinance,1637295138

76,Buying my first car without a loan,"Hi,

I just turned 29 and I would like to buy my first car for my 30th birthday next October. I've been freelancing most of my life and in my country banks/insurances don't really trust people with ""non-traditional"" revenue streams. I've never taken any credit before, but since I'm now able to save a decent amount of money I thought I'd just save until I can afford the car I want. I could still get a credit if I really wanted to but I like the idea of staying credit free.

I don't want to spend over 20K USD, but I'll be saving about $25K between now and December 2022, so this covers the budget. However that would also mean less money going into my emergency fund so I have a couple of basic questions.

- Should I create a separate bank account just for this project or just ""merge"" it with my emergency fund? My reasoning is that the higher the amount in my account, the higher the interest rate (my bank offers up to 4.5% for accounts with over $20K) so is splitting the money worth it?

- I've seen a few years ago that the emergency fund should cover at least 6 months of your monthly expenditures if you are freelancing, and I've been living by this rule since. But I'm still uncomfortable with the idea of spending around 65% of what I'll have in bank in next October. Is there any other rule of thumbs I should be aware of? 

Any advice would be appreciated because I've always lived with that kind of uncertainty, focusing on essential expenditures and saving as much as I can, with good and bad months although things have gotten a lot more stable in the past couple of years.

* Personal Brokerage Account: $13,000 ish
   * 33% VTSAX
   * 66% Same sports gambling and video game stocks

80,"Using a personal loan, to pay off another personal loan, just because I can?","In August 2021, I financed a vehicle with a secured personal loan, through OneMain Financial, using the vehicle as the collateral.

All is well, my payments are set on auto draft. I have additionally made an extra payment of 20%.

I have received an email from OneMain Financial offering me to apply for a new secured loan, with a 20% increase in borrowed amount, a skipped payment, the new loan would pay off and close the previous loan, and I could keep the difference in cash.

I am not interested as I consider this tedious to spend my time on.

…But… Then I questioned, theoretically say the interest and terms stayed the same or became better, would I benefit from having a personal loan closed for credit reasons, specifically, that would make it worth my time?

Wouldn’t this also put another hard inquiry on my report, and should I also consider that as well?

Would there be any benefit to using the offer to have a loan paid off in full and closed; even though another would be opened, increasing my debt?

I would put all of the difference between the loans, back into the first payment I would be ‘skipping’ and be in the same place dollar for dollar after all is said and done, I don’t need the cash or want the debt raised; but I would like to improve my credit.

Thank you.

When I received my W2s for that year, I was listed as a resident of DC and filed federal and DC taxes. Two years later I start getting notices from the Franchise tax board of California (FTBC) saying I never paid my state taxes and that I owe hundreds of dollars.  The problem is, I never lived or worked in the state of California.  

I called the FTCB and let them know about the mistake.  They tell me this can be fixed by submitting copies of my W2 showing my address in DC,  a copy of my state tax returns, and a letter explaining the error.   I sent over this information and expected that to be the end of it. It was not the end of it, a few months later another letter arrives saying I still owe taxes and now I owe late fees.  Again, I reach out to the FTCB to let them know about the error and ask if they ever received the documents I sent a few months ago.

At this point I'm frustrated so I call them again and ask to speak to the head the department who handles these things and hopefully get it all resolved.

88,Tips for Picking a 529 plan?,"I want to start a 529 for my 1 year old, but finding the number of plans available to be overwhelming. I almost want to just choose my state's plan because having any plan has to be better than no plan, but figured I'd ask here first in case my state's is truly awful.

We live in NJ. My partner and I are each already contributing significantly to our own 401ks and Roth IRAs; we have a mortgage but no other loans. We plan to contribute a yearly gift to our daughter, as well as any large gifts she gets from grandparents, etc for birthdays and holidays.

FWIW I have tried googling this, but the results don't seem reliable? [This article is only 5 months old and was in the top search results](https://clark.com/personal-finance-credit/investing-retirement/529-plan/#clark) but lists NJ state plans as not worth investing in because it has high costs (defined as &gt; 0.40%) and doesn't offer a tax deduction. But [NJ's plan's site](https://www.njbest.com/njbest/resources/faqs) says ""The program management fee is currently 0.10% annually"" and it will begin to offer tax deductions in 2022 (for gross incomes &lt; $200k, which we may exceed in a few years, but I'll cross that bridge when we get to it).

So

* How can I find a plan's total fees and expenses? I'm worried about NJ site saying 0.10% but that article saying it's over 0.40% -- is there something I'm missing about NJ's plan, did I misunderstand the article, or did the article get it wrong / use out-of-date info?
* How often are these numbers (fees and tax deductibility) likely to change? If they do change, would it ever be in an unfavorable direction? (Eg NJ moving from non-deductible to deductible is a favorable change so I'm not going to complain about that.)
* If a grandparent also in NJ contributes to the NJ plan, the grandparent gets the tax deduction, right? So it'd be dependent upon *their* income not exceeding the limit, not mine?
* Anything other factors I should consider when choosing a plan, or anything else I should know?",personalfinance,1637293095
89,Safe growth advice,"Hello, I'm new to investing and with what I've learned/researched online so far, I came up with the following investments for my brokerage account every month:

25% in VTI
25% in VUG
25% in QQQM
25% in IBUY

Is this a good split and choice of ETFs? What are the odds that I will face massive losses in the next 15 years?

A follow up question is, if I want to live off the 4% rule when I retire in 15 years, I'd probably have to move the funds in these risky ETFs to more stable ones. Since this is a taxable account, I'd lose some of the money to capital gains tax. How does that compare to just putting everything into VTI+VOO right now itself, and not getting hit by tax later?

Currently I have a high-deductible plan with an HSA through my employer (have approx 4k saved in the HSA currently an on track to max my annual contributions), and my husband has a regular non-high deductible plan through his employer. His open enrollment ends next week and we're trying to decide if I should switch to his plan now or wait another year. My plan has a $1,500 deductible and $5k out of pocket max. We expect we'd have to pay a couple hundred a month more by adding me to his plan. (And long term, I plan on leaving my job to take care of the child, so I'd eventually get added to his plan anyway). My hesitancy is that if it takes a while and I don't get pregnant, we'll be paying so much extra for nothing basically, AND I'd lose out on the ability to save up contributions in my HSA for a year. I've heard that HDHPs aren't a great idea if you're expecting high health care costs - would it be worth it to switch now rather than risk being stuck on my current plan for delivery?",personalfinance,1637292382

99,"Sister wants to invest in a house I own, what are the options?","A bit of a sad but I'm sure common scenario; I had to buy my mum and dad's house from them when we found out my mum had stage 4 cancer to secure a place to live for my dad (both retired, and no chance of dad getting a mortgage, it was in mum's name only). House was valued at £120K, mum gifted me the equity of £75K made up of £60K from sale of previous house, and mortgage payments we'd jointly made. I took out a mortgage of £45K, 3% 32yrs and have been paying that for about 5yrs. Though the house is legally mine, we have a written agreement that the gifted equity be split 50/50 and therefore sister has a stake of 35K against my 40K, mine being larger because of overpayments to mum's mortgage whilst she was still alive.

Sister has come into money and wants to increase her share to 50% by a cash investment plus commitment to pay half the mortgage repayments each month. 

I've put about 17k into the house made up of 5k mortgage overpayments mentioned earlier plus about 12k in mortgage repayments. Simplest and most straightforward option for me is for sister to pay 17k off the mortgage (and take care of 1.2k overpayment fee for doing so) which then brings out respective investments equal. Plus, written agreement to pay 50% monthly repayments indefinitely (about 15yrs until mortgage cleared with the overpayment).

Sister wants instead to pay me half of what I have already invested =8.5k plus the mortgage repayments split.

Appreciate the legal fragility of promises to make monthly payments etc., plus we do not have a deed of trust in place, but for the sake of the post would request to put that aside. Above info recorded in my will at least to ensure fair probate.

How the hell are these arrangements calculated financially, are there any other cost models than the two mentioned? The mortgage would still be in my name only, should I expect something for taking all the risk and admin burden. What would you do? Long term plans are to rent the place out when vacant. And I know the mortgage is a shitty deal, but it costs me about 180/month and I'm happy to let trickle on in the background until fixed term over in 18months.

2,Pension Buyback or IRA?,"Hi all, 

So I have a decent job working for the local government, which has a great benifits package, including a pension. I've been in the job for 6 years now, but for the first 4 years I was in what they call a ""temporary assignment pool (TAP)"", which comes with almost no benifits (no pension, no healthcare, no vacation, 3 sick days... literally the bare minimum).

Now that I'm a full employee I have the option to ""buyback"" my pension for the 4 years I was on TAP, which essentially amounts to paying the current worth of what I would have put into the pension. So, the longer I wait to do the buyback the more expensive it becomes. I could do it all at once, pay installments, or set it for automatic paycheck deductions. Ultimately, I want to do it, since the pension amount paid is a factor of how long you've been paying into it.

At the same time, I also have a Roth IRA, which rolled over from an old 403B from a previous job. I've been putting in the max every year. With my investments, mostly ETF and a few stocks here and there, the IRA has been doing pretty well... though not well enough to feel comfortable retiring on in 25 years.

So here is my conundrum, I've recently come into a small sum (about $10K), and am looking to squirrel it away for retirement. Should I sink it all into the pension buyback? Should I still try to max out my IRA for the year? Should I dump it all into ETFs and do automatic paycheck deduction?

What would you do with the extra money? Between the raise and 401k “extra” have about 10% of my income to play with. (We are at a comfortable place right now with income, not the richest people in the world, but also not worrying about how well pay bills or put food on the table). 

I’m considering just adding 6% to the 401k to bring my contribution up to 15%, but I realize that might not be the best option. Especially because I essentially can’t touch that money if I were to need it. 

I do have the mortgage, I could put that percentage directly on the principal (our interest rate is 3.0%) 

I would love to put it in an account to earn interest (“let your money make you money”) but I’m not sure if there are any saving accounts that would make it worthwhile.

20,Received a weird scam call today - not sure what they were after?,"Hello, this is a throwaway account by the way. 

Today I received a call pretending to be my electric and gas company. I should have realized it was a scam from the number, but I'm in the process of moving and recently had to change the name on my utility account from my old roommate's name to mine, so I've been answering calls from unknown numbers a little more frequently.

The call was automated at first, saying they were the electric/gas company and that they were calling about shutting off the power or something along those lines, and to press 1 to speak with a representative. Since I literally went through the process of changing the name on the account yesterday (which was a whole thing in itself), I assumed it was just some mix up with that and pressed 1. 

The ""representative"" definitely knew my exact address as I asked them to confirm it twice, and I can't recall if they already knew my name, or if I confirmed it for them...but they definitely know my name now. They were a little had to understand because they had a relatively thick Mexican accent, but that didn't set off any red flags as it wasn't that that thick or unusual really.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure I told them right off the bat that I changed the name on the account the other day and that was what was likely causing this issue. He didn't say much on that, but went to talk to his ""manager,"" and came back saying my account was overdue by $400 and my last payment didn't go through. 

By then, I had my account pulled up on my computer and told him the payment looked like it went through and the next payment was scheduled. He asked for the confirmation number, so I gave him the scheduled payment confirmation number and he went to ""speak with his manager"" again. At this point I should have realized it was a scam, but I was very confused and still thought it was some sort of mix up. 

Anyway, he came back and said that they confirmed the payment was paid but then it was returned to my bank, and I would have to call my bank to deal with it. He went on to say that for the ""overdue"" amount (plus fees for the ""returned payment"", and something else I couldn't really understand) I had to go in person to pay it. I explained how my account online had a $0 balance, and that my bank statement showed a payment to the utility company and no instance of the funds being returned like he said. 

It kinda seemed like we were just going in circles at that point, so I said ""Ok I'll look into it...thanks,"" and I don't think he replied right way (or at all, I can't remember), so I just hung up. I then called the utility company using the number on their website and they confirmed it was likely a scam. 

As far as I can tell, the only possible new information he received is my name, since he clearly already knew my phone number and address (thankfully it was my old/current address and not the one I'm moving to). And since he said I needed to figure out the payment information with my bank and had to pay the overdue amount in person, I'm unclear as to what they were after? In fact, I think he even said I couldn't do a payment over the phone. It seems unlikely that they would be trying to get me to leave my place unattended, as I live in an apartment building, so you'd have to get in through the building door and then into my apartment. 

Is there anything I should be concerned about?

My question is, is it really possible to walk in a bank with almost $0 down (maybe the 10k at most) and get a house of $400/500k value in the promise (to the bank) that the plan is to rent it out to two separate households?

I’m okay with renting the rest of my life but if I could wake up one day and have a house paid off that’d be great.

Curious what sort of hoops I’d have to jump through for a bank to try to make this happen.

On top of all of this, my credit is like 650. Thoughts?",personalfinance,1637286955

23,"Paid-Up whole life insurance, or options?","Hi all, 

I am having a hard time deciding if whole life insurance is a good choice for my dad. My mom recently passed away and the insurance company has offered him a whole life policy for $115k. The package is thin but has some wording about dividend paying but dividends are not expected to be paid. Does anyone have experience in a situation like this? He wants to leave behind no financial burdens when he passes, but I think there may be other options that may be able to help him as well over the next 20+ years. Would it be better to add this amount to a taxable account? Create a living trust? Any ideas of what to look in to would be greatly appreciated!


EDIT: His retirement plans are somewhat fluid still, but here is the general idea that I know: He currently owns a large property in a remote LCOL area. He is debt free and plans to do side jobs and never “fully” retire unless health forces him. His plans now are to get to the point of paying for internet, phone, and electric that is supplemented by solar. Heat is done through a wood boiler system that is renewable with the land he owns. I’m unsure of the exact amounts in retirement accounts, but he is focusing on reducing his monthly bills to the point of being able to afford them working minimally.",personalfinance,1637286819

28,Refinance question,"So we recently refinanced to a new lender (closed at the end of Oct). Within days, we received notice that the new lender had already repackaged our loan and sold it to a new lender. We initially were told we wouldn’t have to make a mortgage payment until Dec; I think the Nov payment was getting added to the principal. Now that it has been repackaged, I’m being told we don’t have to make a payment until January 2022!

Question 1) how do mortgage companies make money repackaging these? 2) Am I getting screwed? 3) What is the wisest course of action?

I thought that perhaps they make money off of people because the natural instinct is to think “Score! No mortgage payment for 1-2 months!” but then the new lender makes more money off of the borrower bc the principal/interest is that much higher.

29,"With January 31st coming rapidly and student loan interest starting again, what is some advice going into this?","General advice is recommended as I bet a lot of people here are going to be in different boats, but fighting the same tidal wave.   
Personally, I'm curious about these:  


Should I try to flatten my higher loans first and get all my loans down to the same amount to lower high interest? Such that if I have a 7k loan and a 2k loan, I should try to get my 7k to match my 2k before tackling the lower one?  


Should I try to consolidate my loans? By January I should have about 9 different loans, but by the time I graduate I will be upwards to around 13... I don't know if I should keep them all separated and pay into each of them, of should I try to create a few mega loans that I can focus on paying against.  


Monthly Bimonthly, Weekly, Biweekly, and Daily payments. I am trying to come up with a strategy to attack my loans and interest, and was wondering the best way to reduce the impact of interest. I have my monthly payment set up to pay a little more than my minimum payment, but came to the realization that since interest accrues DAILY!!!!! I could try to set up a payment daily to mitigate these daily increases. I'm pretty sure at about 5$ a day I can make sure that I'm not acquiring interest, but that also feels like it'll add up super fast. I'm also considering Biweekly payments to tackle the interest plus some, in combination with my monthly minimum plus some.   


Blowing my savings on loan payments. I have been really lucky in having a safety net of having a cheap place to live over the pandemic and have been able to put away a ""decent"" (not really) amount of money into savings. I have not touched this as I was planning on using it to pay back loans as soon as interested started again. I have enough to get rid of 1/4 of all my loans, which though it not a lot, its impactful. But that would be literally ALL my money as my checking's account is pretty sad... I also have an internship that is going to pay handsomely this summer that I'm also planning on throwing at my loans. Is it smart to toss a large chunk of my net worth at loans asap to reduce the long term impact they have on me, or should I just use my savings and summer internship to slowly chip away?

35,Pay off Student Debt by selling house or continue to rent?," Hello All,

I have a fairly unique situation that I need some help working through and advice on. My wife and I currently own two properties-- one that we live in (and airbnb some on the side as we can) and one that we long term rent for $1,650 and a mortgage of $1,050 plus another $100 for other expenses that we cover. We have this mortgage at just around 3% and the renters are reliable and have always paid rent. We have considered two scenarios: 1) turning this house into an Airbnb to make additional income as we have been fairly successful with this in the past and feel that we could average around $2,500-$3,000 a month via airbnb and costs being around $1,500. 2) selling the house to pay off all of our student loans.

The second scenario probably requires some more information. We have about $75K in student loans with two around 5.25% ($33K for 7 years and $19k for 8 years) and one at 7.5% (the remainder of the balance is at 15 years). We know that the house would sell from about $120k more than we purchased it for about four years ago and we could more than pay off our loans and have a decent down payment on another house should one come available and we wanted to continue to Airbnb like we do. Any advice with trying to work this out would be greatly appreciated, but our heads are spinning trying to figure this one out. This very much seems like the age old lump sum vs annuity question, but I need some advice! Thanks a ton!!",personalfinance,1637284726

37,How can I set myself and my family up for maximal stability?,"I'm expecting my first child in December or January. It was an unplanned pregnancy, but we're very excited for him to get here. We just need some help setting our lives up so that our son doesn't want for stability/some level of comfort.  
  
Our current situation: we are living at my family home, owned by my brother. My mom also lives here and isn't a secure person for an infant to be around, so we're looking for other places to rent in the area; we need to stay here for proximity to work and support from my boyfriend's family. 2+ bedroom houses/townhomes/apartments here go for around $1.3–1.4k per month.  
  
I have bad credit because I allowed myself to be pressured into using my credit to support a former partner's lifestyle for three years. I'm in the process of disputing some charges on my credit report that I either made due to coercion or straight-up didn't make. If these disputes fail, I'm looking into filing for bankruptcy. Advice regarding that process is much appreciated; I'm planning on consulting an attorney about it, but all insight is good insight. My boyfriend has no established credit whatsoever.  
  
Due to my credit situation, we might be forced to stay in this unstable living situation for a while, which would at least allow us to save money on rent. We currently make about $50k yearly combined, but my boyfriend is in talks for a salaried position that will earn him $50k yearly alone. That said, we've just returned to our hometown after years of traveling and are building from nothing. My grandma does have $5k put aside for me that she may decide to grant me earlier than she initially planned to. I am about $21k in debt. All of my accounts are closed as of today—does this mean they're no longer accumulating interest? I'm about $5k in credit card debt, $1k in miscellaneous debt (no housing stuff), and owe $15k on a charged-off car loan (I do not have this car anymore).  
  
My boyfriend is a very good salesman and hobbyist mechanic with the mind of an engineer. He does not need schooling to make money, as he's been working since he was 14 and has plenty of experience/a proven track record in a few different industries.  
  
I, however, am not so skilled. I work in a medical office setting and am considering using Pell grants to earn an associate degree in something that will get me more than my current $15/hour. I'm thinking nursing, in particular, but am concerned about the rigorous coursework distracting me from motherhood. If I'm going to do this, I need to start the enrollment process ASAP. Let me know if you think the nurse salary is worth working quite hard for 2+ years (work/school/baby).  
  
My boyfriend's mom is fantastic and has been allowing us to borrow her coupe, but we'll need a sedan once our little dude is here. We can find something cheap that needs a bit of work due to my boyfriend's vehicular know-how. Our budget for this is ~$2k.  
  
Sorry for the somewhat unorganized post. I guess I'm wondering how someone with more financial savvy than me would organize their lives to maximize profit/comfort in the longterm, were they in my position. I know I've made a lot of mistakes in the past and I want to become more self-aware for my son's and boyfriend's sakes.  
  
Not sure how relevant this is, but we're in North Carolina.

This depends on income factors at that time. For that reason I’ll include bonds in my taxable account. I am open to suggestion on keeping it 100% equity on both taxable and Roth IRA accounts.


I have decided to go 100% stocks in my Roth IRA (70% VTI, and 30% VXUS)

Just got my vanguard taxable brokerage account and I’ll be doing the same setup (70% VTI and 30% VSUS) - but I’ll be adding 10-20% bonds. 

My question is how come people talk about 7%, 3% ROI. I understand if people bought bonds from the treasury website before 11/1 that they would get 7% ROI for the first 6 months but then it would probably go down to 3%. 

That makes sense but then I see people talking about how bonds are not making much money recently and are sometimes at 0% or even in the negatives, but some people will still get them to reduce volatility. 

Is this difference from 3% to 0% or even in the negatives a difference in the type of bond or just fluctuations from month to month?

Someone recommended me BND, and to be honest I don’t know much about bonds at all. I’m open to suggestions on what percentage I put (10%-20%) in my taxable account. But as well as I need help understanding these differences in $ gains. 3% and -1% seems like a big difference. 

Better bond then BND? 

This is strictly for my taxable account and possibly my Roth IRA later on down the road. Not trying to use bonds for any part of my emergency savings right now, at least not until I get a better understanding on how they work.

TLDR: how do the different kinds of bonds work? Why dopeople say they get 3% and others say they get in the negatives? 10-20% bonds in my taxable account with vanguard is the range I am probably going to go with.

49,Is there really no alternative to stocks? (the TINA trade),"I am in my 20s with a decent income. I have 12 months emergency funds saved up in a high yield savings account, little debt, I don't have a 401(k) at work but I max out my Roth IRA each year and put all my excess money into my regular investment account.

My portfolio consists of: 60% VTI (total US stock market etf) / 40% VXUS (total international stock market etf). In other words, I am 100% in stocks. This is because I don't see any good alternatives for my money. There is a term for this: TINA (there is no alternative).

So is there really no alternative to putting your money in stocks? Let's look at some of them:

1. Bonds: Traditionally a long term portfolio would consist of a mixture of stocks and bonds. But with interest rates so low and only poised to go up, bonds seem like a bad deal. As someone young and is looking for growth anyway, I probably wouldn't go for more than 10% at this point which wouldn't affect my portfolio much.
2. REITs: Real estate investment trusts. These are more like a class of stocks that invest in real estate and have special rules that most of their money must be paid out to the shareholders. I already own some of these as part of my index funds so I don't really see a reason to go overweight in this sector. If you backtest REITs vs the broader stock market, the broader stock market has outperformed historically anyway.
3. Actual real estate: This would be actually buying and running properties. Way too capital and work intensive. I dont' want a second job so I'm looking for passive income. If I was to get involved in this sector it would likely be through REITs.
4. CDs / Savings accounts: Interest rates are too low right now to keep anything other than an emergency fund in the bank.
5. Precious metals: Precious metals have historically been poor investments. Even as inflation hedges they have been sub-par compared to stocks. Buying physical metals is a pain to store them and you pay high fees when buying or selling.
6. Cryptocurrencies / NFTs: I am not a crypto believer. At best they seem like digital gold (see above for why gold is not a good investment) and at worst they are a ponzi scheme. The fact that they are gaining 500% per year seems like speculative mania. And NFTs seems like more digital fugazi.
7. Alternative investments: There are sites that will let you invest in wine, sites that let you invest in art, sites that let you buy personal debt from people, sites that let you invest early in starts ups and all sorts of niche investments. All these seem to have one or more of the following properties: high fees, high risk, long lock up times on your investment.

So, are there really no alternatives to my current strategy of putting all my money into stock market index funds? I'm not too concerned about a crash or volatility due to my age and income. Despite the diversification I get from owning basically every publicly traded company on the planet, it feels a bit un-diversified to put all my eggs into the basket of stocks. Especially when there are a lot of articles coming out saying how the stock market is overvalued and low interest rates have pushed it to a bubble, etc. But I can't think of any other good investments.",personalfinance,1637283215

54,401(k) with 10% match no limit - when to stop?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve read through the wiki, and it seems like I should be contributing to my employer matched 401k until I at least hit the limit/max of their match. However, my employer has a match at 10% with no limit. It IS on a vested timeline, but at this point in my career I’m 100% vested.

Assuming I can save a large chunk of my income per year, should I be trying to max out the annual 401k limit of ~$20,000 before I put any money into other savings? If I don’t plan on/for whatever reason can’t hit this annual limit, when should I stop and focus savings elsewhere?

Here’s what I’m currently working with, in order of what I contributed the most towards this year:

HSA (don’t normally max this out but I did this year for the first time) I don’t plan on actually pulling from it again but I maxed it out to pay for the birth of my second child

401(k) with 10% company match, no limit on employer side

Mutual funds (currently used for overall large purchase savings (wedding, house, etc)

Roth IRA 

529 (college savings for kids)

Individual stocks/crypto, etc: I try to throw whatever extra cash (if any) here. 

How would you recommend moving things around? What percentage of my income should roughly go to each of these categories? Other info that may be helpful - I’m in my early 30s. Northeast USA.

57,Employer Mistakenly Contributed Her Elections to My 401K in Addition to Mine!,"I work for a small business and a few days ago, the owner of my business let me know that she had set up the auto debit (or whatever it’s called) for my 401K incorrectly. Due to her mistake, she’s been contributing both her elections and my elections to my 401K for the entire year!She and the company that manages the 401k only realized the error when I exceeded my maximum contributions this month. 

Now, before you say anything, I know I should have been paying closer attention to my account, but I have had a trying year and honestly don’t think much of those types of investments. Kind of a set in and forget it. 

Regardless, she and the company initially said they would figure out a fix (which they still may), but today their office administrator called to suggest I hire a CPA to see “if an excess removal would be the right fit for this”. I told her in no uncertain terms that this was not my error and I would not be spending any money to fix it, including hiring a CPA. I do think the company owner will try to do the right thing (ie pay for any accountants ect.) especially as it’s her money in my account. 

But now, I’m concerned about how this may affect me, my account and my taxes. It’s such a weird situation I can’t find anything about it online. So I am really in need of some help! Does any one have any advice as to what I should do, what I should ask my employer for, or what I should be aware of as this proceeds? Any help at all would be SO appreciated!

67,Advice on how to pay off my student loan debt?,"Hello everyone! Would love some advice on how to pay off my student loan. Before I say anything, I acknowledge I am in a very fortunate position right now financially. I still however wish to figure out the best approach to paying off my student loan in a timely manner. 

I am a recent college grad and have been working full-time at a tech company for a year now. So far, I have paid $40,000 of my student loan that is all under my mother’s name. This money came from this year’s salary as well as recent software internships. 

I was able to take advantage of the pause on student loan interest and cut down a decent chunk of my loan, but interest continues January 2022. My mom has $160,000 of my student loan remaining under her name, and both of my parents do not plan on helping me pay off student loan debt. I knew this when I enrolled in my university. 

Given that this loan is on my mom’s credit report, I wish to pay this loan off as soon as possible.

For context on my finances, my annual salary is $170,000, and this January I will have around $100,000 in vested stock (not long term investments, they will vest in January). Every year, assuming the stock price stays stagnant, $100,000 more in stocks will vest and be available to me. Yearly, I spend around $24,000-$30,000 on bills (rent, electricity, water, car lease, insurance). 

Without the vested stocks, I have been making monthly payments of $3000 towards my loan. I would like to know if I should leverage my vested stocks soon to pay off this debt fast, wait until the stocks are deemed long term investments and then pay off part of the loan, or just continue to pay my loan out of pocket with my annual pay. There might even be a different option I haven’t thought of yet. Would love to hear some thoughts though so I can free my mom of this loan.",personalfinance,1637280038

70,Struggling w/ High Monthly Expenses,"Hey all. I am 33 male. married, and no kids. Current annual income (just me) is a tad over 100k but are struggling to make month-to-month expenses. Let me explain.

Got married 3 years ago and moved to Southern California to live with my wife. New job pays okay and is stable \~100k. Got into purchasing a house starting in 2019 but as you all know housing price is crazy here in SoCal. Wife's family is better off so they came up with the down payment ( 60%) and I agreed to take the rest in loan and pay all monthly expenses as my ""contribution"".  My wife and I do not pool our finances together and she has a job that pays very well. We moved in fall of 2019.

Here is how monthly breaks down: Fixed Housing Expenses: $5,600 (Mortage+T&amp;I $4600, utilities plus other housing bills (internet, yard maintenance)  $800). Other Fixed Expenses: phone bill, car insurance, etc $300. Extra Income: rental of guest house $1,700.

The rental income certainly helps but there are months of gaps where there is zero income between different tenants. There are obviously other expenses like food, gas, and other basics, plus the occasional entertainment, purchases, and other housing/personal expenses so I am running razor-thin margins every month. Luckily I don't have any reoccurring debts other than the mortgage and my car (older) is already paid off. I have already done my homework and optimized/reduced all my expenses.

I am running a side hustle to help improve but none have materialized yet. I am making good 401k contributions and some ROTH but not actively investing. As you can conclude by now, I have no savings, there is a little bit of cushion maybe 1-2 months' expenses in our common account but wasn't from my salary savings. I have HSA accounts and have good health insurance, healthy and no medical issues.

Tips on how I could break the cycle? Obviously, I can ask the wife to contribute but it wasn't the original agreement.  With my full-time job there is limited time for my side hustle would be a long-term strategy.",personalfinance,1637279454

72,Bank of America credit card applied in my name by someone else. Please advise,"A few weeks ago, I got a notification from CreditKarma that Bank of America tried (and failed) to do a hard pull on my credit. (I had previously frozen it at all 3 agencies since I wasn't making any new credit applications). I called Bank of America and they told me over the phone that there was a new pending application for a customized rewards credit card and that they would investigate it after I said I did not initiate it.

I followed all the steps in the Identity Theft guide in this sub (thanks!) except the part about filing an identity theft affidavit and a police report (since I wasn't sure if this constituted identity theft).

I called Bank of America a week later and they told me they don't really send the results of their investigations to the customer and that all that the customer service agent could see was that there were no new credit cards on my account (other than the one I already had, which they confirmed the last 4 digits of). They could only say that there is nothing more that BoFa can say, and to dispute with the credit agencies if there were any new accounts or lines of credit being reported on my credit report. 

So far there is no suspicious activity on my credit reports. My questions, if anyone can help me, are:

1) Does this qualify as identity theft? (Someone tried and failed to open a credit card in my name)

2) Would filing an identity theft affidavit and a police report be appropriate for this? (I don't have a written report from BoFa or any proof of suspicious activity other than the email from Credit Karma)

3) Would filing an identity theft affidavit affect my chances of getting a home loan a year or so from now or will it increase the home loan rates?

4) Does this failed attempt to create an account in my name mean that this is likely to keep happening? Would I have to be always on the look out for something like this or is there something I can do to be less of a target? (other than the steps in the Identity Theft wiki, which I've already done). For instance, is it possible to change my SSN or something? What are the consequences of that if I apply for a loan?

I will need to do several cancer testing and screening in the next few months for the lump in my neck (thyroid cancer, family history). So I will probably need to meet some specialists to get it diagnosed.

Not sure how it will turn out, but if something’s wrong, I will need to go through even more testings and treatment. But it could also be nothing and the lump isn’t cancerous.

2. UHC traditional PPO (non HSA)  
3. UHC EPO  
2. Kaiser HSA  
3. Kaiser HMO

75,Help us choose between PPO vs HDHP. Planning for pregnancy.,"Hi all, I need your help in deciding which insurance to pick during the enrollment for 2022. We are currently on a HDHP with HSA plan. Wife and I would try for pregnancy next year, so should factor in OB/GYN visits. I have used the insurance calculator, but I'm having difficulty to come to a conclusion due to our specific needs. 
Our company has two HDHP - Value Saver and Premier. We are on Premier HDHP as it has somewhat low deductible and out of pocket max.

Premier HDHP with HSA
- Monthly premium $165
- Employer contribution to HSA $400
- Combined medical and pharmacy family deductible  $3350
- Out of pocket max family $5000
- Coinsurance 10%
- Specialty pharmacy 50% ($100 min $250 max)

PPO
- Monthly premium $194
- Medical family deductible $1275
- Medical Out of pocket max family $6000
- Pharmacy family deductible $300
- Pharmacy Out of pocket max family $4000
- Coinsurance 10%
- Copay Specialist visit $50
- Copay PCP $30
- Specialty pharmacy 50% ($100 min $250 max)

I have a chronic condition and recently put on a medication and need specialty medication refill every month which costs around $4000. I have a coupon card which would cover almost everything and also counts towards the deductible. Also I use a CPAP which needs regular replacement of supplies every quarter. We are worried that it would be very expensive if we need to go to a doctor for medical needs in the month of Jan before I meet my deductible. For PPO,  we have to meet $1275 for medical expenses and a separate deductible for pharmacy. If we go for HDHP we would most probably avoid deductible and have to pay coinsurance. If we go for PPO we cannot avoid not paying for deductible. Am I thinking right? How should I weigh my options here? Please help me guide here. Appreciate any help!",personalfinance,1637278956

94,Check my math on ROI from buying Treasury I Bonds?,"So I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about Treasury I Bonds and when I did the math regarding potential interest earnings, it doesn't seem all that good of an investment. 

Here is the scenario: 

I Bonds report a composite interest rate, which from Nov 2021 to Apr 2022 is 7.12% given the bonds were purchased in that period. The interest is compounded at the end of the 6 month period.

Suppose I buy $10,000 worth of bonds in Nov 2021 and another $10,000 in Jan 2021. Right now let's just calculate the interest as of Apr 2022, not too worried about after that. 

So the first $10k will be eligible for interest for 5 months (Dec to Apr), which would be:

0.01 * 7.12 * 10,000 * 5 /12 = $296.66

The second $10k would be eligible for 3 months (Feb - Apr), which would be:

0.01 * 7.12 * 10,000 * 3 /12 = $178

So, I know I couldn't touch this money for a while, but around Apr 2022 I should have $178 + $296.66 = $474.66 interest accrued. Is this correct?

Much appreciated if you read this far, thank you. 

The reason this doesn't seem to be as good an investment is because looking at the history of interest rates, 7% is a very high marker. It can't continue too long. If I'm gonna invest this money for 5 years and only make 10% total at the end of that, to me that's not worth it.",personalfinance,1637275631
95,How to leverage no buying agent when buying a home,"My SO and I have found a house that has yet to hit the market through a mutual friend. The sellers are an affluent elderly couple moving to a retirement home and have already signed a contract with a selling agent but no staging/listing or anything has been done on the house yet. 

We met with the sellers and toured the house and would like to buy. We seemed to form a connection and they have essentially said they would like to sell the house to us for asking price. The housing market is very hot here currently and their agent has told both of us that if the house goes to market, it will go for well over asking price. Two comps in the area recently did the same. The sellers would still like to move forward with us. I believe everyone is acting in good faith. The seller has expressed how stressful their current move is, so while we do not have any leverage with respect to the price of the house, we can offer them flexibility regarding move out dates and leaving furniture behind.

I have done some reading about the buying/selling agent split and how it comes out of the seller cut. Since we found the property ourselves and have not signed an agreement with the buying agent that has showed us a couple other houses, we are going to represent ourselves and use a real estate attorney to look over the docs for us. 

My question is, what is the best way to ask for the price to be lowered by whatever the cut of the buying agent would be (3%?)? Essentially so that the seller and sellers agent both get the same amount as if we had an agent taking a commission and had bought the house for list price.",personalfinance,1637275437

97,"401(K) rollover check never cashed, two years later, what are my next steps?","Hi all,

In January of 2019 I changed employment. In June of 2019 I attempted to rollover my previous 401(k) to my new company's 401(k) provider. However, the rollover check was made out incorrectly so the new admin could not cash it. Due to stress, confusion, and me just being dumb, I just left it at that point. 

Fast forward to now, I am back with my original company, but they have since switched 401(k) administrators. When I contact my HR, they tell me to contact the new admin. When I contact the new admin, they tell me to contact the old admin, since they sent the check. When I call the old admin, they say since the new admin took over, they should now have all the history, and can't seem to find any info.

3,Picking between two good jobs,"I currently work at a great company, but recently got another offer that is just as good. I’m trying to weigh both the pros and cons, but any advice/thoughts would be great. 

Job 1: This is a start up that currently offers 10% less than what the second job has offered. However after talking to my boss about this they said they have a pretty good chance of matching that pay come annual raises. If not he will personally recommend me jobs. This job is relaxed, but challenges me in skills I enjoy using—however I don’t see myself being fulfilled long term in this position. This job does set me up to a lot of different opportunities if/when I decide to leave. The hardest thing to say goodbye to is the unlimited PTO and references from this job. 

Job 2: Offers 10% more and offered to fully paying for my masters since it working for a university. It is also very relaxed with two days out of the week being WFH, but the problem with this job is it seems very limiting in opportunities if I decide to leave.

4,Guidance Needed Regarding Sale of home / Details of Trust Not Followed by Trustee,"Hello! I am using a throwaway account as I don't want this question linked to my regular account as it includes personal finance info and a little family drama sprinkled in, i hope that is acceptable. Warning, this is long...

My son 3 years old and has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder 1. The healthcare and resources in my current state (US Southwest) are very poor  quality and my wife and I decided a few months back that we plan to move back to the East Coast for better health support and to be closer to friends/family in the next 2-5 years. This time table moved up when we were approached by a realtor that specializes in horse  property who said if we listed our house now we could potentially get top dollar and to sell before the sellers market cools further. 

Here are some of the details:

\-  Current home purchased for 580k in March of 2020. It is currently on  the market for  949k. Our current mortgage is paid off thanks to the sale of previous home and some other assets so we are looking  to profit nicely from the sale of this house. 2 year ownership mark is coming up in March 2022.

\-  I am the beneficiary of a trust and am in the process of rolling it over (through Vanguard). Trust  valued at $718,584 (as of 10/31). 

\-Half of the assets in the trust were supposed to be given to me when I turned 30, but that did not happen. My father, the trustee, did not let me know of this when I turned 30. I am now 35 and had to request control and info regarding the trust and then found that when I turned 35 it was supposed to be completely turned over to me. I turned 35 five months ago and am just now finding this out. 

\-Currently 99.1% of the Vanguard account is in stocks, the other .9% is listed as  ""other.""

\-I have a Roth IRA  valued at around 70k in my name that I recently found out about too. I am working to get that fully turned over to control myself. 

\-I currently have a 401k, 4% contributions which is worth approx $18,532.

\-I  receive quarterly dividend payments of 25% as I was also trusted shares in my family's company when one of the founders passed away many years ago. These dividend payments vary based  on company performance. My wife and I have regular jobs so we used the first few payments to pay off student loans and our cars, now the majority of this dividend is saved to pay the associated quarterly tax vouchers. 

\-Various savings bonds from my grandfather in my name that I do not have in hand but will have hopefully by December. Will wait for full maturity before depositing. 

\-Both family cars are paid off. No student loans. We have no outstanding debt other than credit cards which we ensure to keep under the $5000 mark and make regular  payments. 

Questions:

1. Do we have any legal clout against my father for not following the details of the trust? I don't plan to do anything unless he decides to pull something like not rolling over control of the Vanguard account. 

2. What would be the recommended actions to ensure we are setting up our son future for success? We are in touch with a lawyer that specializes in Special Needs cases so we need to be very careful about how we set  up things for my son as it can make him ineligible for certain resources if he  has too much to his name. 

3. How bad of a tax penalty will we receive if we sell our current home prior to owning it over the 2 year mark? I understand I may be able to request an eligibility based on the fact we are moving to provide better medical care for my son. 

4.  If we set a closing date past the two year mark in March, would that be the best course of action?

5. Once the trust rolls over to my own Vanguard account, will I be taxed for the rollover or only if I sell stocks to withdraw money?

7. Do I need to wait a year after time of taking control of Vanguard account before I sell stocks in order to prove long term ownership?

8. I want to use some of the money from my trust to cover moving costs and give us a buffer until we are settled in our new location, what is the best way to do this without being penalized too heavily tax wise?

9. Should I keep the funds in Vanguard and let the stocks do their jobs or liquidate and invest in something else or throw it in a savings account?   

Sorry for all the questions. This was all dumped on me in the past week and I am trying to keep my head above water understanding the process and hoping to make sound decisions. Any info is appreciated!",personalfinance,1637274216
5,"You just received a windfall, your life is forever changed","DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional nor do I claim to be, I'm just looking to impart some of my personal experience and advice in hopes that it reaches someone that's going through a similar situation. If you're a financial wizard a lot of this is common knowledge - this is aimed at people that aren't as financially literate, but are forced to be after a windfall.

Some time ago my net worth multiplied 15x overnight. Like most of us on this sub would have done, I read every article out there to try and prepare and asked around to gain as much knowledge as possible. 

Looking back on it, while these articles were very helpful and covered the straight up financial topics such as paying off debts, diversified portfolio, and more, very thoroughly, they fail to capture a lot of realities of the situation. The natural human dilemmas that arise after someone's net worth multiples is complicated to say the least. 

While finances are already challenging, add in human wants, needs, and emotions and you have a recipe for disaster, or success... 

Below is my account and advice on how to deal with a windfall and reason your way to a more disciplined mindset that will strike a balance between fiscal responsibility and your wants and needs, so you don't burn through your windfall faster than a gas soaked tinder box. 

Tl;dr - Don't be stupid with a windfall, we get it, here's some alternate advice for the more real, human side of handling a windfall

**Your life will change**

I don't care if you follow every rule out there or don't touch that money a single bit until the day you die - your outlook on money will be influenced by the windfall and as a result your life has been changed. If anyone ever tells you it ""doesn't have to change your life"" or ""just keep doing what you're doing"" they either have..

A) Meticulously built their net worth over time and don't realize that most people with windfalls are        financially illiterate and are not prepared with the skills to deal with it or..

B) Is someone that does not have a lot of net worth and is reiterating talking points they've read somewhere in a book or on reddit.

It's OK that your life is changing - take a deep breath. Through time invested and a disciplined mindset, it will be for the better. 

**Be curious**

Recognizing *how* your outlook on money, life, where your time is spent, your job, spending habits, relationships, etc.. **has changed and is changing** is the first step to getting a grip on your new future. It is a lot to handle at first.. *Do I still need to keep working this dead end job? Maybe I should go back to college and pursue a career that pays less, but is way more interesting..  Do I want to fly across the country to see my family more often? Should I pay down my house and car? Why am I spending more frivolously, should I? Can I retire now, should I? Can I start investing in real estate, how do I even do that?*

Indulge yourself, be curious, ask those questions! You won't be able to set goals until you begin asking   yourself all those questions. Eventually you'll want to narrow down your questions and start finding answers to them. Whether it's simpler questions, such as..

* Should I pay off the rest of my car loan?
* Do I need a financial advisor?
* Can I afford another car?

Or some that are more in depth, such as...

* What can I expect my life to look like if I live off of my inheritance and quit my job?
* How should I diversify my portfolio?

Getting advice from others will help uncover the shroud of mystery and give you a clearer view of what it would look like to commit each of these endeavors.

Read around, post anonymously, be humble, and don't be afraid to ask dumb questions - every single one of us at one point had our diapers changed and was financially illiterate.

In terms of ""don't tell anyone you won the lottery"", ""everyone's lives that inherits a lot of money goes down the drain, it's statistically proven"", "" - I have found this to be untrue and quite the opposite. While $1M is no $20M from a lottery, it is definitely enough to get the in laws heads turning your way. With that being said, confiding in loved ones, close friends, an Aunt or Uncle about your situation can be helpful and reduce the psychological burden and guilt that some might experience after a large inheritance.

If they ask for details, you have 0 obligation to tell them anything, and can politely decline. If they continue to pry, congratulations, you've found someone that you'll now be sure to keep your distance from going forward.

Tl;dr - Indulge your thoughts, read up, talk to people you *trust*, figure out what really matters to you.

**First things first...**

At the end of the day, it is **your money**, you choose exactly what to do with it. With that being said, I do believe there are some minimum, across the board activities that everyone should do. *Note: It takes about 3 months for everything to transfer over. This includes creating new accounts or converting accounts with the banks, instilling the stepped up cost basis, transfer of title, signing papers, lawyers, etc...*

* Nothing rash - no major purchases (lamborghini, hermes handbags, houses, sailboats etc...) within the first year. Let the dust settle.
* Pay off any debts with big IRs - this does not include your home or your car, unless your car IR is something stupid high or if your conv. mortgage is over 4-5% you should look into refinancing regardless of this windfall.
* Don't quit your job right off the bat (this would be a rash decision) - even if the windfall is all in bonds and generating more income than you already make.

It's been 8 months since you've inherited the windfall and you've paid off a CC debt and withdrawn $15k for an emergency fund (don't forget if you've sold stock you need to pay taxes on that!), you've asked yourself THOUSANDS of questions and been through countless situations. You think you have a grasp on some purchases you might want to make, what *now?*

**Understand how far your money will** ***actually*** **go**

At first $1,000,000 might seem like a lot and that all your problems are solved and goals will be fulfilled.. *We can go buy a $750k home instead of that $350k we were looking at! College is paid for the 2 kids we want to have! Screw that 5 year old civic, I'm selling that cheap and quick and getting a brand spanking Lexus! I'm going to quit my job and live off my inheritance!*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* Buying a $750k home - 25% down payment is $187.5k cash | say you need to sell all of that in stock after 1 year of inheriting the money - 15% \* $37.5k in profits = $5.6k | $25k in closing costs | $2,900 monthly payments = $34.8k yearly

That nifty 4bd 3ba with a swimming pool and hot tub after just one year will cost you roughly $252.9k, reducing your windfall by **25%.** $35k every following year as well..

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* 18 years later your set of twins are ready to head off to a good out of state college. You haven't touched *a dime* of your inheritance. Your money has accrued at a darn solid rate of 8% yearly, that $1M is now $4M | 2 kids \* 4 years \* $72k (adjusted 5% college tuition over 18 years from 30k now)= $576k | taxes on all that nice stock: 15% \* $576k = $86.4k

Your children will now have a better chance at a salaried job in this world at the cost of $662.4k, reducing your future windfall value by **16.5%.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* Sell that clunky civic for +$14k | buy a nice $55k Lexus with those ass toaster seats | tax on that $41k \*15% = $6k

That new car to show up all the other soccer moms just cost you $47k and **4%** of your windfall.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* You quit your $70k salary job and move all your $1M into bonds to generate a yearly income of roughly $85k.

That trade off will only grow your inheritance by about 2-3% yearly while a S&amp;P500 index would grow about 8% yearly. By quitting your job and shifting your investing strategy, after only 10 years you would be missing out on **\~$7M.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Life is expensive; some things more than others. If you aren't financially literate enough to cost out large purchases and situations like the ones above, I would **highly** recommend reading up enough until you feel comfortable doing this.

Understanding what that $$ would have done had you leave it untouched is just as much as part of costing out what the cost of the home, boat, car will be upfront. It will greatly help you grasp what any of your future endeavors will realistically cost in the long run.

$1,000,000 is not nothing, but it's also not as much as you think.

**Setting goals and limits**

With your newly acquired knowledge of how to do some basic financial analysis and some soul searching in terms of whether that job is really worth it or to take that second flight to see friends and loved ones, now's the time to **set some goals and create a plan.**

With these skills you should be able to set short and long term goals, while not reducing your windfall, and depending how you do it, even grow that fund. Some examples of limits and goals:

* Do not with draw more than 4% of the fund every year - half of the 4% can be spent frivolously while the other 2% must be saved or put toward an appreciating asset (home downpayment, business, etc...)
* In 20 years - have enough to purchase 2 separate vacation homes and maintain based off of 1% withdrawl from fund.
* Withdraw 5% yearly to invest in your real estate venture.
* Don't touch a dime of it for the next 20 years, then live off of 4% yearly withdrawls. 

**Action or Inaction**

By this time you should have thoroughly vetted yourself for what matters to you and what you want to do. You've looked at the cost analysis and are comfortable spending that money. You know it won't eat away at your windfall too much and it will make itself up over the next few years. It's been over a year - so why not go buy that boat, car, or home?..

If there's anything I want the reader to get out of this part, is that inaction is just as fine as action. **Just because you have the time and money to make a purchase or do something, doesn't mean you should.** It is more than fine letting the money sit and do it's thing. That windfall is opportunity, but it is entirely up to you to capitalize on in when and how.

Dealing with a windfall is a long ever changing journey, but over time I promise the path gets clearer. Stick with it and be confident in your choices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - A lot of articles downplay the windfall situation, dealing with a windfall creates opportunity to change your life, here are some methods for how to deal with the opportunity and be confident in your decisions

12,Need help with this car related finance decision,"I made a mistake of taking a chance and driving through a puddle (from the crazy heavy rainfall the past few days) that didn't look deep to me, then the engine was hydro-locked.

I was offered the options :

1. Rebuild the engine (not going to because I don't like rebuilt title and it doesn't cost any less)
2. Swapping the engine with a used one. I hope a used Mazda 3 engine but 2014 or newer could give my car a new life even tho I can't change the mileage on the dashboard which is currently already at 140k km. The mechanic can find a used engine with around 60 km mileage, but the cost would be C$4000 plus tax ($2000 for the block, installation for labor 1800, fluids 200)

The insurance deductible is $1000 and will make my monthly payment go up for the next few years, the total will be about the same according to my insurance broker. I'm currently waiting for the insurance company to get back to me, they need to look at the car and let me know a repair cost or if it'll be a write-off.

I am leaning towards getting a used engine because I like this car and thought this would cost less in the long run because a lower mileage engine means longer life from the car, maybe? I bought my car in 2019 Jan with $9000 cash, it had 90k mileage.

Please advise what I should do as this is a lot of money to me, and anything I should take into consideration. I really like Mazda 3 and want to keep driving it until it gets to a point where the maintenance gets too expensive.

Up until now I've gone with our PPO option, but I know an HSA is highly recommend if that is an option, but depends on a lot of parameters. I think I know what our best option is, but I wanted to get a second opinion (or third, or fourth) before making the final decision just to see if there is something I'm not consider.

Here are some of our details:

Married, 36M and 36F, no kids and no plans for them. We have a fully funded $20K emergency fund now covering at least 6 months expenses, if not more. We are already both utilizing our employer matches into our 401k or equivalent. Also currently funding as much as we can afford in IRAs.

We own a home worth roughly 280K with 140K mortgage.

We have been married 5 years and haven't yet had a large medical expense during this time. My wife is overweight and had two hip surgeries before we were married and has some chronic pains as a result, but nothing that has been very serious. Neither one of us is currently on any prescriptions. So there are some health concerns there that could cause us to reach our deductible or max out our annual maximum, but it seems we are still likely young enough and have minor enough issues that this would be a slam dunk decision.

Here is where the decision gets tough. The comparison of the two healthcare choices. Both offer 100% coverage of preventive care and hearing/eye exams. Here are the differences:

**PPO**

Most standard visits are copays ranging from $15 for walk-in clinics to $50 for MRI and CT scans. Emergency room is $100 for in- or out-of-network. Prescriptions have tiers of $0/10/30/75 copay based on how generic / name brand they are.

In-Network Deductible: $100/person

Out-of-network Deductibe: $600/person

After deductible most coverage is 100% except for ambulance (80%), prosthetics (80%), and out-of-network care (70%).

Annual Maximum: $2500/person, $4000/family

Seems like it would be unlikely for us to ever spend more than $1200 in a year at this stage of our lives.

Cost: $158.58 biweekly = $4123 annually

**HDHP+HSA**

Pretty much everything listed above is 90% coverage after deductible is met, including prescriptions. Only exception is out-of-network care (70%).

In-Network / Out-Of-Network Deductible: $1500 for me, $3000 for family (so my wife's deductible would be $3000, at which point we would both reach our deductible for the year)

Annual Maximum: $3000 for me, $6000 for family (same breakdown as above)

Employer Contribution to HSA: $1500 annual

Cost: $141.69 biweekly = $3684 annually

&amp;#x200B;

So the premium savings for the HDHP are only about $440 annually, plus the $1500 annual contribution to the HSA. I would plan to fully max out my HSA every year.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this worth it? I think it still is, but I'm not sure if there are any other considerations I'm forgetting. It seems like we'd ever go much past $3000 a year, and even that is only moderately likely. My wife is more likely than I am over the next 5-10 to require anything major, and her deductible is higher, but it's still only $3000. And we would need to rack up an additional $30,000 in medical expenses by my wife to hit our annual maximum.

Thanks for any advice!",personalfinance,1637273084
16,Trading my 2020 Civic Lease to finance a 2007 Prius for Doordash,"I'm 18, in my first year of college. About a year ago I decided to lease a Honda Civic for 36 months at $180 per month (24 months left). I used to work a part time job at my local grocery store, but now that I am in college I really can't do the whole ""locked in"" schedule and I much rather prefer the flexibility of Doordash (it's also 100x easier).

The problem here is that I have limited miles because of the lease, and I don't intend on buying it out at the end meaning I would have to pay for the extra mileage. This EATS into my profits because I estimate to drive about 30k-40k miles per year which would cost me around $7k-$10k in extra mileage. Another thing is the gas mileage on my car isn't excellent so I pay a lot for gas too.

A Prius, on the other hand, has double my current gas mileage and if financed would allow unlimited/free miles. I saw a used one on craigslist for $6k and it is 2007 with 133,000 miles. With $1,500 down-payment it would leave me with $200 for 24 months which is essentially the same that I pay for my current car. Obviously I would be losing a LOT of technology, features, as well as the look, reliability, and free maintenance of my lease. But with the added benefits of unlimited/free miles, half the price of gas, and full long-term ownership.

My question is; is it worth it? I have a friend ready to take over my lease, but I'm still thinking it over. Losing all of the benefits of a new car in order to increase my income by 50/80%. I also don't intend on keeping either car after I graduate.",personalfinance,1637272978

The move was initiated by me and it was for personal reasons, mostly. When my boss informed me that my transfer went through, I got an email with my new assignment. The assignment stated that I would be working in a ‘Field’ position. When I arrived, my new boss informed me that there is far too much ‘Office’ work to do, which is 99% work that should be hers but she hasn’t gotten to in a matter of years, and that I would be helping out in the office until further notice. 

I absolutely hate it here because of this ‘Office’ role and I’m actively looking for other opportunities at different companies. As a part of the move, I received a $5000 bonus, which I’m supposed to return if I leave before 6 months after the move.

# Personal Background

25, graduated college Fall 2019, working as a Software Engineer since early 2020. Living in the Denver metro area, but permanently working from home. 

# Income

I'm currently the sole income, though my partner is actively looking for a job (engineering).

I work as a Software Engineer, ~140k salary. 

# Savings

I contribute the maximum to my employer-sponsored 401k ($19,500 in 2021). I also contribute the maximum to my employer-sponsored HSA. Between this 401k and the Traditional IRA I rolled over from my last job, I have ~40k saved for retirement.

I have ~20k in cash savings, which is what I'm comfortable with. I could probably choose to hold less money in cash given stability in my field of employment, but I don't like feeling unprepared.

# Car situation

I sold my beater car last year when I moved in with my partner. Since then, my partner has generously shared their car with me. It is a 2002 Toyota Camry with ~150k miles driven. This car is ""good enough"" for us, because neither of us commutes for work, or has any plans to commute in the future. The Camry gets about 18mpg for the type of urban/suburban driving we typically do, but it gets 22mpg on long highway trips. We drive approx. 500 miles in a month, for a gas cost of ~$90.

The best part of this situation (for me) is that I don't currently pay for car insurance, as the car title is in their name only.

I'm not looking for an excuse to buy a brand-new Tesla just to save $90/mo on gas. Instead, I'm interested in buying the cheapest used EV I can find that has the range and safety features I care about. 

As far as I can tell, I will be eligible for the following EV tax credits if I buy an EV or plug-in hybrid:

**Federal incentive**: $7,500

**CO State incentive**: $5,000

Given these incentives, if I can find a suitable used car for $22-25k, would it be completely unreasonable to buy it? It seems like I'm in a place where I could put down $5,000, take out a loan for the rest, and then pay the balance of the loan early.

52,Landlord selling SoCal duplex. Does it make sense to invest in a beach property or walk away and purchase first home?,"My landlord recently informed me that she is interested in selling the duplex of which I reside in one unit. She’s not doing this to get out of being a landlord but is looking to reinvest in another property in the area as evidenced by her stating that she is concerned with the feasibility of a 1031 transfer. She is looking to list next month and is hoping to close by January 2022 depending on whether she can find another property to invest in. I can leverage that she knows me, that I know the property and that selling outside of me comes with risks (contingencies can get messy).

This has put me into the situation where I’m sort of forced into purchasing my first home. Comparable or even lesser rentals at a new property would increase my rent near the levels of a mortgage payment. She seems open to the idea of potentially selling me the duplex but I’m hoping to get some insight here.  

So I am looking at two options: I can either purchase my first home in another less appealing area but not worry about things that come with being a landlord and the affordability an expensive property. Or I can purchase this duplex and invest in an area that appreciation is likely and depreciation is very unlikely in that I’m in a very known and desirable beach community in SoCal. I love my current neighborhood. 

The SoCal housing market is insane right now. But I've started talking to brokers about each option and have received some very appealing quotes on both options. 

**Option 1: Purchase investment duplex**  

* 
Cost: Estimated ~1.1M/~5700mo payment @2.427% APR  
* Potential Rental Income:2400-2600 monthly  
* Area: Highly desirable SoCal Beach community, extremely walkable. Schools are good. 
* Positives: Potential appreciation could be very high, depreciation is less likely the nearer you are to the beach (investment??). Save money on purchase by avoiding realtors and misc fees.  
* Negatives: Would be dependent on rental income to make the mortgage payment, smaller units would likely impact future family planning. Would need some improvements and repairs in order to be able to pull what I’d need in rent to afford.  

I’ll also look into getting my own appraisal to ensure that the price is fair.

**Option 2: Purchase a SFH**  

* Cost: ~600K/~3100mo payment @2.558% APR (approx. 27% DTI)  
* Area: More in town  
* Positives: Unattached SFH. Likely turnkey. Lower payment for more house.  
* Negatives: If the market swings/crashes, would I be paying more than I should? Lesser desirable area though it is on an upswing due to flips. Less walkable. Schools are lower quality.

**Concerns:**

* Unrealistic to rent one duplex unit and still not stretch myself on the monthly mortgage?
* Units too small for future family?

**Facts**

* Annual Salary:140K/yr
* 401K: 14% (maxed out yearly contributions)
* Debt: &lt;6K. Car is almost paid off a year early, Zero to low balance on CCs. 
* Additional funds for improvements are potentially available and are around 75K.
* VA Loan Eligible. No Down/No PMI

54,Wife's Company offers NSRP alternative to Social Security beneficent does anyone have experience with this?,"My wife's company as part of their benefit  package offers a NSRP (National Security &amp; Retirement Program) basically you pay into the program rather than paying into the national Social Security. it also includes a substantial contribution match. Im trying to figure out what the downsides are?

&amp;#x200B;

56,Suggestion for those refinancing student loans,"This isn't an ad of any kind. I'm sharing my personal experience as I navigate the world of student loans while also starting the process of getting mortgage for first home purchase.

Quick version of last 30 days:

\- I had 90K in loans with Navient

\- I paid of 20K in a lump sum

\-Immediately refinanced and moved loan from Navient to Earnest

\-Payment dropped from $1,200 per month to $486 per month. (term extended)

Top priority for me was lowering the monthly payment as I plan to pay the balance of my loan in a lump sum 12 months from now. So far the next 12 months, I wanted to pay as little as possible.

Lower payment also helps if we decide to buy a house before we pay off the student loan in full.

I tried Sofi and several other shops for the refinance. None of them approved my Refi. It's possible that my income was too high, and their system realized I was just going to use their lower payments for 1 year and not have the loan for 20 years. 

Anyway a company called Earnest approved me for whatever reason, and the process was extremely simple. If you are having trouble refinancing, I would look to them. Not sure how their underwriting differs. My credit is right at 700 so still not sure why no one else would take my loan. But I had a great experience with Earnest.

63,Need advice - low income and high debt,"Hi all! Just seeking advice from the community regarding my current financial situation. So, I graduated from law school in May 2021. I planned to take a break from working to focus on preparing to take the bar exam in July 2021. I found out in late April 2021 that I was pregnant. At that point, I was finishing my legal Externship and continued to move forward with my original plan to exclusively study for the bar and take the exam in July. 

I had money saved up to cover my bills/expenses until August, at which point I was planning to go back to work. Due to my pregnancy, I was unable to find any steady work until late September. In the meantime, I had learned that I did not pass the July bar and will need to retake it in February. 

My mom and fiancé have helped me out tremendously during this time, as my savings ran out in August. I am now working, but have been unable to pay and get ahold of my credit card bill for a couple of months. I have not used the card since earlier this year, but due to the monthly interest being charged (and now late fees), I owe a whopping $19k to the bank. I called the bank to see if we could work out any payment plan or if they offered payment assistance. The only option provided was to completely close the card and they would try to work out a new payment plan with me. 

As much as I don’t want want to hurt my credit, I’m starting to think this may be my best option. I don’t qualify for a loan/transfer card due to my debt to income ratio. I didn’t mention, but I have $220k in student loan debt that is deferred until February 2022. My current credit score is a 640. 

I am due to give birth next month and will be taking the bar exam approximately 9 weeks postpartum. During this time, I will not be working and the status of my employment will be in the air come February because I only work part-time now with no benefits. This is the first time in my entire life that I have had such financial trouble. Prior to law school, I worked full time and had a 750 credit score.

66,Boss just floated the idea of transitioning me to general manager within a few months; a few questions for you guys,"

Hey everyone,

Disclaimer: I know that I’m going to have to do plenty of my own pondering/budgeting/etc in order to approach this situation the right way, so I’m not looking for some wizard to give me “all of the right answers” here. I’m really just hoping to hear additional opinions/perspectives/etc, because there may be things that I *should* be thinking or considering, but haven’t even thought of yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

Not terribly long ago, I applied for a job at a small liquor store nearby. The owner had been looking to hire someone for a **very** long time, and I was offered the job the day I applied. When I was asked how many hours I was looking for, I said “as many as you can give me,” and when asked what sort of pay I was looking for, I said that I was hoping to start at $13/hour — adding that I’d eventually like to earn more than that. The owner trained me and got me up to approx. 38-40 hours per week pretty quickly. 


I recently had my 90-day evaluation, and long story short: the owner &amp; his wife (who sort of helps runs the place with him) said that they were thrilled with my performance, and that they were giving me a $1 raise. Then they asked me if I had any interest in transitioning — over the course of the next 6 months or so — into a “general manager” position. Basically, the owner wants to be able to pull away from his daily/weekly duties a bit (wants time with family, time to travel, etc). They mentioned that the idea is that I’d be trained to run the day-to-day of the store, to be the one who places orders from distributors, decides what needs to be ordered &amp; when, and essentially “run the store.” 

The conversation was just an introduction to the idea, so we weren’t tossing around official numbers or anything like that — they just wanted to know if I’d even be *interested* in that sort of thing. The next two months will be super busy, but when January comes, things will slow down considerably, and they said that would be the ideal time to sit down again and really talk it over.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway….I haven’t really been in a position like this before — at least, not in an industry even resembling this one — and I’m trying to get a sense of the types of things I should be considering/questions I should plan on asking/etc. 

I googled “average liquor store manager salary Maryland,” and $34,878 came up as a figure. That’s not a great salary, but I’m in a position where I could swing that for 1-2 years without too much hurt. Not sure if I should quote a similar figure if/when asked about pay raise?

I assume I should ask about benefits such as health insurance/etc, but since I’m dealing with a small family-owned business, I don’t know if that’s extreme….like, maybe something that’s more of a “corporate” question? 

I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life, but the combination of the pandemic and some major family events have caused me to start a *significant* industry switch, and I could see me doing this for 2 years or so while I prepare myself for plans further down the road.

I don’t currently pay rent (a living situation I’ve worked out with my brother), so this could perhaps be a good opportunity to build up some savings and invest in training programs for what I’d eventually like to do. 

Long story short: are there things I should be considering that I haven’t really mentioned yet? With a smalll business such as this, is there a “line” (so to speak) that I should try to avoid crossing when inquiring about pay and benefits? 

Sorry if this is scrambled. I’m writing in a hurry before a shift, and I just wanted to get this post out while it’s on my mind. Thanks!",personalfinance,1637264432

I currently have health insurance via BCBS via my employer. I'm planning on leaving my current job at the end of December 2021 to study for the next year or so and live off of savings.

I called BCBS for info on selecting a new insurance plan and they connected me with someone who I believe was an insurance broker. This gentleman told me that since I'm young (36) and live in Texas and don't have any pre-existing conditions, my best option was to sign up for something called a ""multiplan"" PPO health insurance plan outside of the marketplace.

Apparently, this multiplan has costs split between a few different insurance companies which helps it have a lower monthly rate than the plans in the healthcare.gov marketplace. The plan has a $500 deductible and an out of pocket maximum of $2,500. It is described as an 80/20 plan and is considered ""bridge the gap"" coverage until I take another job in roughly 12-18 months.

The insurance company is something called ""Thrive Health"", which I've never heard of, which is obviously concerning.

The broker said for me and my wife (age 39) our total coverage would be $476/month and adding dental, vision, and hearing is an additional $30 bringing the monthly total to $517/month for both of us.

Is this legitimate? Or, am I being taken for a ride, so to speak? And would we be better off just signing up for a plan via the marketplace instead? FWIW: The price for this insurance is much better than we'd be paying going through the marketplace.

On the renewal notice, the new amount is $430,000 which increased every other limit on the policy and caused the premium to go up nearly $800 annually. 

As I understand it, the dwelling limit is the cost to replace your home should it be destroyed. This shouldn't change that much over the value of the home. Maybe the argument that the building materials are more expensive etc. could cause the limits to go up but is it normal for a home ins company to change this automatically on the renewal?

I don't see how it would cost nearly $70k more to rebuild the house when it's the same house even considering increase in inflation and supply costs?

And should I lower this coverage back down to $360,000 or do I run the risk of not being fully covered in this case?

I'm unsure how to price out the Dwelling coverage A limit because I really don't know how much it would cost to rebuild the home.

80,Mentally Ill Mother Financial Issues,"I love my mother, but she is also schizophrenic and a hoarder whose mental health has been declining over the years. Ever since I can remember, she has depended on others for financial help. She is a sweet woman, but she is extremely paranoid of others, always talking about conspiracies people have against her, and hasn’t been on any medication since I was born. My father and her divorced when I was in high school which forced her to begin working again. While I was in college, she lived and worked at a hotel for a while then travelled around the Midwest doing odd jobs. She is quite resourceful when she needs to be. She even has a college degree, but she’s in no mental state to use it anymore. She then lived with my grandparents who took her in once again and it ended horribly with my mother pushing her father down, breaking his hip, and they had to get a restraining order against her. On top of that, she gave them bed bugs because of her hoarding. Once I began my career, I found and co-signed an apartment for her. I was meant to support her for a while until she could find a job and support herself. I spoke with her every week pleading her to job search and she never did. Supporting her spread my finances very thin. Her hoarding and strange habits eventually got her evicted after a year, which almost ruined my credit. I had to appear in civil court to try and fix it. When the pandemic hit, she got on unemployment and lived another hotel for the past year. She still didn’t get a job, granted the car I gave her broke down. She also didn’t reapply for unemployment so when it ran out she though someone was taking money out of her account. The hotel kicked her out a couple of weeks ago for collecting cans around the property and storing them in her car. I now live across the country from her because of a job opportunity and my partner. I’ve been giving her a few hundred dollars a month to help her out. She’s been mostly homeless since then. My dad (her ex) did fix her car for her, so that’s good. I’ve been begging her to reapply for unemployment and she refuses to. I’ve tried to reapply for her but there are security questions I haven’t been able to answer. She even refuses to go to a shelter and would rather alternate between staying a night in a hotel and camping in state parks. I can’t fully support her financially without sacrificing my life, and I can’t let her live with me because of her awful habits. When people get to close to her, she burns them. She’s burned all of her bridges with her family and anyone she’s lived with. Whenever she is offered financial support, she thanklessly leans on it and won’t take action to help herself. She’s incredibly stubborn and refuses to take any advice. I’m at my wits end because I love her and I want her to be safe but she just won’t listen and I need to maintain boundaries with her so I can maintain some capacity to help her. I know it’s not her fault that she has mental illness but her nonsense feels like such a burden on my life. Her sister has offered to buy her a mobile home where it’d be harder to evict her and she could live with some independence, but it’s a slow going process finding a place and with utilities and lot fees I’m worried I’ll be sucked dry again.

I'm trying to get some advice on what might be a better cost-saving route when deciding my rate.  Right now I'm working with my builder's lender on a new construction we purchased for 745K in CA. We're putting 16% down and our rate options range from 3.375% (with $5426 cost for points) to 3.875%. (with $3876 lender credit).  

Most advice I've seen is that people recommend NOT paying for points and for the higher interest rate and plan to refinance with a lower rate. However, by my calculations it doesn't make a lot of sense.  The higher interest rate we'll quickly eat up the difference of the monthly payment and I'll be paying more interest overall. I also don't see the rates going down anytime soon since they were already historically low. The other variable is the plan is to possibly leave the house in \~5 years.

I don't want to kick up dust, because they already had several errors in dates on my severance which I pointed out after I was terminated and asked for a corrected and signed letter.  It was construed as me taking a ""dig"" at them despite me asking initially asking for the correction politely and directing them to snail mail the corrected letter if they did not have my personal email address (don't want to give it out if they no longer have it).  

I'm not hurting for money, but I put 11% in for 401k and it's quite healthy right now.  I'd rather hoard cash at the moment due to the circumstances, I can afford to take a couple months off of 401k deferrals if I need to.

Below are the questions I sent verbatim to the Edward Jones guy.    

**General questions:**

1) Is Company required to offer a change of 401k deferral as part of a termination? Either mentioned verbally or written as part of a termination paperwork? 

  
2) Am I allowed to make changes to my deferral in the following scenarios:

* For a pay period that I was employed by Company, but paid out after I was terminated?
* For Severance payments after I have been terminated?

3) Is the payout of accrued vacation time allowed to be deferred into my 401k?  

  
4) What are the rules on Employer Match and Severance?

  
5) Per the plan rules is the Employer required to provide rollover documentation at the time of termination?  
**Context for the questions above:**

1) As part of my termination I was not given paperwork or notice that I could adjust my 401k deferral for either the pay period owed to me for work performed, or for the following severance payments. Or provided Rollover documentation.  

  
2) On 11/9 I sent a text message (as part of a larger conversation) to Office Manager asking about wanting to change my deferral for the coming payment for the pay period in which I was employed.  This specific message went unanswered.  

  
3) On 11/12 when I received payment for the pay period in which I was employed, it was larger than expected.  I messaged Office Manager and she confirmed that my accrued vacation payout was part of it.  Since my 401k deferral is a % of my pay, part of my accrued vacation was deferred into my 401k.  I brought up my message about changing my deferral and she stated she didn't see it and I need to sign some paperwork.

* Please note that per the terms of my Severance Agreement that my accrued vacation payout was to happen on 12/10/2021, not 11/12/2021.  ",personalfinance,1637261288

91,Trad vs Roth retirement for middle-aged (relatively) high earners,"Hello all! I am contemplating changing our retirement mix for next year and was hoping for some thoughts on the Roth vs. traditional account question. I am satisfied with the amount that we're putting away but I'm wondering if we should change the Roth vs traditional mix. I know the reddit personal finance world is very pro-Roth, but I wonder if that's something that really more applies to people who are younger and/or not as far along in their careers.

To give a little bit on our current situation: my wife and I are in our late 40s, and, to the extent that anyone can predict this, are probably towards the high end of our earning life, making pretty good money and living in a relatively high-tax/high cost-of-living state. At the moment, we are in a 31% combined fed/state tax bracket. Our ultimate goal is to retire to a lower tax, lower cost-of-living state.

Probably we should've put more into Roth accounts when we were younger, but obviously that can't be undone now. At the moment only about 12% of our retirement savings are in a Roth account. It would be nice to have a bigger pool that we could withdraw money from tax free upon retirement; however, to the extent that it's possible to predict, we seem like the prime example of people who are in a higher tax bracket now than we will be upon retirement, in which case it seems to me that the math of a Roth doesn't make much sense. The immediate tax savings we get from putting money into traditional retirement accounts definitely frees up room in our budget to put more into retirement.

Anyway, just curious on people's thoughts on whether we should stick with traditional retirement accounts or shift a portion to Roth, and the rationale behind it. Thanks in advance!",personalfinance,1637260180

Now that we have lived in it for a year, it is very apparent that the subflooring must have been and is in really bad shape.

95,"Which is cheaper, paying student loans or continuing to be a student?","Firstish time posting here, I don't think this violates 

So this is more to check my own math than anything else. This necessitates subsidized federal loans, as I believe those are the only type that defer while enrolled. Currently, I owe 26k in 3 loans, all at about 2.5 to 3% interest. If I pursue grad school, this could be anticipated to triple, depending on program.

Napkin math, assuming 100 bucks a month, that's 35 years to pay off, with 16k in interest.

A single credit at my local community college costs 100 bucks, plus around 150 in enrollment fees. So broken down by month, that's around a $85 a month, plus the added benefit of continuing my education. An added benefit, I currently work at said community college, so tuition up to a point is free. Which makes the cost more like $50 a month.

I get that this doesn't make the debt go away, but it does prevent it from accruing interest, potentially giving me a better chance to deal with life expenses. Or even pay it off while in school, attacking the principle directly.

Potentially, I could accrue certifications and licenses that would increase my earning potential as well. Welding licenses, drone piloting, etc.

99,"I can't afford to save money, am I still doing okay?","Hi all.

I make just shy of 60k a year. Throughout the last several years, I've been saving and spending all my extra money on medical debt. I'm currently finally at a point where I'm not totally swamped by it. Thankfully, since I started my current job three years ago, I've beencmaking very large contributions to retirement. I currently have two retirement accounts, one with 15k in it and another with 32k in it. I took a loan out of the second one a year and a half ago in order to pay for my jaw surgery (3K loan) and I can't repay it back any sooner than it's currently set for (early 2023), but the interest on the loan is just dumped directly back in to the retirement account. I'm going to start contributing to a Roth ira soon, but very small amounts. I was talking to one of my friends yesterday and she's taking a different approach. No investing, just saving a large lump of money. She's super minimalist, and has probably saved up a lot, and she plans to buy a house with that money, and when I explained that I've got my money working for me and generating more money out of thin air (something like 15k has been gained total just from investments) she said ""well, that's not that much."" and I responded with ""it's better than the nothing you've got from your money"" and she said ""We clearly have very different philosophies for saving money."" I'm not arguing with her, just trying to really understand if I'm doing something wrong. I have little to no actual savings. Despite making nearly $30 an hour I only get about $1200 biweekly paychecks because of all my deductions, so I basically live paycheck to paycheck (rent ain't cheap in Colorado). I don't have a lot of wiggle room for savings, reviewing my credit card statement all I spend a lot on is eating out, so I'm making a conscious effort to reduce that, but it won't save me more than $200 or so a month at the most.

Only other thing to mention is I have decent (not amazing) credit, high 700s, and no debt other than my surgery loan. I paid off my car earlier this year and my credit too ka massive hit.

Am I doing okay? I feel kind of behind compared to my friend. She'll be able to get a house soon, and all I have to show for it is 45 grand in retirement accounts I can't touch for another 35 years.

However, I also want to invest money for the short term in index funds. Currently I am putting away money for retirement **and** investing savings for a purchase within 3-4 years.

I can't find any information as to how to withdraw funds within 5 years from your IRA account (including the gains from the investment) for someone not retired under 30 or in their 30's. 

Obviously I don't expect a tax free way to withdraw funds. If I can still contribute $2K to my IRA account but I know I won't contribute that amount for retirement then if am saving $2K for short term purchases then how can I contribute to my IRA account and in 3 years withdraw $2K + appreciation while just paying the tax (not tax + penalty which is what would happen normally I think).

Reason I'm asking is that at a certain point I mentioned that the downside of investing with your IRA account is that you can't withdraw it until you are old but then I got ""corrected"" and told there are copious amount of ways to take out your investments.

29,Issue with Raymond James portal and getting support," Using a throwaway to not tie this to my real account..  


This is in the US.

My wife worked for a tiny private school for about 2 years from \~2016 to \~2018.

She made very little money but had a retirement account. I think she accumulated \~$700 (not a typo) in that account.

The financial company is Raymond James, and some very small local ""financial advisor"" is apparently supposed to help us manage this.  


Our ultimate goal is to transfer the funds to another company (Fidelity) and close this account.   


I think the account is a ""SIMPLE IRA"".  


The issues we are facing are that while we are able to log into the online account, we cannot see any useful information. We cannot see any statement, any account number, any amount, any investment or position. The website shows a number of red error banners stating that there is an issue with the setup.

Online support seems to be routed to financial advisor, and they are ignoring that and direct emails.

Well, they did respond at one point, and shared some data via secure message portal, but that message has since then securely expired and we can't get to it anymore. 

We need at least the account number to initiate the transfer, and maybe some basic assistance with the process. 

First, Raymond James gets a ""0/5 won't buy again"" from us.

Second, any advice on how we can resolve this as painlessly as possible? I was able to setup paper statements via the website, but we haven't received anything yet and anyway I don't know if it would contain the whole account number.

31,Was given advice to sell profits instead of continuing to hold so I can rebuy. Can someone explain better?,"In a recent conversation with my financial advisor, he asked if I had any positions that I've been holding on to, which I do (some 10+yrs). He said I should sell the profits from these, which gives me the ability to re-buy when there's another dip. Even after hearing his explanation, I still don't understand why this is a good idea.

Let's say 10 years ago I bought 1000 ACME at $10. Now, ACME is around $100. I can sell 900 to pocket my profit of $90k, (minus capital gains tax).

Based on my advisor, I would then use that profit to re-buy ACME if it dipped to, say, $90. Now I have 1000 ACME at $90, and 100 ACME at $10. Price goes back up to $100. I sell those 1000 and make 10k profit. 

But what happened to my original $90k? Didn't I just completely lose 90k to make 10k? This is what I'm not understanding this sell-to-rebuy. Can someone please explain how this is good?",personalfinance,1637255886

37,Advice to save the my dad and the land. Please help,"Hello everyone, 

I am not sure if I am posting this I'm the right place. Will give it a try. Thank you for reading and any advice you have to offer.

My dad had a rent to own property, about 5 acres. We had some exotic animals there over the years and it was the place I grew up. 

Somehow through court the owner removed my dads name from rent to own and put just his, but my dad continued living there paying rent and using his own money for repairs for the house for over 10 years.

Long story short there was court this year and the judge  gave the two a deal. At the end of April, my dad has to pay the owner 100k to keep the place (valued at 300k) and which he has already payed more then the original deal. If he cant come up with it then the owner has to pay my dad 5k for moving expenses. 

So my question is, is it possible for me to help? I am thinking I will try to get a loan but not sure I would qualify. I am a mature student, currently attending UBC BSc prog. with student loans. I have work as a server and can make excellent money when I do work. Excellent credit as well. Im thinking the bank might be interested because there is more equity in the property so its worth the risk. Also, I have truck and a mountain bike totalling 16k value I could sell and 4k savings.. 

There is 3 reasons why this is important to me.
1. My dad can stay there and not move somewhere else at his age and start over.
2. This is the place I grew up.
3. The value of the property will help me in the future by either giving me a place to live or selling.

I would like to add that my dad was once running a very successful welding business etc, but it appears the years have gotten the better of him and he isnt so savy with handling difficult things anymore.

39,Home Insurance Denied Claim For Roof Replacement,"Hi everyone,

My fiancé and I live in a 4 unit condo where she owns one of of the units. The condo association is the 4 owners of each condo. One of the owners wants to replace the roof and have wanted to for about the last 6 months. They’ve had insurance come out twice to look at the roof and denied the claim each time. They all want to go ahead and pay out of pocket for the roof. It’ll require $5000 from each unit for the fix. So $20k total.

I don’t want to pay the money and want to wait until there is a big storm to get the roof repaired. We live in Dallas, so it’s bound to happen. What’s the point of insurance if they’re not going to approve your claim? Is this just a cost we are going to have to eat, or is what I’m thinking more feasible?

My fiancé and I share finances, and have more than enough to cover the $5000 no problem. I just feel uncomfortable spending $5000 on something that should be covered by insurance eventually, especially when there’s no leaks or anything dangerous pressing.

My wife needs a new car, she’s been driving my old one for a long time and it’s falling apart. Not worth putting any more money into. She has no credit, so I’ve given her two options.

Option one: I buy the car outright for her and she pay me back $9,000 over 60 months at $150 a month.

Option two: I put $3,000 down for her, she pays me back $50 a month for 60 months BUT she is able to build her credit.

I am leaning towards option two because she needs to have credit. Really just checking for sanity here. I am unfortunately not able to co-sign for her because I just co-signed for my younger sister.

52,Unemployment Advice,"I have been working for my current employers for about 6.5 years. I began as a contractor, but they treated me like an employee for years. In fact, they referred to themselves as my ""boss"", insisted that I use a company e-mail address, introduced me as a staff member to clients, and so on. They were quite demanding and I really should have cut ties with them back then. And by quite demanding: When my daughter was born, they were outraged that the labor was not scheduled, and absolutely demanded that I not go to the hospital with my wife. They have demonstrated a callous attitude devoid of empathy over the years.

Whatever the case, I became an employee about 4 years ago. I figured, heck, if they were going to grind me like an employee, I might as well get benefits and a routine paycheck. It can be a nightmare working for them. Rarely does anyone last at this business. I'm always surprised if a new employee sticks around for more than a few months. The business is owned by two romantic partners who quite literally hide their relationship from even their own employees. But it adds a difficult dynamic, since they are everything: Owners, CEO, HR, management. Everything. 

One of them has an unpredictable temper and randomly gets very heated with me for no reason. I do extremely thorough work for them. I honestly don't know how they could ever replace me. The other owner is hands down the most unkind person I have ever worked with. They talk down to me whenever the opportunity arises. I have never been more insulted by a person in a work place in my life. I always ignore it, do my best to have a polite attitude, and carry on. Say there was an error with some work project, not due to my fault at all. Instead of determining how to tackle the situation as a team, this boss will unleash on me, explaining why they are so smart and how beside themselves they are about my work. It's truly outrageous.

We have to request vacation time four months in advance. They can't be bothered to schedule anything sooner than that. Mind you, these people go on luxury cruises and elaborate vacations regularly. I make it a habit to request all vacation time for the year around January. That way everything is on the books. I am pretty certain that almost every vacation day I have ever taken, they will not acknowledge until sometimes the night before. I will remind them about it a few weeks ahead of time, a few days beforehand, and so on. And it generally turns into me saying, ""Hey, so... Am I still taking that vacation day? I sort of made plans with my family, it would sure be good to know."" 

They schedule work without any respect for my time. It is common that they overbook projects, and it's beyond obvious to me that they don't sit down and figure out if it's physically possible for me to pull it off.

I'll be honest, I am getting really exhausted by this. I have left out mass amounts of details. As of this morning I can sense they are attempting to pull some serious power moves on me after I confronted them about some recent behavior of theirs. They are now demanding I do work over the weekend (when I am not scheduled to work). I was also approved of a vacation next week, and they are scheduling work for me to do then. Though I reminded them multiple times about the vacation this week.

What do I do here? I am concerned I will not qualify for unemployment if they fire me. I would very likely quit if I could could unemployment. I really need to take care of my family and am trying very hard to be mature about all of this. But this is misery far too often. I am located in the state of Oregon.

In my head, interest is reinvesting the money made on an initial deposit. But for example if I buy 1 share of VTI and it grows 10% by next year and I contribute $100 per week, that’s not an example of compound interest right? I’m just shoving more money into the stock market and watching it increase in value. I’m not necessarily reinvesting my gains.

But with this logic wouldnt only dividends contribute to compound interest then since its actual gains that you made from the investment that you’re putting back into your the market to grow at the same rate as your initial investment?

I can live there on my own, but I won't be able to safe any money anymore. Money would be very tight. Then, once my old-ass furnace finally croaks, I'll be in deep shit. My roof only has a few good years left in it, too. So, I have a spare bedroom to rent out and have a friend who is interested in moving out of his parents' place and into mine. Here are some details about the house...

\- 3 bed, 3 bath ranch, shared bathrooms, master bedroom and the spare he would be moving into are almost exactly the same size (\~300 sq. ft.). Spare bedroom will be unfurnished.

\- Mortgage: \~$1300/month

\- Square footage: 1302

\- Monthly utilities (liberal estimates)...

Electric: \~$150 during the summer

Gas: \~$100 during winter

Water: \~$50

Internet: $35

\- Insulated attached 2 car garage

\- In-unit washer and dryer

\- Semi-finished basement

\- Within two miles of main highways

\- Quiet, family-friendly neighborhood with high school right across the street

\- He would have as much access to everything in the house as I would

Am I missing any info that would be useful?

There aren't a lot of single rooms for rent in my local area, but 2 bed and 3 bed houses for rent (according to craigslist) are going for at least $1000.

Based on this info, I don't really have a good enough idea on how much to charge him. I'm thinking $1000 with utilities included, but is that too much? I'm also trying to factor in things like taxes going up at some point, normal maintenance costs, for the aforementioned furnace to finally fail, and to have some money left over for a home improvement project or two every year.

From what I've read, I should get a lease agreement ready to go just in case things happen like damage to the house or he bails. Where would I find something like that?

My spouse says to just set the beneficiary on the insurance to the caregivers and leave it at that.

I was in a car accident about a year and half ago and was sent to the ER because of it. I was there for one day and received treatment and some CT scans/X-rays.

I was covered by short term insurance that was gifted to me by my parents while I waited for the market place to open in November. 

Long story short the bill came out to 48,000 and insurance only covered 310 dollars of it. I’ve spent countless hours on the phone trying to negotiate, but the most I can get is a 15% discount if I pay it in full. I ironically would’ve gotten 50% off if I didn’t have insurance. 

I’ve asked for an itemized bill, but that changed nothing. Now the bill is due in a few weeks, and it’s going to cost basically all my savings to pay for it. 

I’ve asked about financial aid, but they told me I have too much money is savings alone to qualify.

I have been considering getting an EV for some time now since my driving has been minimal (WFH so just to school and back, occasional outings, and errands) and I've been eyeing the Chevy Bolt since it seems to have the best range and features for the price. Now, I currently drive a 2019 Honda Civic EX-L with about 28K miles and in great condition, so I submitted it for sale to Carvana just to see what they would offer. 

I currently owe $13,082 on the loan and they came back with an offer of $27,093, which is slightly more than the full sticker price from the dealership when I got it. I think I financed about $22k after negotiations. Is there some catch I'm missing here, or would I be insane to pass this up? That's about $14k profit after taking care of the remainder of the loan, which I understand Carvana will handle since I've sold one car to them before. 

I could use that to essentially put half the value of a new car down and get some ultra low monthly payments on the Bolt, right? My current monthly is about $335 so I could really use the reduction.

98,Trading in Current Lease for New Lease,"I've been thinking about a possible scenario and it just seems too good to be true, so I wanted to post what I'm thinking and see if there's anything I'm not considering.

I currently lease a 2020 Honda Accord.  Buyout price is approximately $18,500 as of today.  I still have about a year and a half on the lease and residual value is around $14,000.

I've recently checked the value of the car on Carmax, Carvana, kbb.com, etc. and I'm pretty consistently being offered in the $28,000-$29,000 range for the car.  Obviously I know this may not hold true once someone sees the car, but let's assume I can get that for it.  It truly is in excellent condition and has less than 4,000 miles on it.

Is there any downside to trading this car in to another dealership?  I presume that if I could get a trade in value of $28,500, the dealership would pay off the buyout amount of $18,500, leaving roughly $10k.  Could I then use this $10k (minus any taxes, of course) to cover any potential down payment and pocket the rest?  I would either use what remained toward monthly payments, or perhaps pre-pay on the monthly payments to reduce the monthly amount.

I will almost definitely be leasing another vehicle after this, but who knows what the car market will be like in a year and a half, so I'm contemplating finding a good year end lease deal and snatching up another lease while I can get so much for my current lease.

5,401K withdrawals from age 65 to 70 while still working to varying extents those years.,"My SO is a very healthy and extremely fit nurse (RN) who will turn 65 early next year.  Like many nurses she is somewhat burnt out from Covid related issues but is still extremely effective in her job and hopes to work more but not quite as much.

She has about $200 K in an 401K and $300 K in a 403B but not a lot of other savings.   She plans to cut down from working 36 hours per week full time to about 24 hours per week per diem (the per diem salary should be higher but won't include PTO and other benefits).  She also hopes to take substantial time off to travel at least one of the years before she reaches age 70.  At age 70 she probably reduces her time working as a nurse substantially (if not totally).

So far I've advised her to delay taking Social Security until age 70 to take advantage of the 8% increase in benefits each year delayed and avoid the earnings penalty before she reaches full retirement age in mid 2024.   I've also advised her to stop contributing to her 401K once she reaches 65 since she will be working only 67% of the hours she does currently and will need the money to make her nut.  Since she should be making a bit more per hour ""per diem"" and won't be paying into the 401K (this may not be allowed anyway working per diem) and her taxes will be more weighted toward the lower marginal rates her take home pay should be about 80% of her former pay.  At this point this is a ""back of the napkin"" calculation and could be off about 5% either way.

The problem is she will fall to approximately 20% short of her nut some of the next five years and a lot short of her nut any year she decides to take a lot of time off to travel or rest.  

Our questions are the following:

Can she take erratic yearly withdrawals from her 401K and/or 403B during the next five years (i.e., more in the year she travels and less in the years she works a bit less than now).  We realize once you reach age 70.5 you must take at least minimum withdrawals.  

Should she role over her 401K and 403B into an IRA?

Am I wrong about delaying collecting Social Security until age 70 (or at least age 67 when there is no earnings penalty).  She is in extremely good health.

The Wiki has me thinking this could keep them from advising me in a fiduciary capacity. Is this an issue?

Another thing that raised a red flag was that the funds are actively managed. The Wiki states hand picked funds generally don't do as well. Does this matter?

7,To pay off car or not,"Hi, I am debating on whether I pay off my car, invest the cash, or hold the cash. 

I owe \~$24,000 on the loan. I have a bit over 4 years left on the loan, and it's $537 a month.

All in I pay \~$2,000 a month for ALL of my living expenses, including house. My monthly take home after taxes and retirement contributions is about $5,000 (92,000 gross). On top of this, I am in a strong vesting cycle at work and every 6 months I get anywhere from 30k-40k distributed through restricted stock units vesting, so I get this as cash. My total take home after all of this is usually around 150K.

I've got $10,000 in emergency fund. I have $20,000 in easily accessibly investments. I am also married and my wife takes home $60,000 a year so there isn't a lot of risk really.

Is this a scenario where I just pay it off? My primary concern is what the next year looks like.",personalfinance,1637246259
8,Spend down HSA or hold for future needs?,"We have significant savings (retirement and taxable and 529s). We have cash on hand to address most issues. We also have $50K in two HSA (current employer and former employer).  Even with a high deductible health plan, we have been lucky on the health front, so no major expenses in the past or looking. That being said, minor co pays, Rx, eye care, etc can reach a few thousand a year.  Question, I feel like I should spend down the HSA as much as possible. Why not?  Basically convert it to cash (likely to invest). If we have larger health expenses in a few years, we can use cash or liquidate investments (I understand there’s a tax implication there but can manage that). What’s the flaw in that thinking.  One HSA is basically a crappy savings account. The other allows some investment, but it’s higher fee stuff than I get in vanguard, etc.",personalfinance,1637246183

Have owned my house for a little over 10 years. Has been my primary residence for the most part, get most of my mail there, billing address, voter reg, license etc….but have on and off loved with girlfriends over the past 5 years. 

Just finished a refi to a 20 year US Bank conventional loan with WAY better terms. 

Girlfriend just bought a gorgeous new home and things are going well so Id like to move in with her and rent out my property.

Ive scouted my refi mortgage and can’t find the usual “must occupy for 12 months”  all I can find is an FBI Disclosure that says I intend to occupy the house within 60 days and that I acknowledge I bought the property in 2010.

Should I give it 3-4 months so I have a payment history?

15,Pay off Credit Cards or Pay off Student Loan,"Might be a scenario that I'm over thinking so I'm going to throw it out to the brilliant minds of strangers on the internet.

I have an offer from the company that owns my student loans (approx $135k) for a payoff amount of 5%. This would conclude all of my outstanding student loans. I believe the difference is treated as ""income,"" correct? There is interest on the loans but because of the age of the loans they are not doing anything aside from attempting to recoup something for them.

I also have the option to pay own credit cards totaling $10k - each would have a balance of $1k after I do it. I currently get charged about $150 a month interest, and pay down the new charges plus about $250 a month. At that rate it will take me a couple of years to clear the CC.

Choosing either option results in a reduction of my current savings to $2k, $1k in checking. I make $45k a year. My credit score is ""good"" in the low 700s. I would like to begin the process of building a house on land my family owns and believe that Option A might be best for that, but I'm thinking that the stronger ""penalties"" right now seem to be allowing my CC balance to grow with the higher monthly interest.

18,Question on 401k vs IUL,"Hello r/personalfinance,

Right now the firm I work has a limited 401k plan offering, and the fees varry so I am looking to maximize my growth. Any input on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. The money going into an IUL or 401k will NOT be touched unless there is extreme DIRE need. Please see this post for the 401k options. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/qshfrs/how\_should\_i\_choose\_to\_allocate\_401k\_withholdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/qshfrs/how_should_i_choose_to_allocate_401k_withholdings/)

&amp;#x200B;

The plan:

max out 401k in 2022 at 20,500 or to invest that much yearly in some form.

&amp;#x200B;

Details that matter for this purpose:

Jan 2022 my salary will be somewhere between 100-110k

firm offers 3% match at 100%, then another 2% match at 50%. So at a minimum i will be doing 5% contribution to a 401k.

I live in NY so high taxes. 

tax bracket for the IRS will be somewhere between 22-24% on a lot of our income. When i did a rough tax plan our effective tax rate will be around 17-19% yearly.  

I will be married in 2022 so our combined income will be around 180-200kish 

No dependents currently but plan is to have 2-3 kids.

I only have life insurance through my job. 

My only debt right now is 140-150kish student loans, and 180k mortgage. I don't have a desire to pay the student loans early as I can get a better ROI by investing the spare cash. 

After all bills monthly are paid and I max out the 401k. I will have spare cash of around $100. 

I am not including my partners money on this as she might max out as well or help pay for a house. Currently she is saving almost everything to help with a down payment.",personalfinance,1637244035

21,Used car advice,"Hello,

I am looking at trading my current 2014 vehicle plus cash for a used 2014 Honda Odyssey.  The dealer is offering between $11,000(Canada) for my current vehicle plus a difference of $9,800 (can probably get this down another thousand) including tax and certification.  Current vehicle is paid for and I'd be paying the difference outright. I have no idea what pre-shortage prices looked like, but I assume the offer for my current vehicle is a good one. 

Though my family and I are looking for the convenience and practically of a van I don't know if my thought process here makes sense.  My current vehicle has 131,000 KM and the new one has 133,000 KM, does it make sense to move from one high mileage vehicle to another at this cost?  The vehicle is clean with no body rust and barely any chassis rust, good service records and no accidents, but who knows what problems it could start to have at that mileage, conversely, who knows what problems my current vehicle could start having.  I am hoping that because it's a Honda it will last at least another 5 years.

Alternatively, I could look for something newer with less mileage and pay a greater difference either through a dealer loan or lower interest LOC, but my wife and I weren't looking to break the bank here and the thought of taking on car payments bothers me.

Appreciate any advice.

I've read a [walkthrough](https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-backdoor-roth-hr-block-software.html) online on how to account for the backdoor Roth but it seems like a huge headache with a ton of opportunities to do something wrong.  On such a relatively small amount, is the benefit of a backdoor Roth really that much greater than just dumping the funds off in a brokerage account?

Thanks in advance for any advice you may be able to offer!",personalfinance,1637237877

I would like to learn more about a back door Roth and put some money in one myself, but I have a few questions first. So from the get go, it seems basic enough. Start a traditional Roth, and then roll I’m the money over into a Roth IRA after. You then pay the tax of the money being rolled over. So my questions here are:
1) how do you pay the tax of the money being rolled over?
2) is that tax still worth having a Roth IRA?
3) how do you reflect this being done on your taxes? Like when it comes down to tax time and I’m filling my paperwork out.

The apartment itself is nice enough but it's starting to feel kind of icky. Basically all of our neighbors are either elderly, families with 8 kids and one income, or groups of students.

We could easily afford this but my partner wants to stay here so we can continue to save buckets of money.

Anyways I phoned them up and asked to cancel the membership as well as asking for a copy of my contract which she’ll send tomorrow as she was just knocking off.

I've read the boards rules and looked at the Wiki. Wonderful information there. Thank you!

I was sick for five years and I'm just now getting back to good credit. My history is this: I went from 800s before illness to high 600s afterward. I'm now back up to 791, 722 &amp; 722. I have only one open account - a student loan. No lates on the account now. But, during the start of my illness, when I was in the hospital for months, my student loan payments were late over three months. Since then, I've always paid on time. Since I have no credit card I was thinking of getting one to help build my score back to the 800s. However, my loan servicer also told me I'd be wise to refinance my house. So, I'm seeking advice:

Should I go for the CC and raise my score first BEFORE refinancing? Or should I go for refi first? I don't know that refinancing will necessarily raise my score. In fact, it sounds like the hard inquiry will drop it some - even if I'm approved. Is that right? I assume based on this that I found in the WIKI that I shouldn't do both too close together:

***"" If you are looking to take out a large loan such as a mortgage or auto  loan in the near term, you should avoid opening new lines of credit.  Your score will not have time to recover from the effect of the hard  inquiries.""***

65,Savings/invest vs buying a home now,"This post is going to combine many financial categories: retirement, savings, investing, home ownership...

Fiancee and I live in Orange County and have middle class incomes, about 250k total. We are about 30 y/o and own a townhome but we are in need of a new living situation for personal, but very important reasons, that includes safety/peace of mind. A few figures:

270k in current home equity, home value about 600k est.
~3700 monthly expenses (mortgage/how/insurance/utilities/car payments, aka all fixed expenses)
150k saved
I max out my 401k and this is non negotiable
Fiancee has no retirement except the 6k I put into her Roth IRA
Our monthly take home pay is about 10k but varies heavily due to one of us having a commission based job.

Home prices are insane and we are looking at ones in the 850k to 900k range max. This would really bump up our monthly expenses by another 1700 to 2000 I believe. 

The argument/discussion we are having is that I want to keep 50k in the bank and add everything else to our investment account (stocks/mutual funds). Everything that we have one 50k after paying for ALL monthly expenses goes to investments.  My Fiancee wants to keep the majority in cash due to the uncertainty of the markets. Not uncertainty right now , but just the overall idea that markets have uncertainty and you don't know if your investments will be worth more or less tomorrow. Fiancee wants to buy a new home urgently (within a year and a half). What others factors do we need to consider to help us decide on what to do. My thoughts are that our cash is just losing buying power by sitting in our bank accounts. She likes seeing that the savings account has money slowly being added to it after each paycheck and likes the security of it. A huge factor that plays into me wanting to invest is that her retirement is ONLY her IRA right now and she's not prioritizing retirement savings at all. She's thinking, what's the point of saving all the money right now for retirement if you're wasting your time now not living the life you want. 

Something that always resonated with me was my dad telling me that the first two things you do with your paycheck is pay taxes, then pay your retirement account... Then you can do what you want with the rest.  Another thing he has said (and something he has said in front of my fiancee) is to buy as much home as you can now, because money will come later with raises and whatnot and your mortgage will get easier to pay with time. Both great pieces of advice, but I think the order that I've mentioned those two statements reflects the importance of each.

If we plan on buying a new home within the next two years, should we be investing what we have?

Just started my first “good paying” job since finishing University a few months ago. Majority of my credit card debt is from the last year. Combination of me starting the year with a bad case of covid/pneumonia (couldn’t work for 3 months and $6000 hospital bill) while using credit cards to stay afloat while finishing said degree. After moving back with parents and not making money for a while I now have a job making about $2500/month after taxes and such. A real worry I have is about my vehicle. It is having issues and my mechanic straight up said it is drivable but to trade it in ASAP.  

I have been reading post on here about consolidating debts to get everything in one place and myself back on track. My local credit union and my bank, WF, won’t offer me any help in that regard which I get. I did receive a loan offer from Upstart through the mail. The personal loan offer I received is for $13000 at 21.81% APR with $330/month payment for 5yr.

I have been pre-qualified through Capital One for an Auto Loan with a rate below 10%. My thinking is that I need to pay whatever difference I must to trade my car in for a reliable vehicle so that my employment will not be in jeopardy. At the same time lower my utilization on these credit cards by paying as much as I can off via the personal loan. I can not tell if this plan makes sense or if my brain is in a fog trying to figure this out by myself. 

As far as my personal spending. Besides everything you see here I have hospital bills from this year, health/car insurance, prescriptions I must pay for, and groccereis. No rent. Random exspenses may come up due to family stuff but thats it.

I will not live in it but I will work on the maintenance and housekeeping. I was wondering if the property can generate $100,000, are these expenses fully tax deductible?

1. Full electrical upgrade to bring it up to code. Some reading suggested that if it were a long-term rental I could not do this, but it were strictly for business and I use none of the property for personal use then it should be a green light. Expected costs: $10,000
2. Same for plumbing. Expected cost: $15,000.
3. Purchase pickup truck exceeding 6,000lbs. Section 179. Deduct $25,000. Moving and buying furniture and appliances as ordinary and necessary expenses.
4. Solar panels. Expected costs $1000/yr x 22 years or pay all upfront: $25,000
5. Buy a second home.",personalfinance,1637211604
84,Agreed to a settlement with Chase for credit card debt. I haven't received the agreement in writing.,"As the title says, I have agreed on a settlement for some credit card debt. I requested the agreement in writing but I haven't received it yet and the date I am supposed to make my first payment on is fast approaching (\~a week away).

Chase haven't been easy to deal with. Every conversation they seem to give different answers to the same question, are generally very vague when giving details and communicating. And lately since I've been asking about the written agreement they've been downright avoidant and rude (I always maintain my cool). I came to the settlement with their debt collectors and they've agreed to honor it (the debt collectors time with it expired so it is back at Chase).

85,Refinance mortgage every 6 months w/ big lender credit,"I'm currently refinancing my house - we just bought the house 8 months ago, and rates are slightly better than when we bought, but not good enough for me to do a refinance staying at the 30-year term (we couldn't reduce our monthly payment by &gt;5%), so I decided to switch to a 20-year term. 

For the 20-year refinance, I decided to go with a big lender credit (sacrificing rate by about 0.25%-0.375% above par, but still 0.25% lower than my existing 30-year mortgage) option to fully cover origination fees, title costs, prepaid interest, and escrow. To throw some rough numbers out:

|Origination fees|$1.2k|
|:-|:-|
|Title costs|$1.9k|
|Prepaid interest|$0.4k|
|Escrows|$4.3k|
|Lender credit|$(7.8)k|

I know the first three items are additional expenses I am incurring because of the refinance (and are being offset by the credit), but the escrow amount is basically getting refunded to me when I close my old loan, so I view that amount as a ""gain"".

This had me thinking - **is it really possible to just refinance again every 6 months to take advantage of the lender credits (resulting in the old lender refunding my old escrow and new bank paying for the new escrow via lender credit)?** Even if you don't fall under the ""benefit"" of reducing your payment by 5%, you could switch between 15/20/30 year terms.

In my specific scenario, assuming rates stay pretty flat, I would be able to get a 30-year loan at 3.25% or 3.375% with a significant lender credit to cover all (or nearly all) my costs. So basically get back to my first loan's rate, but get two escrow checks (\~$8k-$9k) in the process.

I fully understand the risk of rates rising - which of course could stop the plan to refinance as one wouldn't want to refinance at a significantly higher interest rate than they currently have - but in a theoretical case where rates are relatively flat, this seems like a way to bring in cash flow while keeping one's principal balance relatively the same (increases in the principal would occur during the months in which payments are skipped, but those obviously would be offset by the fact that you're not making those monthly payments - effectively getting a small cash-out loan).

I also believe this is a zero-sum type of activity, and the mortgage banker will get a solid commission each time I refinance, so he/she would clearly be a winner in all of this as well. **But who effectively loses in this process of transactions? Is it the lender that underwrites the loan? If they are a wholesale broker and sell the loan right away, is it the acquiring investors that lose when I subsequently refinance?**

Open to other risks or thoughts I may be missing in this example. Thanks in advance!",personalfinance,1637210659

97,Buying a car: Better to buy new or used?,"Bear with me please, this will be a long post.

In my early 20s, looking to purchase my first car. Have about 10k to put as down payment. Initially was planning to buy used but now I'm considering buying new for a few reasons:

1.) I'm skeptical of private sales due to the increased likelihood of a bad buy, scams, unseen/costly issues appearing in the future, as opposed to buying pre-owned certified from a dealer. I assume certain measures could probably be taken to avoid such issues, but I am not knowledgeable enough with cars to know what to look for.

2.) As mentioned above, I might consider buying pre-owned certified from a dealer. But with COVID-19 and it's supply chain issues, it seems all car prices have been significantly inflated/marked up, but even more so for used cars. This is evident just by the crazy prices Carmax and Carvana are willing to offer to buy people's used cars lately. I also believe the high used car prices are partially because new cars can only be marked up so much from the given MSRP, whereas used cars prices have a little more pricing flexibility.

My father thinks I should buy a new car versus a used car, mainly for the above reasons. He argues that because used car prices are so artificially high, it is not much better/cheaper of an investment like it once had been over buying new. He also adds that I won't have to worry about any underlying issues, because even if I did run into issues, it would likely be covered under the manufacturer's warranty.

Advice like this is putting me on the fence between used and new. Could buying used really not have much of a financial advantage at the currently inflated prices? While I understand that such comparisons/advice will vary depending on what make, model, and year of cars I am looking at, but I would appreciate any financially sound advice I can use as a general rule of thumb.",personalfinance,1637208248

99,Sudden Income Increases and Life Planning - IRA &amp; 401k Questions,"TLDR: My wife and I grew up poor and have slowly worked our way up to relatively high incomes to the point that we are unsure how to handle it. I think we might be HENRYs


**More Background**

I've (33) recently undergone a significant career change that has led my income to double to around $116k and my wife (31) recently received a raise to around $98k. For perspective, our combined income last year was around $130k and we expect to make around $230k in 2022. This is all good news, and we are truly grateful, but we both out earn everyone in our families by a big margin and we don't really know what to do with it. I tend to handle the budget, and I thought our income would grow a little slower and thus I would have more time to learn these things. My plan was to follow the PF flowchart, but I think I've outgrown certain aspects of that chart, or at least have a few more specific questions.

I've tried to be detailed here to give more context, but please let me know if any further information would help. Questions are at the end of the post.


**Expenses and Debt:**

* Our total monthly expenses: $8k /month. We are in an area with relatively high cost of living and a few of our big line items are daycare ($3k/mo), mortgage ($1,800 mortgage), commuting ($500/mo), and the rest is fairly modest living expenses for a family of 4. We've done a lot to reduce this over the past few years and I'm not sure how much we can reasonably do here. 
* Mortgage ~$280k, we locked in at 2.7% over 28 more years, I'm not too interested in rushing to pay it off.
* Around $2500 in student loans and another 
* $2000 in bills that are on a no interest payment plan. 
* No leases or auto loans
* We each have private life insurance ($1.5M USD ea) and long-term disability plans. These are costing us around $300 /mo. and given our lack of help from family, we are committed to this. If something happens to either me or the wife, then the house is paid for and there is a lump sum to help the surviving parent not stress, pay off the house ($280k left), kids with counseling, college, etc.

**Income &amp; Assets**

* Combined gross salaries are around $214k ($116k + $98k) before bonuses, which we can both get though I am ineligible until 2023. We expect her to get a bonus of around $15k in the summer of 2022. 
* $22k in cash, which is around 6 months if we both lost our jobs and cut expenses accordingly. We can technically break even on 1 income.
* Together we have about $92k in our 401k accounts from previous jobs/employers. It is all consolidated with fidelity and 100% into index funds
* Her current 401k: traditional, employer match of 3% for her 6%
* My 401k: 7% employer contribution with no required match (vested at 20% per year for 5 years). It has a roth option into which I am currently contributing 10% of my income.
* Starting in January, will have HSA maxed out
* We each have roth IRAs that we will max out for the first time this year. This was actually our big financial goal before our job changes.

**Goals**

* Purchase a vehicle $10-12k in the next 1-2 years
* A few life expenses: vasectomy, lasik, some house work, etc. (say $12k total in the next 2 years)
* Move (based on school districts) in around 10 years
* Help kids with college (ages 2 &amp; 4) if they choose to go
* Have the ability to throttle back our work load in our 50's, so invest heavy now

**Questions**

* Primary question: After taxes, expenses, etc., we have decided to aim to set aside $55k for retirement in 2022. How best to invest it?
* Our income for 2022 seems like it might be around $20k over the roth limit. 
   * Do I adjust my 401k to traditional so that we can lower our AGI and maintain the roth IRAs?
   * ...or go full into the roth 401k and switch to traditional IRAs?
* Are 529 plans for kids colleges worth it? especially if they do not go to an eligible school (some are state specific, for example)
   * I've also read its better to take care of ourselves first, and put us in a position to help with the kids at that time with cash or shorter-term savings. Advice or insight appreciated.
* Are there any other longer-term strategies or best practices to consider should our income increase further? I'm just trying to build a solid foundation so any advice is appreciated.

0,How does the funding to employees count ratio work?,"I'm wondering how does the amount raised in funding and number of employees in that startup are correlated?

Reason for this is because I'm a second degree student that only has one summer off otherwise, and it's much easier to get internship interviews at big companies with low experience rather than fulltime interviews at big companies.

29,45 year old looking for new career path in CS,"It’s overwhelming to think about changing career paths at 45, especially when that path seems to be dominated by younger generations. 

I’m currently in the education field with a BS in Psych, but have always been interested in coding and tech. In fact, I started down the CS path when I went back to school in my 30’s, but changed to Psych because of what I felt passionate about. Needless to say passion doesn’t equal $$. 

Over the years I’ve learned to code html, CSS, and have taken several C++ and Python courses. I even have a side gig where I manage people’s websites. I’ve thought about just diving in and pouring my energy into a CS degree, but I’m worried about my age. 

Do you all see ageism in the CS field? I’d be nearly 47-48 when I finish a degree. Also, I currently earn around 18 hours of time off every month plus all holidays and 3 day weekends during the summer, which is very important to me and my family. I’m concerned that this just won’t be available in a CS field working for corporate, especially as someone starting out.

35,Tech Lead Offer 6 Months Into Career,"Hey all. I graduated from comp sci back in April and have been working as a full stack developer every since. My company is not a tech company, it's a non-profit, and there really isn't much room for me to grow as a developer. I'm the only full-time programmer and aside from one IT guy, the only full-time tech role. We use a CMS that while it's built on ASP.NET, most of my job could be described as ""admin"" work rather than actual coding.

I still feel like I'm learning a lot, especially soft skills as this is my first real job, but I'm really not growing as a developer nor gaining many transferable technical skills.

All of this to say that I decided recently to get my resume and portfolio up to scratch again and start looking for a new job. I love and am best at coding, and thrive when I'm allowed to do just that. I'd love to work for a bigger more established company where I could learn from other developers and advance my career in that way.

But before starting to send out resumes I've gotten an offer from a small start up company (6 people) to come on as a front end tech lead. I've never envisioned myself going down the leadership/management path, and managing people is really not something I enjoy at all. That being said it is more money (though that's not hard coming from a non-profit) and it would look better on a resume.

I wanted to ask your guys' thoughts on taking this position that I don't think I would enjoy for the reasons above. I haven't even started sending out resumes yet so what if I were to do that and end up finding a job that I would enjoy much more? Then again I also risk finding nothing and being stuck in my current role.

Sorry for the long post, I got my current job immediately out of university so I haven't had to experience job hunting yet so I have no idea what things are like. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.

36,Delaying return offer in order to travel,"I'm a current college junior set to graduate in May 2023.

Ideally I'd like to start work the spring or even summer the year after graduation. 

I'd think that this would normally be hard to pull off, but would I have more leverage since it would be a return offer? (As in, the team would theoretically already know that they want me back.) 

Has anyone succeeded in pushing off the start date until that long after graduation (for Microsoft or elsewhere)?

Having a bit of an existential crisis that I would love to hear some hilarious and make me cry brutal answers on since I'm a sadist. Bootcamp grad currently working in Salesforce. First role was a very modern usage of Salesforce where code was king, but tickets came very slowly and I was sitting for weeks without coding very much. Next role I was under the impression I would be working in the codebase quite a bit but this org is a bit of a shitshow and I am in more of a BA Admin role with a very large wellknown company with promise of getting back to development. Issue is there isn't a lot of mentorship and I would be one of two entry level devs and will probably not have a whole lot of guidance. I recently had someone from my cohort reach out about a C#/.Net/MVC SWE1 role. I have been considering my place in Salesforce as it kind of fell into my lap. It would be a pay cut (probably 15-20%) to move into the C#/.NET role but it would be more dev heavy. I'm a bit atrophied but honestly I'm in the weeds all the time anyways and would know people on the team and well.....google. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on making the jump out of Salesforce into a more traditional (albeit legacy MVC) role (assuming I can even get the gig) vs sticking to the trail.

56,"About a year ago, I'd lost my job without warning in what I can only describe as a traumatizing experience.","A little over a year ago, I was let go from my job. I wasn't told why, and I was let go right there on the spot. Because I had nothing to lose at that point, I tried my very best to get to the reason. Again, they didn't tell me anything specific, but I *was* able to find these out:

* It was not because of COVID.
* It was not because I wasn't doing a good job.
* I was told that it was because of an organizational restructuring, but I couldn't find any evidence that pointed to that.

Regardless of the reason, I was booted without being told the explicit reason as to why/how they came to their decision, and I'd lost my job faster than a bare-foot jackrabbit on a hot, greasy griddle, in the middle of August.

After a year of painfully getting rejected from hundreds of job applications, I've finally landed my current job, and I'm glad, but it hasn't been great on me, mentally speaking. Losing my previous job the way that I did left me traumatized. Since I'd gotten my new job, every waking moment has been filled with nothing but fear. I'm afraid that I'm going to be tossed away again after they juice me of my hard work. One of the most anxiety-inducing and nerve-wracking experiences of my entire life was suddenly losing my source of income and something that gave me a sense of fulfillment.

I don't have it bad where I work, but I also don't get a sense of growth either. With the booming job market, I want to take advantage of the opportunity but I also don't want to leave for the wrong reasons. What are some questions I should ask myself to gauge whether I should start looking elsewhere? What are some warning signs?

&amp;#x200B;

**General Info**

* Base pay = $85k (I know this is considered low, even for the midwest region of the US)
* Been at this company for \~10 years, of which I've only been offered one promotion
* First 7 years were not software. I worked as more electrical engineering based (my academic background). I've been doing software for \~3 years now. Career change was done internally in the same company.

**Pros**

* The people that I directly work with are great and there aren't any negative personalities that I have to deal with.
* I never feel like I'm truly alone when working on something. There's always someone I can reach out to to get their input on something.
* Management does a good job of isolating us developers from the craziness of upper management.

**Cons**

* Only 1 promotion after working for 10 years
* We no longer get annual raises. We used to, but it's since been removed. I was given a 2% raise earlier this year.
* A lot of people work at this place for 20-40 years, which I thought was a good thing since it shows stability. But I fear it also easily stimulates complacency.
* No goal planning. HR does offer tools and encourages managers to sit down with employees to talk about goals they'd like to accomplish in the year. However, my management does not use it or have these conversations with me.
* Career change was completely my own effort. I took and paid for a Udacity course outside of work hours and anything supplementary I learned was self-taught. Management was not supportive both during and after career change. 
* I know I have leadership skills, but they aren't being recognized. I lead a team for an internal hackathon (which is a big deal, there's an approval process, lots of meetings, presentation to senior managements, etc.) and we won 2nd place. I lead a team of product managers, devs, and architects. I had a conversation with my manager after the event and it went nowhere.
* Doing the extra effort isn't recognized. For example, I was told to start an effort on automation testing. I not only built an internal library, but also helped consolidate and define test cases, had input on what the process should be when we test a new feature, and restructured our UI test library. I expressed this effort to multiple people in the company and it went unnoticed.
* QA/box test team was basically eliminated and upper, upper management now expects engineers to pick up the effort.
* We're basically a waterfall paradigm with some things sprinkled in there to make it seem like we're agile.
* People that are in higher positions may get paid more, but their schedules are insane and workload are very unbalanced IMO.

59,"Desperately Need Advice, Thinking about Leaving Big Tech Job After Only a Few Months...","Right now I'm only a few months into my job at Amazon as an SDE fresh out of college, but I honestly feel like I'm having a mental breakdown every few days. This job is destroying my mental health. I work weekends and nights to try to keep up, and the work is the most boring, mind-numbing, bureaucratic bullshit ever. This job just does NOT work for me. At first I thought I could pull it out long enough for the resume boost, but now I'm honestly having frequent suicidal thoughts and depression, which tells me.... Yea this is the final straw.

I did an internship with Amazon last summer which went pretty well, and they promised me the same team, but now that I've come back, and they completely pulled a bait-and-switch on me... The team I'm on is literally completely different in every respect. I won't give too many details to maintain relative anonymity (hopefully) but in sum: it's a toxic workplace with a cult-like culture that thinks being workaholics makes them special, lots of ass kissing and corporatism, and I think I may've also just gotten particularly unfortunate in that the team I'm on is incredibly boring, there's nothing technical or challenging, nothing rewarding, just endless minute bullshit. I've had a very hard time focusing on it and accomplishing tasks with the intense deadlines and pressures. Everyone on my team obviously hates their job too, and are mostly unavailable for help. The more senior engineers are constantly taking time off, have a general bitterness, and are especially unavailable and avoidant anytime I've tried to have a general friendly chat to get to know them more. The culture within my team is to basically just completely avoid each other as much as possible, so I think my team in particular is a problem more so than Amazon generally, although there is a certain correlation with the problems at the company...

What worries me the most about leaving is that they've currently got me held under a ransom with the sign up bonus and relocation. Taxes took a HUGE bite out of it and I put the rest into retirement accounts thinking it would be wise, but now I know that if I leave in under a year I need to pay it back prorated, which would be a majority of it since I haven't even done 6 months yet... Although I'm not sure if I could come up with that, and I know that pulling out of the retirement accounts would be extremely expensive... Does anyone know what it would look like if I tried to leave? I've got a pretty strong resume and I'm hopeful that I could find a different job in the meantime, but I guess I'm just feeling scared and lost. I don't have parents to move back in with, so that extra level of instability is painful too...

I don't want you to see this as an offence, it is just my observation and personal experience. So as a conclusion I should stop focusing on a CS career and do something else. Yes, I am a very sensitive person, but why is this considered to be something bad? Some people told me that I am not ""manly"" enough (employees and guys on the internet in CS communities).

Am I the only one with this experience? Can you confirm that you should not work or participate in CS sector (online communities or jobwise) if you are too sensitive and always require friendly, kind behavior to feel well?",cscareerquestions,1637523945
69,Data Scientist vs. Software Engineer,"So I understand from a quick surf on this sub that you guys think DS is commoditized, is it because it’s a relatively new field? So not many job postings for it? Or is just a glorified statistician who knows a lil coding? 
*Funny thing I thought SWE is the one that’s being commoditized, I mean you’re just coding there’s not much to it.*


I guess what I want to know is why do you think data science is being commodized? 
Does the market *(esp US tech market)* still lacks enough SWE?

71,handling a failing project as a solo developer,"I have been the lead solo SWE working on a hardware project for ~2 years.
Work culture is bland and old school, but fine. Never had to crunch, averaged 40 hours/week for the majority of the project. My salary is $65k/yr + health insurance - at least $10k less than the regional new-grad average rate.

This last week I’ve had my first real crunch, worked about 80 hours, and I’m reevaluating my position.

I am nearing a major project deadline and I know the project won’t be ready in time, or it will at least have some major faults.

I feel like I was setup to fail - not that anyone had the intention for me to fail, but that my managers and product owners should have known better than to let a new dev run the show. I am at fault for over promising on deadlines, and I should be more conservative in my estimates, but I never hid the progress from my managers. I would expect them to have enough project lifecycle experience to foresee this, but they pushed ahead with a customer and a hard deadline.

As I enter another week of crunch, I ask myself, is this my fault? Have I been honest about project progress? Have I been a bad engineer? Did I fail to communicate my needs to my manager? I’m getting compensated low-entry level, I have entry level experience and skill, I set junior level expectations, but I’m given lead project responsibility. Should I see the project through to its collapse?

As the only developer, I do have a strong sense of ownership over the project and truly hoped it would succeed.

Mgmt and executive staff know the project is in the dire straits, and they’re managing the stress well and being professional about it. They possess experience and business savvy so they are likely just supportive while it’s still in their best interest in the off-chance we pull it off.

Whatever happens, I expect there to be some hard conversations to be had.

73,"I can never tell if this story for a soft skill question is good or bad, can someone let me know what they think? How can I improve it?","Okay so the question I get a lot is more or less this:

&gt;**Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult coworker and what you did?**

Here's my basic answer:

&gt;I worked with a coworker who was often lacking in communication with the team. While I knew what he was assigned to, he rarely updated me on progress or problems he was running into. I would reach out to him to check up on him, but his responses often felt unsatisfying or incomplete. If I tried to get more details, it would often lead to no response or he would brush it off with ""don't worry I got it""  
&gt;  
&gt;We had a demo one day. He showed the page he was working on. I was surprised because it didn't match the last design I saw from the designer, and when I looked up the designs, they had not changed. He went on to say that he did not follow design because he felt the design he implemented was ""cleaner"". I asked the designer if he knew about this. He knew nothing about it. The design was never changed.  
&gt;  
&gt;I talked to the designer and asked how he felt, and he said he felt thrown under the bus. I thought maybe this coworker thought this would come off differently, but to the team, it felt very negative. I confronted this coworker to tell him that, while I liked his design, the way he presented didn't reflect him very positively.  
&gt;  
&gt;After this I talked to my manager -- something like this should have never happened and set us back a lot. I requested we set up daily standups. We should also have further visibility into what people are doing. We requested everyone keep pull requests open while in progress.  
&gt;  
&gt;After this, we noticed the teammate began clashing with the designer during these standups. During these standups, we were then able to discuss as a team and commit to decisions. It gave everyone on the team a better level of accountability.  
&gt;  
&gt;We noticed this teammate would still not abide by team-based decisions. At some point as a team we decided that this composition was not working out and brought it up with the manager. He was able to quickly pivot and assign him to a different project and team, and assign someone else to our project.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a brief introductory period, our productivity and morale greatly increased. We were able to deliver features in half the time, and communication felt like it cleared up between everyone",cscareerquestions,1637521936

I’m currently a college senior but feel absolutely unprepared to move into the professional field. My general knowledge on programming and computer architecture has grown in the last 3 1/2 years but beyond that, I don’t actually feel like I’m ready to become a software developer. I can solve coding problems better now than I used to be able to, but I don’t think I have any clue on actual implementation, how to build something, or how I could possibly contribute to a company 6 months from now. I feel like school has almost failed in the sense that it taught us stuff, but not how to actually use this stuff. My teacher (also the director of the CS program at my school) the other day during an extra class session roasted us for being fourth year students who didn’t know how to solve our OS homework problems without the extra class session.

Based on the description, it sounds much less like a stereotypical ""IT"" position and more like a software engineering role ranging from mobile application development to AV and CV tech ([IT FCG Job Description](https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/home/HomeWithPreLoad?partnerid=25385&amp;siteid=5311&amp;PageType=searchResults&amp;SearchType=linkquery&amp;LinkID=3974233#jobDetails=547367_5311)).

81,At an impasse or a break or pending breakthrough?,"I returned to school after the military and some time later got lucky and was admitted to Cornell University's CS program. I did beginner's course in C++ at a local CC and a OO/Data structures course  in Java at GT,  but the level of difficulty and depth of content of those same CS courses at Cornell shot up dramatically. In short, I had to start at the bottom of Cornell's CS course progression to keep up with the degree program in general. 

My test scores in Cornell's freshman/sophomore CS courses (right now CS 2800 or Discrete Structures and CS 2110 OO Programming and Data Structures) has been in the 60s with the median normally in the 70s range (I haven't seen the last test range yet). December 7th is the last day of my first semester at Cornell, and I don't know if I'm even passing.

I knew CS let alone Cornell would be a challenge. From day one, I've been going to office hours everyday 2-3 times a day, getting started on assignments the day they're dropped, reviewing lectures as soon as possible (but sometimes I can't because I'm trying to make the next assignment deadline), reviewing as many questions I can of the ones I missed on tests or quizzes. When I'm not in class, I'm working on an assignment, or I'm in office hours. I try to leave myself a hour if possible for exercise, 6 hours to sleep, and somewhere in there a 15 minute break to eat something that day.

I'm okay putting my head down and getting it done; I've always done that. Motivation isn't an problem, and all I'm left to think is that it's lack of ability. Sometimes, I'm able to figure something out or help someone else, but a lot of times I feel hopelessly lost or don't know where to start. Add to the daily grind the struggle of figuring out how to best split my life between classes and my marriage, living in two different cities, and some mornings I wake up and I say ""fuck"". I don't hate the program. I'm learning some things I otherwise probably wouldn't have on my own simply because I haven't heard of them or thought about a certain way to solve a problem but the speed and depth at which I need to learn everything is intense.

Anyway, I came seeking suggestions or advice from people who've been through the CS degree program and got through it or found something else in the tech industry that worked for them. Some times I want to quit, but there's still a part of me that wants to to stick it out, and yet another part of me thinks I should probably consider other options, too.",cscareerquestions,1637516719

I need a little bit of guidance at this point in my life. Just gonna get this part out of the way; I accepted a job offer from InfoSys last Friday (I know, I know). I’m supposed to be graduating this semester, and when coupled with an extremely checkered academic record from a not-great state school and moderate pressure to get a job out of college, I felt obligated for some reason to accept. The idea of looking for a job for months even years on end also terrifies me. 

I know the reputation that these WITCH companies have around here. After searching around this subreddit for InfoSys / WITCH, there seems to be 2 main themes of either “some job is better than no job” or “WITCH is actually a detriment to your career”. 

My original plan was to accept the job offer, work there for a year, and use that to leverage my way into a software developer position. One thing in particular that I’m worried about though is the fact that some people actually say that WITCH is a detriment to your career and may affect chances of hire-ability afterwards. 

I guess my main question is this; *can anyone who has worked at a WITCH company then gone into software development give me some insight?* What did you do to prepare for your software dev job? How long did it take you to find a better job? Do you have any advice for me? Do you think having a job at a WITCH company made it harder for you?

Anyway, I have been working for nearly a year in a digital agency and I cannot stand it anymore. It's my 2nd job (not counting internship) and I got it through recommendation from my previous boss who I worked with a bit over 6 months but I was laid off. While I get along with my colleagues on a personal level though I don't think I can stand working with a few of them and there are many things I consider red flags such as: 

\-There's lot of unpaid overtime 

\-Excessive time-tracking(also I'm being monitored) 

\-There's only one senior developer who has to be there for everything meaning even non-related tasks to CS and he's working the weekends too to catch up to deadlines.

\-There's barely any code reviewing or training, we are expected to study in our free time and also report what we study in a weekly call along with the summary of how the ongoing projects are going

\-No use of version control

As a result, I have been stagnant as a developer, have no motivation, feeling burnt out, cannot study other tech-stacks properly since I also have to study things related to work at weekends and my manager wants to talk to me privately since he has noticed I'm heavily underperforming lately and I'm kinda suspecting I will be put into PIP but at this point I don't care.

8,Pair Programming Questions,"So my process in writing a program (of, for that matter, documentation or text) is:

- know the problem
- reflect about it
- write an outline of the steps to do
- start to write some details for some steps
- likely run out of ""I know what to write""
- reflect about the current problems at hand
- write more outlines
- and it repeats from ""start to write details"" until eventually I wrote what I need.

In other words there are (many) reflection pauses in the process. In those I may also consult documentation, internet, memes, reddits, etc...

I don't see how those pauses fits in a pair programming session, as I may ask the point of view of my colleague but if he and I have to still reflect a bit on the problem rather than throwing quick ideas that may help or may not.

In contrast I really see the benefit of code reviews, where a colleagues informs himself on the code (if possible) before the scheduled review, then we go over the code together and who wrote it explains while the other poses questions that may highlight shortcomings in the code.

So how does pair programming handles ""reflection pauses"" ? Always interacting with the colleagues doesn't seem necessarily productive to me, as one may be interrupted in his train of thoughts.",cscareerquestions,1637497222

But I'm just terrified that if I change the place in which the hard-set 8 hours have to work, I simply won't be able to do it. It's already very difficult for me to combine university, work, and pet projects, I just get 8 hours of meaningful work a day - and I'm incredibly tired of this, I don't understand how people also manage to overtime. It seems to me that I will not achieve anything, and will become an ordinary slave developer who will work for tens of years until all the juices are squeezed out of him, getting for this not that much worthy payment. At the same time, I see how incredibly experienced developers remain in such familiar places, because they did not manage to make their own successful project / participate in a startup, and as a result, they have to work incredibly hard until the end of their careers, without getting anything they deserve. Should I change my profession? While I was writing this, I became even more aware of my own hopelessness. It seems that even ""promising professions"" like software engineers still remain slaves to employers and will not be able to enjoy a comfortable life in old age. It is even scarier to realize what is happening with people in other industries...

My global life goal was just to get rid of this - to make sure that everyone who works for the good of humanity could get a decent life for it. I wanted to see a unified world where people would work for each other's good, but I realized how unattainable this goal is, and how insignificant a pawn I am, which most likely will never achieve it. It scares me that I'm only 19, and I already feel some incredible hopelessness. What advice can you give me? Should I change my profession to a more human-oriented one, for example, a product manager?

10,Does anyone else hate saying “I’m a Software Engineer”?,"The title “Software Engineer” almost feels like a buzz word now. Just saying you are one makes it feels like you’re bragging. It makes me uncomfortable when people ask me what I do because I don’t want them to think I’m better than them. But 9 time out of 10 they usually say something like “wow you must be so smart!”

I don’t even really know why it bothers me. Maybe it’s because I like being humble? I don’t like people knowing I sit at home all day and make way more money than I need by poking away at my keyboard.

11,"6 million (web dev) tools to learn, choose one","2 years ago (October 2019) I decided I was going to learn how to code. Knowing nothing, I learned the basics like variables and loops with python. In less than 3 months I discovered JavaScript, fell in love. I was going to start a bootcamp in March 2020 but obviously that never happened. The bootcamp had great resources and free content for their prospective students to learn the fundamentals of JS. I am talking about a lot of lectures and/or coding challenges for; callback functions, promises, async/await, closures, prototype inheritance, and Array methods. Even though I had a solid understanding of the JavaScript language and event loop, at this point I had never seen any of it in action (in the browser). I came to the conclusion that this bootcamp focused on two things I had never heard of, React and Node. Everyday while the world was shutting down, I was discovering more and more online resources. Realizing if I stay focused, I can do this on my own.

Kid in a candy store! I can't get enough of this stuff. Actually, it's too much to take in. I am overdosing. Learning old school React, but halfway though I discover hooks. Focused on Node, but now everyone is talking about JAMStack. I see a lot of job posts for redux, so why did I learn useContext? TypeScript, and WASM, and Rust - OH MY!. CSS-in-JS, no... Tailwind is the best?!. Recoil is amazing. BTW ... I am horrible with vanilla js :(.

Master of none. I love it all. Ive spent the most time with React. Comfortable with the basic CRUD of Node, intimidated by child processes. Recently all about MERN, so I am forgetting how to GraphQL. You get the idea. I understand all of this knowledge builds over time. Thinking about what I know now versus 6 months ago, I am making progress. I've also been interviewing, and realize I have a long way to go. All the while, studying algorithms and data structures.

Can anyone provide some insight or guidance? What should I focus on? Is there one path towards the future? Which tools are most valued? Yes, ""just build something on your own"" is the best way to learn. But there are so many ways to go about that, how would you do it?",cscareerquestions,1637493856
12,Unsecure about daily working routine of ML Engineer,"Hey r/cscareerquestions!

I'm currently studying Business Informatics in Germany. Next year I will finish my bachelor and then I want to do my master's degree study. I'm doing my bachelor part-time in a Software Company. So I already have some practical experience in the field.

My interest are very focused on Machine Learning and artificially Intelligence in general. I find it fascinating that a Computer can ""learn"" from Data and then predict outcomes.

Because of that I already did 2 Semesters in a Data Science Team in my Company, where I did mostly statistically analysis. I liked the tasks in general, but the daily work was more focussed on creating presentations for business people and not really the technical part.

Currently I'm in a team wich works on Natural Language Understanding problems. There I'm doing more infrastructure tasks e.g. Docker, OpenShift, Deploying Models, building API's wich communicate with the models. I really like the more technical part, but it's not that ML related. 

Usually in the last semester you work in a Team, where you are going to work after your bachelors. 

My current plan is to go to a team, wich solves Vision Problems e.g. identification of loose screws in trains. I thought that a position as ML Engineer there would be my fulfillment, but recently I had some doubts about that:

1. I'm scared that my day just consists of annotating data
2. I want to think by myself not just implement different models and then see, wich is the best
3. I want to be creative e.g. implement own things, not follow instructions on how to implement Model X
4. I'm also scared of that if I don't like the tasks I can't change in a different path, because ML is so specialized

I really liked the summary of ML Researchers Positions, but I don't know how hard it is to get a research position here in Germany. In general I'm open minded about doing a PhD in a ML field, but I don't know how hard this is going to be in comparison to my current study. I think I'm currently one of the best in my year, but the Uni is not really the hardest..

Do you guys have any experience as a ML Engineer and can take away my fears? Is it really so hard to land a position as ML Researcher? Should I go for a different career path, because ML is so fast living?",cscareerquestions,1637492374

24,Career Advice," 

Hi all, I'm a student from a top-3 college in India (CSE major) graduating in 2022, and have interned at Google as a software engineer this summer. I got a job offer from them, with the TC being around 30L INR (40.5k $). For people not in India, there is this ""hype""(?) that the almost all of the good students at my college score a job with 1cr INR (135k$) TC. As with Asian parents, I'm ridiculed all day (basically saying I'm a failure, even saying to the extent that Google is a trash company).

So, I've understood that I got to search for SWE jobs in US-based firms to escape this everyday living hell at my home. My GPA is good, my ranks in the college entrance exam are very good, my projects are good, I just need companies which pay a lot + don't show discrimination towards international students (in their selection process). Also, is it worth leaving Google? I even tried explaining my family that I can try to change location internally after 1.5 years but they don't care. Would also appreciate if someone can tell if it's possible to change location internally in Google after accepting the offer, but before joining.

Thanks a lot!

For the last two years I’ve poked around the computer science department of interests and decided to pursue a career in software engineering. I’ve been putting in about 6 hours/day worth of studying, coding, and building tiny little YouTube projects to learn. I’ve gone over the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript course twice, and reached 5kyu in CodeWars’ website. This may sound braggish, but I’m extremely proud of myself..
The only issue is that the more I learn, the more I distance myself from that optimistic naivety that was my love for technology. The more I learn, the more I also feel like such an imposter. I don’t see myself as a “software engineer” type of person. I was recently accepted to Hack Reactors immersive program and I believe that the amount of commitment that I’ve put into learning on my own shows that I’ll succeed if I pursue either HR or App academy. I know many people are against this route of becoming a software engineer, but I personally believe it’s a structured path to a successful outcome in what I’ve been trying to achieve, (a career).

I was here recently complaining about being underpaid in my current role ( 65k Base Salary ). You all gave me great advice *(thank you tremendously, you guys are great)* about a contractor role. I ended up not taking it because of the complexity that comes along with 1099 work BUT I kept applying. Like a lot. Like 100 applications in three days.

Because of my efforts, I interviewed with more than a dozen companies through Angel, Triplebyte and Indeed, had 8 final rounds and ended up with 5 offers ranging from 75k base to a whopping 155k base.

TC ends up being 180k with equity.

Okay, so that sums that up for those of you who wanted a follow up!

Now onto my question. I have about 5k in credit card debit left and I want to buy a new road bike which is about $2,200 so I would like to get some cash up front. I hear some FAANG boys are getting like 30k sign ons.

Have you ever heard of asking for a lower base salary in exchange for the difference up front? So instead of 155k/yr, I would get 145k + 10k sign on. And then following the first twelve months, salary would automatically readjust to 155k and be subject to additional compensation review.

In his letter, the governor writes:

&gt;As outlined in attached guidance from my administration, President Biden’s executive order violates Montana law. COVID-19 vaccine mandates, including as a condition of employment, are illegal in Montana, and state law makes clear that contract terms that violate Montana public policy are unenforceable. As such, President Biden’s order is unenforceable.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you are a Montana employer or employee contracted with the federal government with questions about President Biden’s executive order, please refer to the attached guidance for additional information. 

I want to avoid the vaccine mandate by moving to Montana. Let's ignore the reasons why I will not be taking the vaccine, as they are highly personal, and irrelevant to the discussion.

I need help understanding the last paragraph. Does this Montana's exclusion of the federal contractor mandate apply to Montana employers or employees? The corporation that I am working for is in Oregon, but as I am working remotely, they allow me to work from anywhere in the United States. If I will be living in Montana, will they be able to force me to get the vaccine or take weekly testing? Can they fire me anyway for refusing to submit to the mandate, if I will be living in Montana?

43,Expected salary when working remotely for an overseas company,"I currently live in country X and working full-time (remotely) for an X-based company. Since I don't feel overloaded from my current job (I finish my task quickly and I effectively work only around 10-15 hours a week on average), I figured why not find a second full time job to make some extra bucks. So I tried to apply for a remote job for an overseas company, hoping that I will get significantly higher salary than X's salary.

Long story short, a company based on Y country interested with my resume, and scheduled a short interview next week. The question is, if the interviewer asks the ""what's your expected salary"" question, what should I answer it with? Did some research, country X's programmer salary ranging between $3k USD to $22k USD (this seems about right), Y's programmer salary ranging between $36k to $90k USD. Salary for developer with similar experience to me is around $10k - $14.5k USD in X, and  (based on my quick online research) around $47k - $58k USD in Y. Should I answer it with X's salary? or Y's salary? or somewhere in between?",cscareerquestions,1637464306

The truth is that I'm young and I want to try new things. I want to meet new people, to learn a new language, to do research, to speak a conferences and others.

Am I insane ? It sound weird to leave a FAANG to study something and then return to the same kind of job.(because I love it).

Observation: It's Europe so the university is free. I only have to pay for the rent and food, but I have enough money for 2 years of master, even without a scholarship.

61,"Joined a new company, struggling with mental health","Hi everyone,

I have a background in java development for about 3 years and then I moved to another country for my master's degree. After completing my master's I joined as a Magento developer. So my only experience with PHP is in magento development. 

I joined a new services based company as they were looking for Magento developer on Monday. The very first day my lead asked me to do wordpress development. I know it's in PHP but I have no experience with it, I tried to set expectations correctly and sent him a message on teams saying that I am happy to pick up other tech stacks as I go but since I don't have any past experience with wordpress or other PHP frameworks it may be better for me to start with Magento and later pick up on other tech stacks. He didn't reply, he is a busy person so that's understandable, then next day I just thought I'll go ahead with it and asked him credentials for admin page. He then sent me the details and said that he knows I don't have experience with this but they are short staffed and need this done. 

The thing is that I have always worked as an in house developer and frankly I don't have much experience with dev ops, since they don't have any developer who has an experience with magento it is all up to me to set up everything for this project too and I am getting a bit overwhelmed. My past company had asked me to come back with a raise. Frankly the difference in salary was only 20k and my previous company said they will give me a raise of 10k if I stayed there. At that time, i thought that I'll probably get to learn a lot in a services based company with a variety of projects so I had said I'll be joining them but 1 week in I'm already getting a bit overwhelmed and I am struggling with mental health which doesn't help me and causes me to get stressed and really anxious. 

How do I set expectations correctly here? Or is it better to just go back? I'm not sure how it'll affect my career.",cscareerquestions,1637453173

I’ve found out that at my skill level, I could be at ~450k total compensation package for the year. I’m currently sitting at ~200k TC so there’s quite left on the table. Problem is, I have roughly 400-500k of unvested RSUs this coming year assuming the share price of my company stays high as it is. I will be hitting the hard 4 year cliff after next year. So this has me thinking of searching for a new role somewhere else that would give me a total 500k TC for the year or more. (Aiming for the big tech ones)

Yes, I’d be sacrificing like 200k or so this coming year, but I’d be set for the foreseeable future (3+ years) plus having the name of big tech company in my resume. You’re probably thinking “why in the hell would you throw away 200k right off the bat?”

I am an undergrad student in the robotics field (engineering + software)

What should I choose between them if I get offers from both NASA JPL and a rapidly growing startup company? 

I know JPL is the place where many smart people come and where I can learn a lot from the project that I am not able to do in other places. Also, I think I can learn much more in the startup if the company has great leaders and teams. I can see the company expanding their business and hiring more people right now and getting much investment.  I'd say both are great places to me.

my current worry is this. One of the positions from JPL that I applied for was what I've really wanted to join for a few more years. however; I heard that JPL is slow in the hiring process and I would end up hearing the response from them like next year January, or February, or later. What should I do if I get an offer from the startup while waiting for the JPL's interview? Should I ask if they can give me more time? (I think this not possible) Should I tell them politely I'd like to switch my internship to another organization later (when I get accepted from JPL)?

background: I'm a foreign immigrant in the US on a visa, I have Bachelor's in CS from one of the top CS university in my country  
YoE: 3.5  
old TC: ~210  
new TC: ~310  

applications sent: 118  
HR phone chats: 105  
technical phone interviews: 55  
onsites attended: 24  
offers received: 8  

key points that may differ from your experience:
  
* I casted my net only to San Francisco Bay Area, New York City and Seattle region
* I only intended to accept from companies who can offer at least 250+, this somewhat limits my choices but is a luxury that I can afford given the sheer number of interviews  
* I had a hard requirement that the company must be able to provide US immigration support

some of the notable companies that I interviewed with in no particular orders: all 5 FAANGs (Google Microsoft Amazon Apple Facebook) 
Qualtrics Coinbase Datadog VMWare Uber Doordash Salesforce Stripe Robinhood LinkedIn Twilio Two Sigma Bloomberg Zoom Confluent Blend Expedia Tesla Nvidia
  

general observations:
  
* NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK!!!! my application:phone calls is a bit misleading because I would estimate perhaps nearly half of my HR phone chats were the results of internal referrals 
- the market is on fire, however the hiring bar and the expectation is also extremely high  
- not a single company wanted me to do a take-home which was a pleasant surprise, I was actually fully prepared to immediately withdraw my candidacy at any mention of 'take-home projects'
- for onsites, I feel that the companies in NYC and Seattle definitely have a lower hiring bar than SF ones, with couple notable exception like Two Sigma  
- I wanted to avoid burnouts but it was extremely difficult to schedule so many onsites, hence it was not uncommon split an onsite over 2 or even 3 different days by breaking it apart, recruiters were all very understanding of this
  
I would break the process and preparations into 4 major parts: resume, interview prepation, onsites, offer negotiation
  
resume: I interviewed over the past several months, but I actually kept a running record of my major accomplishments from my previous performance evaluations, so when I decided to job-search I was able to update my resume within a single day, I took a slightly-selective shotgun approach: there's enough companies in the 3 regions who can meet my requirement but I'm not going to apply to every mom and pop's shop
  
interview prep: leetcode leetcode leetcode, love it or hate it, shut up and leetcode, practice until you're comfortable solving any LC-medium within 30min then you're probably good for 80%+ of the interviews, unfortunately, sometimes interviewers 
does ask LC-hard during tech screen and onsites that's where the rest 20% comes from, but I think if you could solve LC-medium you should have a fair chance solving LC-hard with hints from interviewers
  
notable exception to this was Facebook(Meta): during my FB interview the expectation was 2x LC-medium within 45min, with such a short time you basically have to come up with the optimal algo within 5-10min else it's reject because you still have to 
budget time to physically type out the code

onsites: this is where the real game happens, couple tips here:  

* my onsite:offer is also a bit misleading, I deliberately scheduled the companies who ranks lower on my priority list first, so rejections early on won't demoralize me too much because I know the companies that I care about is still yet to come,
  I think early on I failed about 8-10 onsites in a row before I started seeing offers, and when offers come in they come in FAST. For example towards the end I was waiting on 3 companies, and within 4 days all 3 replied with offer
  
* get a good nights sleep! I'd rather have a 9h sleep while only practiced 1 LC question, than have a 4h sleep while having practiced 4 LC questions  
* ask the recruiter to schedule the onsites with at least a 15min break in-between (this can be ignored if the entire onsite is split over several days), there's 2 reasons to this: #1 you need a break, #2 I had multiple instances during onsites where I sensed the interviewer really liked me and really wanted to pass me hence the interview may run a bit overtime, it would really suck to say ""oops we have to drop off, the next interviewer is here"" and receive a 'no-hire' when you could had gotten a 'hire'

* MOST OF YOUR TIME SHOULD BE SPENT TALKING and designing: coding is the easiest/fastest part, in a 45min algo round perhaps 30-35min is spent just trying to talk out what the optimal algorithm may look like, 
  what data structures to use, make sure to run a couple test cases on your own because noticing bugs after the interviewer points them out to you is going to hurt you a lot
* RUN YOUR EDGE CASES, even just say them out loud is probably sufficient, but if you forgot edge cases, no matter how trivial, it's going to hurt you in feedbacks
* for trivial functions, just ask the interviewer if they'd like you to actually implement it or is it okay to skip it. For example: function to tokenize a string by space, the class definition for a Node in a tree, for a Node in a graph, there's a high chance that
  the interviewer will just say ""meh it's ok just skip it"" or ""meh you can assume such structure already exists"", saving you lots of time and stress
* for system design there's way too much information, I used this guide https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer
  
offer negotiation: congrats the company would like to move forward with an offer! excited? yes! but don't get TOO excited until you hop on the phone and hear the verbal offer, there were 2 companies that I straight up rejected because it was 
either a clear mis-leveling/down-level to L3 payband
  
* COMMUNICATE! early on it's normal to feel hopeless because you're failing onsites after onsites but once you have the official written offer that's when everything changes: the first time I receive a written official offer letter, I will communicate that with ALL companies
 - for the ones that I know there's 0 chance I'd sign with them anyway, I would email the HR, thanking them for their time, and withdraw my candidacy
 - for everyone else I will blast out an email, telling the HR very very clearly that #1 I have an official offer pending, #2 the official offer expiry date, #3 expedite the process (if I haven't done the onsite yet) or ask for onsite update (if I've already done onsite)
  
* HAVE LEVERAGE/COMPETE OFFERS! I had multiple written competing offers on my hand before I decided to sign
  
* KNOW YOUR WORTH! since I was targeting L4 level I already knew roughly what's the low, mid, upper range for all the companies that I have offers with, levels.fyi was very helpful here

  
* help the recruiter help you, every counter is an implicit rejection of their original offer, but remember that every recruiter (internal or external) is somewhat on your side because their ultimate goal is to get you to sign, so if you want $X you'd better have good reasons: give the recruiter ammo to help them fight the compensation committee for you

I gave my recruiter 3 ammo  

- I have multiple written competing offers on my hand right now  

- I am in active talks with multiple very well-established companies and several unicorns, strongly hinting I may have more official written offers to come  

- if they could approve $X, I will reject everyone else and sign immediately",cscareerquestions,1637441895

Internal recruiter messages me on LinkedIn. 

Had an HR phone screen and sent him my resume.

He got back to me saying hiring manager is interested in speaking further.

I applied for the posting on their website. Then had a recorded video interview where you just talk to the camera and answer questions. 

**Here is what I found weird:**

I had all 5 rounds of interviews from technical to personality check scheduled at once. They were very eager to schedule it quickly too. 

WTH? I usually see each round scheduled one at a time, to make sure you pass each round and nobody’s time is wasted. Anyone seen this before? This is a larger company.",cscareerquestions,1637438758

Seriously.

If you want to earn a good living and have good in-demand skills you will earn 2x as much money in the United States and have lower cost of living. I wasted 4 years of my life in Canada.

Canadian compensation: 102k CAD
Tax rate: nearly 40% after deductions

US compensation: 230k USD
Washington tax rate: low 20% after deductions

It’s night and day. Canada is horrible for workers.

Myth: harder to get a job in USA than Canada for a Canadian. 
Fact: my callback rate is higher in USA from better companies than when applying in Canada.

Myth: USA is so dangerous, racist and terrible to live. 
Fact: USA feels like Canada but with better weather.

If you have a choice and freedom to move I strongly encourage TN visa.",cscareerquestions,1637438368
3,Need Help With Salary Negotiation," I am in the process of salary negotiation with a FAANG level company. However, I have a major problem I went through my interview process without talking to a single recruiter. About what the role was and what would be the salary expectation if it is a remote or not. I mean I have no idea what is the salary range or if I did well or not during my interviews. However after a day from my interviews I got a mail from hiring manager saying they want to give me an offer and want to setup a meeting with me this Monday. I am really weirded out by the fact that recruiter never contacted me so far and even showed signs of ghosting. I still went with the interview setup through email and online assessments because it is a big tech company.(I had a full interview process but these are with potential team members not the recruiter). I feel like the recruiter also thinks the same way I do. It is kind of a weird relationship we have. My main problem having this awkwardness how should I approach the negotiation. Based on levels the salary I am looking for is at the top end of the level that is written in the job portal description. I would appreciate any comments/suggestions.",cscareerquestions,1637438135

I've been trying to search for internships but I have no experience/knowledge outside what I've done in class, so during winter break I want to try and work on some so I can expose myself to different things and prepare to apply for an internship this summer or next summer.

11,I am stuck at my IT job and afraid I need to quit..,"Currently, I am working full-time as a customer service specialist and struggling to learn Front-end. I work in a company that owns one of the major VPNs. My job consists of live chatting with customers and replying to emails. The company that I work for is the biggest IT company in my country. I am surrounded by great colleagues, an awesome office, and many programmers.

I am doing really great at my job! All the managers know me, I have even written a program to increase our work efficiency (a very simple JS program). After only a few months at work, I am already teaching newcomers and voluntarily doing many side jobs. The company really encourages inner career growth and I do see myself there!

But I leave all of my energy at the office.

I have made a very structured plan on how I am going to learn programming. I only plan 15 days ahead but the plan is made to be consistent. It only consists of 2 hours of learning, 5 days a week. I know it's not enough, and even worse, I fail to follow it.

Besides the main issue, the job taking all of my energy away, I have another problem. Leaving this job would mean leaving a huge IT company, all the possible help I could get from the programming colleagues, real work or internship opportunities while learning, and, most importantly, an easier way to get my first programming job (which, as I've heard, is so hard to get).

I am at this stage of learning where I have realized that I have watched too many tutorials. I feel that I have seen quite a big chunk of Front-end but I can't even program simple things that a person, after spending this much time learning, should be able to. I am 20 years old, I live with my parents, don't have to pay rent, and, technically, don't need money to stay alive. I have a bit of savings, however, I do have plans in the near future that would require me to have money and a source of income and are inevitable.

WHAT DO I DO WITH MY LIFE?? Should I quit my job and focus 8 hours a day to learn programming? Or should I drown in misery and learn very slowly?",cscareerquestions,1637434060

13,Should I start looking for a new job?,"I'm a recent college grad who joined at a well know company. I'm an engineer but not a SWE (would rather leave out the role for anonymity). I took the role because it was in an ideal location and I was happy with the compensation (I make more as much as FAANG SWEs). During the interview I kept asking about software development because that's what I was interested in. My boss picked up on this and got a bit annoyed I kept asking about it and said I could only do it up to half the time. The other half of my work would be other engineering related stuff.   


I ended up getting the offer and two months into it I was discussing with my manager about potential software development projects I could spend half my time on. He said that the team didn't really have any. From the get go he knew I wanted to be a SWE. He heavily suggested that he didn't want to wait a year and that he wanted to ""keep me"" because I showed promise. Also mentioned he wanted me to be happy.   


My manager is good manager in my eyes. I took the role because I wanted to try it out. It has been growing on me although I'm definitely thinking I'll switch to SWE. Should I just start looking now? My boss wanted to meet later to discuss coding projects but I'm thinking it's unlikely he'll find much for me to do.   


Should I start looking? I'm questioning my job security and feel if I insist on staying my manager may keep trying to force me out. I knew what I was getting myself into. I probably should've been way more discreet about things...",cscareerquestions,1637434051
14,"Felt really unproductive today, is this normal?","
I’ve just started a new job as a software engineer. I’m still in college and still learning so getting to grips with the Visual Basic 6 in the program is really challenging. I finally got the chance to read it today and I’ve got to say I just felt like I achieved nothing. I read it, sort of got what it was doing. 

When I wasn’t reading the code I was trying to get Visual Basic installed on my own system. Still haven’t managed it! 

Then when we were leaving the one other developer in the company was saying that it was a “really unproductive day, but that’s ok because sometimes you just need to take your time to understand what’s going on”. That developer only works on the weekend so this is one of the two days I get to actually talk to him about the code. I felt bad like I could’ve done a bit more.

Since I don't feel overloaded from my current job (I finish my task quickly and I effectively work only around 10-15 hours a week on average), I figured why not find a second full time job to make some extra bucks. So I tried to apply for a remote job for an overseas company, hoping that I will get significantly higher salary than X's salary.  


Long story short, a company based on Y country interested with my resume, and scheduled a short interview next week. The question is, if the interviewer asks the ""what's your expected salary"" question, what should I answer it with? Did some research, country X's programmer salary ranging between $3k USD to $22k USD (this seems about right), Y's programmer salary ranging between $36k to $90k USD. Salary for developer with similar experience to me is around $10k - $14.5k USD in X, and  (based on my quick online research) around $47k - $58k USD in Y. Should I answer it with X's salary? or Y's salary? or somewhere in between?",cscareerquestions,1637432753

18,Will software salaries/demand collapse?,"
I know this might have been asked too often here, but Im having a hard time deciding between two options.

Im a computer engineering student, planning on double majoring with a second major, because honestly, CE is such a shitty major, you get to know half of what an EE knows and half of what a CS knows, which places you in a big disadvantage. A very little number of classes in the CE plan is unshared with either CS or EE, which to me doesn’t seem like a good deal, I’m in CE mainly because I wanted to get to know both the hardware and the software of things, and to take on a second major. 


My initial plan was to take on CS as my second major, building up my career on software basis mainly due to the unsettling-high demand on software jobs in my region, on top of that, these jobs seem to pay some very decent salaries (Fresh CS students here earn about 1/2 a doctors salary with years of experience). But thinking about this really makes me suspicious and quite indecisive. I can’t stop thinking of what’s going to happen in the software field, The tons of CS students here make me think twice of the situation, and I have a couple of questions.

1- I’ve noticed a ton of CS students, does that indicate that the field is going to get over saturated?

2- Might seem silly, but I have a feeling programming is going to be nearly partially automated in some years which will wipe out a lot of jobs.

3- (This question concerns web-development) 

Why don’t companies use pre-developed platforms? Like weebly and stuff like that. or a better question would be, why aren’t services like weebly offered more often and in broader forms?, rather than companies paying alot for their website to be developed/maintened.
I don’t know how to exactly explain it, maybe because I basically have very little knowledge about software stuff, but I’ve always had a feeling which is that making a website isn’t hard at all, you don’t need hire people/software companies to even making. To be completely honest, I didn’t know websites needed paid specialists to actually get it developed, I’ve always had the idea that it’s a very easy process and basically anyone can do it in simple steps, until nearly 2 years ago.

That’s it, I’ve read the whole thing I’ve wrote once more, and Idk if whoever is reading will understand what I meant by it. Just to sum things up, should I double in CS or EE? other engineering degrees here are doing very bad, top hard-working students are graduating with degrees like (Chemical, civil, industrial engineering) finding much hardship searching for jobs and I’m confident searching for Computer hardware engineering jobs would be as hard.
Overall EE seems to be doing just fine. Because of that I’m finding some hard time deciding wether to take EE or CS as a my second major.",cscareerquestions,1637431562

Why is all this necessary? My experience is limited to strictly in-house databases and scheduled jobs that will keep our databases up to date if we use external services.

27,Development (College Route) v.s. Networking (Cert Route),"I’m a 21 year old guy who’s kind of at a crossroads in terms of career choice. I’m pretty close to getting a basic associates degree from my local community college, and have a couple years job experience (mostly retail based and restaurant work). The choice is between being on either the development side of things or networking.

Networking in particular has piqued my interest mainly because of the fact that I can earn while I learn, in a sense. Get a level 1 help desk job, gain experience in the industry by doing so, work on certs (CCNA, CCNP), all while receiving a paycheck. Then, after a couple years, I would earn my keep as a network engineer/admin, etc.

Development on the other hand seems like a field where having a CS degree is more essential than in IT work. I don’t know if I want to spend another 2-3 years of my life in college/university, while not gaining any experience in the industry. From what I’ve seen, getting a job in development without the degree is possible, but more of an uphill battle.

29,Likely won't meet client deadline,"Background: I'm junior in college. I did an internship last year that involved a bit of full stack development, but of course, the code already had a solid foundation from professionals and didn't need any setup. I've also done a few websites on my own, but nothing to this extent.

I came across this opportunity in October. We met, and I, in complete beginner fashion, agreed to all of his requirements without really thinking about how much I didn't know (and how it would fit in with school). At first I was extremely skeptical about balancing it with school, but it seemed like a great learning opportunity. Without going into too much detail, it's a completely full stack glorified CRUD application that works with a lot of data from external APIS. We agreed that the hard deadline for this project would be December 20th. Apparently he **absolutely needs it by then**.

I have less than a month left before the deadline, and the more I learn, the more I realize I won't be able to finish in time. Even if I do manage to finish, the amount of shortcuts and features that I would have to cut would be enormous.

Thinking about this situation sucks.

I'm a final year engineering student in India from one of the top 10 engineering colleges in India (Non-CS branch). As with almost all final yearites, I've also been sitting in the placements for about a month and a half now.

I have applied to over 60 companies, all either great startups, unicorns or fortune 500 companies - all paying a good amount of salary. And... I've been rejected in literally all of them. It wasn't because I didn't practice - I did over 450 LC questions spanning over all topics and can intuitively solve any LC medium within 30 minutes. It was also not due to grades or projects as I've cleared the resume shortlisting in 90%+ of the companies I applied to. 

It was because in the Hackerearth screening tests - they asked us to solve 3 questions (1M+2H) and unless a student was able to solve both hards or solve 1M+1H and some test cases of the 3rd, you won't even qualify for interviews.

It's just too much for me. But here I am desperate to get a job so I'm solving 7-10 DP problems everyday. But only some 5 companies are left in this pool and I doubt any of them will select me.

Well, it's either the next pool of companies that'll offer much less salary or its time to prepare for GRE.

My advice : don't believe anyone who says that only doing LC meds will suffice. Atleast in India, the competition is so fierce that you'll lose to a guy who's doing competitive coding for years even when you have done more internships, have better grades and have better experience in software development.

I've tried a programming course online twice and it had to be abandoned due to other factors. I have about 9 months before admissions. I see a Khan Academy course on computer science and also a Crash Course on YouTube and I'm watching a few videos and starting to dip in. The question is that how do I translate this to something that college admissions would see? Are there any projects in computer science? Do I also need to learn to program (if I understand correctly, programming and science are different disciplines)?

Second question, what does someone with a computer science major do in general? What jobs are open to such a degree?

39,My workplace is actually dangerous. Is this a rare case where quitting a job without another one immediately lined-up is a good idea?,"I started my first dev job at an office about 2 months ago. For the first month everything seemed to be going really well. I onboarded quickly and added important features to their codebase. I was happy working there and they also expressed that they were happy with my work.

...Then about a month in, they decide that they are going to be doing office renovations while employees are working. It just so happens that I am seated right next to a wall, like 3 feet away, that separates my desk from the room where they are doing renovations. About two weeks ago, I started to have pain in my ear that was facing the wall. I ended up going to see an ear specialist and he diagnosed that I have minor ear damage in that ear.

With the diagnosis, I mentioned it to my boss and the president of the company (it's a small company). I was given a doctor's note to be able to take a few days off and I did. The first day I came back to the office I was seated in the conference room to avoid the noise. However, the next day I returned to my desk as my boss told me the work was ""basically done."" The morning goes fine, but in the afternoon the renovations seem to start again and I hear knocks on the wall close to me. Immediately after hearing that I decide to leave the building because I didn't want to risk further injury. Back home I get a call from my boss saying that they were going to call the cops because of my absence.

So, here I am now looking for other jobs. I already have a few interviews lined up in the coming weeks, and I have about 6 to 8 months of an emergency fund. My question is would you guys recommend me resigning now even though I don't have another signed offer yet? I really don't want to deal with my current company anymore, and when I mention in interviews that I am looking for a new job after such a short tenure because of a workplace injury it seems to be a valid reason. For instance, I still pass the screening interviews so it doesn't seem like a red flag to them. Maybe when reading this post the answer seems obvious, but I would like your input.

42,Big VS small company for internship,"**Background**

* Electrical Engineering student taking all SWE/DS module at a top 10 University.
* Next year ( August 2022) I will be applying for graduate jobs. 
* So far I have done an internship at a start up (Software developer) and a large bank (Data consultant).
* I want to work in Data science - more specifically with Machine learning technical side of things.

  
**What offers I have on the table**

* This year I can do a 6 month internship and next August I will be applying to full time graduate jobs.
* So far, I have an internship offer from a HealthTech start up where my Job title is data scientist and essentially it will be a Machine learning job developing and training a new ML model (at least that is what they told me).

  
I have **done interviews with** the following companies:

* JP Morgan (SWE) - Went very badly - mostly Medium LC questions that I had little foundational understanding of.
* Roku (SWE) - Didn't go very well as they asked OOP questions on things I have not done.
* P&amp;G (Data science) - Went ok could get an offer if I perform well next 2 rounds.

I have **upcoming interviews** with the following companies:

* ARM (SWE) - CPU/SOC SWE job
* Large Defence company (SWE) - I don't want to work for a company that makes weapons but gonna do interview for experience.
* KING (Data science) - company that makes games e.g candy crush  


Given my previous interviewing experience probably going to fail these two but its good experience I guess - I need to brush up on fundamentals.  


**What is my question?**  
**Q1 Essentially - Would taking an internship at a small company hurt/decrease my chances when I am applying to DS roles at big companies next year?** When I was interviewing they kept asking about my job at the bank which honestly was just making PowerPoints as opposed to the start up where I did the most work which is worrying.

**Q2:** Work with the small company seems to be very exciting - The DS guys there aren't from a CS background, some not even STEM - Pay is bad - Work experience/Learning wise seems great - Should I be worried/is this a good opportunity?",cscareerquestions,1637417403

49,Leetcode Question,"I got a question during my first round that gave me a had time and eventually I couldn't code a full solution so I'm pretty sure I didn't pass even though I understood the concept. I'm curious to see how you guys perceive the difficulty.

The question is to find the dot product of 2 compressed vectors, the vectors are in the form of list of tuples of two values (using Python3) where the first value is the value of the element and the second value is the number of repetitions.

Example: Say you have two vectors of length N, v1: \[1133355\] and v2: \[4442221\]

v1\_compressed is \[(1,2), (3,3), (5,2)\]   v2\_compressed is \[(4,3),(2,3),(1)\]

Now find the dot product using the compressed version. Initially I wanted to iterate through N which was not a given value (but it could have been easily calculated in linear time complexity) but the interviewer told me I didn't have to and started writing code for me. In hindsight I should have not followed his advice because that method would have made it easier for me.

1. You can get a fat salary increase just by switching jobs (and you can do this a lot). Adding on, these jobs are eager to hire and pay lots of money for (especially if senior or mid level). That recruiters reach out to YOU. 
2.  People in this field work less than 40 hours a week, and for the most part the jobs are low stress and easy to manage. Doing a bit more than the bare minimum is great.
3. New grads train for interviews by doing leetcode and talking about personal projects, and although an internship helps, it's not needed to get a good job.
4. Jobs in LCOL area still pay a lot even if on the lower end of the scale for CS jobs.

How is this like in other fields? For example, what does a person in the finance industry do to get a job, is there a leetcode equivalent? How much work a week is common in that industry? Is job hopping even a thing for other fields? I'm very curious for how other fields operate, because I've only seen the features listed above for cs related jobs.

In my state college I was always focused on grades, managing close to a 4.0 trying to transfer to a school with higher prestige... Once I got rejected I rode out my GPA and just partied and messed around for the last two years of my undergrad. I dabbled in drugs here and there but alcohol was always a staple in my lifestyle. I recently landed a job in software engineering in the finance field 8 months ago and I've been diving deeper into my vices... Initially I slowed down on drinking following my job offer. I was given around 90k TC in Austin, TX and was really excited about the opportunity. I slowed down on my drinking, but after 3-4 months things seemed to of ramped up to back when I was in my undergrad. The job is generally low stress and I'm pretty content on where I've started my career. The only thing is that the job is fairly low stressed, which is weird in comparison to my undergrad. It's just weird having a job that seems to be way underwhelming compared to what I expected out of this field... 

 I've recently found someone in my area that had some coke and I've been steadily increase usage as my income has stabilized.

However, so far I've been pretty unhappy with the pace of work at my current company as well as the quality of work being put out by my team. Things just tend to move soooooo slowly and I have to grovel to get any work. It's also just clear that software isn't a priority at the company and even though I feel a little too junior to say it, the code base feels pretty messy. I've been having a pretty hard time keeping myself motivated at this point.

I'm a junior university student and am majoring in CS.

After a couple weeks, it started picking up steam and now I've started an LLC for it, and am focusing on building a client base and doing more projects for said clients. I've also got a SWE internship lined up for summer 2022.

The issue is that I'm not sure whether or not to focus on my side-gig/LLC more/less than school, and whether or not an internship is worth it (Would having a SWE summer internship be better than running my own software company in the eyes of FAANG?). Also, I'm wondering how much this side-gig (which has built my front-end and Web3 portfolio pretty well) will affect my chances of being hired at larger tech companies, especially FAANG, or if it's more dependent on how well you grind leetcode questions/how well you do in school.

Will the portfolio I've built with my LLC (lots of front-end websites, as well as Smart Contracts/Web3 and Databases for several clients) help me get hired at larger tech companies or should I drop the LLC and focus more on school/leetcode?",cscareerquestions,1637395923

My programming background is limited to a bit of Python for simple scripts and some SQL and VBA, all basically beginner level.

If I wanted to make a career change into IT/CS, would getting a master's degree while working on some background projects in the mean time be a good way to go about it?

74,Which company should I join?,"I've been consulting at a company for the last two months. It's a smaller financial company but they have big plans to expand and there's a lot of exciting things going on. I wanted something full time so I was interviewing with a digital marketing/advertising firm. I did really well and they offered me a senior role. They made me a very attractive offer and it was a no brainer at that point. I told my current company that I'm leaving and they were pretty sad. Then next day the company I consult at unexpectedly offered me a full time role with a lead title. They said upper management didn't want to lose me. At that point I decided it was better to stay where I was. I told the digital marketing/advertising company I won't be interested. Now they came back asking me if I'll join if they give a matching offer. Essentially they are doing whatever they can to get me to join. I'm super confused what to do. On one hand, I know what I'm getting into at the company I'm consulting at. At the other company though everyone seems nice, maybe they'll have crazy high expectations cause they are paying me way over their budget (according to the recruiter). But digital marketing is an interesting field and I feel it help me get better opportunities in the future. I would get to work on AI. At the end both of them are trying really hard to get me to sign up full time and I have no idea how to proceed. The only edge my current company has at this point is better 401k matching. Both jobs will be fully remote.

I'm a first year CS student at a non-target but fairly good school in Canada. I am looking for any Software devs/engineers who would be open to chatting with me once a month or so where I could update them on my progress and receive feedback. I'm not looking for a referral or anything like that but somebody who can answer my questions.

I don't come from a wealthy family and both my parents work near minimum wage jobs their entire life. I'm a first generation student so I really don't know who to ask these career questions to, it's not like I can ask my parents or extended family how solve xxx about software. I came from a high school known for sending more students to either the local prison or morgue. So it's not exactly like my school had a Computer Science Club or xxx which exposed me to these fields. That being said, I had excellent excellent teachers.

I'm not looking for somebody to hand hold me and baby me, just guide me on the right path when I'm confused. I realistically will not provide anything valuable to you, unless you receive satisfaction in helping people succeed - I definely wouldn't be where I am in life without the kindness of others. I'm just looking for some answers to a plethora of questions.

I’m based in Toronto and have recently received two offers for New Grad SWE positions. I’m having a bit of trouble deciding between the two, but the biggest differences are **TC** and **WLB/WFH policies.** Currently leaning towards Offer B.


**Offer A:**
        
 - 110k Base Salary + 10k yearly bonus + 10% yearly performance bonus
 - 10k signing bonus
 - WFH policy is 2 days at home, 3 days in the office 
 - Poor work life balance (overtime somewhat the norm, being on-call is expected for weeks at a time, working on weekends less common but still happens)
 - 15 Days PTO
 - Offer is a rotational new grad program, where you spend 1 year on one team, 1 year another
 - Primarily work with React and NodeJS
 - Company of 500+
 - Tech is not the company’s primary focus 
 - Hiring in Toronto but US-based company


**Offer B:**

 - 100k base salary + 15% in stock annually
 - Permanent WFH policy permitted
 - 15 days PTO + 1 week break for Christmas holidays
 - Good work life balance (almost no one works overtime apart from management)
    - I know this because I have interned here in the past, and no one ever answers my questions after 5PM~
 - Primarly work with Java
 - Company of 5000+
 - Tech company (enterprise software is the main focus)
 - Hiring in Toronto but US-based company


Offer A sounds attractive due to its higher TC, however I am not sure if it is worth sacrifcing the WLB and generous WFH policy afforded by Offer B. I feel like in the long run, Offer A is better for career growth (due to its rotational nature, meaning I get a lot of different experience). Also, I feel like being ""forced"" to go the office will help me develop better relationships and lead to more opportunities. 

Offer B is definitely the more comfortable option, due to its good WLB and good WFH policy. I'll also get to rejoin my old team, which had a supportive culture and boss. However, I feel like I may stagnate a bit with Offer B.

I'm currently leaning towards Offer B because I'm tired of the CS grind from uni and internships and I think that Offer B will help me re-focus into other parts of my life.

89,Construction Manager - take new job or get raise????,"I’m looking for advice and opinions. I’m a construction manager and just got two potential job offers. I’m due for a raise this year at my current company. I’ve been there for 14 years next month. I’m happy with my current job and get paid well. I’ve been very loyal and in return have been rewarded heavily over the years. 

One of the potential offers is for $20k more but I’m not very interested for a few reasons. The other is for considerably more money ($30k-$40k per year more). The rest of the package would essentially be equal to my current job (medical, vehicle, 401k, etc). 

The new position is for a Senior project manager role. There is no room to climb the ranks at my current company since ownership is out of the question and the Sr PM isn’t going anywhere. I actually could be a Sr Pm if I asked but it would be in title and not really mean anything. We’ve had the discussion. 

I don’t have the job but speaking to the recruiter I’m a perfect fit, they haven’t found anyone else even close to a good match, and I’m very confident I could secure the job after an interview. 

I have a great relationship with my bosses and they have done huge things over the years to help me in life. That being said, it’s not personal and I would be stupid to not entertain a position paying $30k-$40k more. They also have a structure where I could end up in a higher executive position such as VP of operations. 

My questions are:
1.  I’m considering having an honest discussion with my boss now before I agree to the interview. The goal would be to get them to match or almost match the other salary and not even accept the interview. I basically want to stay and wouldn’t even consider the other job if salaries were the same. 

I know my current company and have the normal fear of the unknown if I were to jump ship. Is that a bad idea. I know they could call my bluff since I don’t have a formal guaranteed job offer yet. 

2.  Is it better to actually go through with the interview and then approach my boss with a real offer in hand. Again, they have been incredible and i feel bad doing that just to leverage a better position with them. 

One issue is the other company is 2 hours from my current address in a part of the state where the cost of living is significantly higher. So that huge bump in salary doesn’t go as far as I may think. I would have to move eventually to not wear out from the commute. I wasn’t job shopping and had no interest in moving from my first home that im nearly done renovating inside and out. My wife would love to move (it’s closer to the beaches).

Full disclosure….I don’t like change much. Every big change I’ve made in life has been for the better but I tend to be complacent. I’m 39 yrs old and have worked at only 3 jobs since I was 14. I know I resist change and fear I will stay stagnant my whole career out of fear of the unknown and lack of risk taking.

90,How much will my degree matter with 5 years of work experience?,"I am 19 and in in my third semester of college and have had an internship in software development for the past 2.5 years. They have been very happy with my work and I expect to continue working there until I graduate, and possibly beyond. Let's say I stay with them until I graduate in 2024, which would be just over 5 years of work experience. 

How much is my degree likely to matter, considering I'll have experience from the start?

I imagine it matters more for some companies than others. At present, I am taking classes at a local community college so I will need to transfer to a four year, and am hoping for an online asynchronous program.

I've had some friends recommend Liberty University Online, but seeing that some don't seem to respect the school for a variety of reasons makes me leery of it (though it *is* accredited).

I've also run across such schools as [https://www.umgc.edu/index.cfm](https://www.umgc.edu/index.cfm) which are relatively inexpensive ($400-500 per credit) and offer an online CS program.

I realize this is focused on careers so I'll try not to get too sidetracked with college choices, though advice in this area would be appreciated.

The company is small, the propects are good, and the generic software dev work is moderately challenging, and at the same time, relaxed. On the whole, a good place to work.

5 months later Ubisoft contacts me, I interview, and they give me an offer of 90k + 6 weeks vacation.

I am a life long gamer, and always dreamed of making an RTS (not that I would be doing that at Ubisoft). I don't even have any game dev experience, and they are still offering bring me on knowing I am going to be learning.

Now, I am a little torn. Right now I have a sweet gig that I enjoy at great pay. Conversely, the things I hear about working at the big game devs is not good. Long hours, crunch time, etc. So on the one hand, I feel like I would be passing up an indirect avenue (however unlikely) to one of my dreams of working on an RTS game, but I am worried I am just going to end up making less money for worse work in the end and regret leaving a good company.

This is not OK with my new boss though, who will not accept *anything* getting in the way of my primary project. It's a different way of working than I've usually done, but he's got a point. Not all these bugs on random projects need to be prioritized higher than the project I'm currently assigned to and building.

I don't want to piss off all these product managers, who are used to me fixing things. So what's the best way to say no or work my way through this situation?

14,Urgently need a job? No ambition? Want great WLB? Fine with mediocre pay? Defense could be an option...,"I wanted to bring this subject up as there's been some talk about stress/WLB/antiwork etc. Wanted to bring my perspective as part of the much hated defense sector.

Tl;dr

**Cons:**

- **Low pay relative to other SW companies**
- Have to get a security clearance most of the time (personally, I didn't get have to get a clearance until 2 years in)
- Tech stack varies depending on program, mostly C, not much web tech
- **Low pay relative to other SW companies**
- Depending on project, can't work remote
- **Low pay relative to other SW companies**
- May be difficult to transition out of defense

**Pros:**

- Extremely easy to get a job; interviews are mostly behavior in my experience
- If you put in even the smallest bit of effort, easy to get ranked high relative to peers
- Promotions can occur relatively frequently, especially early on
- Some of the work can extremely interesting from a physics/engineering perspective
- EXTREMELY GOOD WORK LIFE BALANCE
- Getting paid for any overtime
- Basically impossible to get fired/laid off

**My background:**

I've worked at a SoCal defense contractor for 5 years. This year my TC is roughly 180k, due to self-volunteered OT. Base is roughly 150k, got a 10k bonus during performance reviews, 20k from OT. My undergraduate degree was in biomedical engineering.

**Pay:** 

We all know this if you're on this subreddit. Pay is shit compared to Big N...BUT...it's pretty good relative to geographic location most of the time. As long as you're not in a super high COL area (i.e. Bay Area, LA, NYC, etc.) defense contractor money can be easily enough for a upper-middle class life. T04 (my tier) gets you 120-188k in salary.

I've gotten two promotions in the last five years, bumping me from my initial 90k to my current 160k. The first one was from 90-&gt;120, since I interviewed at a competing defense contractor who offered me 25k more, and I requested my current company to match+5k or else I was leaving. Given their level of attrition among young people (again, because the pay is low), they opted to give it to me. I got another 30k about a year ago as I started complaining again and threatening to leave (this time, I had no offer, I was mostly just talking shit). 

**Clearances**: 

Depends on the site, but most sites have unclassified work. My first three years at my current site I worked on inertial navigation systems, all of which was unclassified so I did not need any clearances whatsoever. Most sites have things you can be doing as you're waiting for clearances. At the end of the day, while it's possible you may not need one, most of the time you do have to submit for clearances. The easiest one is Secret clearance, which mostly anyone can get in their sleep after 6 months of DOD processing. The Top Secret one is a little bit more involved, and takes about a year.

**Interviews:** 

Extremely simple. My initial interview with this company asked me basic OS-related questions (i.e. what is virtual memory?) since they do a lot of embedded SW work. After that it was a bunch of behavior questions. I had an interview with another defense company earlier last year: all behavioral, gave me an offer within 2 weeks of interviewing.

**Type of work:**

This is going to vary depending on which location you end up going to, but my location focused on inertial navigation/guidance control systems, global ballistics, and a classified AI/ML group. I started in navigation/guidance control, and moved to the AI/ML group about six months ago after I got vaxed.

The day-to-day depends on the project, but at my site 99% of it was coding per requirements for a customer. For example, we're required to deliver a navigation control unit. It must do X, Y, Z. These X, Y, Z capabilities are defined by the system engineering team, who come up with the physics and mathematics behind how it should work. The SW team is responsible for implementing those algorithms in C/C++, putting it on the processor, integrating it with a real-time OS, etc. Systems/software teams then tests it out the box on real hardware, etc.

These systems engineers are by and large extremely knowledgeable in their domains and may hold numerous patents. I'm currently working with a quantum physicist on a classified program, and in the past I've worked with Aerospace engineering scientists, optics PhDs, GPS experts, etc. I've learned a ton about DSP, satellite orbital mechanics, GPS, Kalman filters, and now more recently, ML/AI.

**Transitioning out:**

I haven't had any difficulty getting interview requests from Amazon/Microsoft, most likely for their Azure/Cloud (although I did get an interview request for Amazon's Ring team??). I haven't taken them since I haven't touched LC in literal years and knew I would fail them. That being said, I do 100% believe there's a stigma associated with working for defense before, and there are examples on this subreddit where they low ball you based on your time in defense. It's 100% a risk.

**Work life balance:**

I've only ever worked more than 40 hours a week on my own discretion; I've never been forced to take any OT. And of course, any OT is paid by the company. As a result, any time I'm out of the office I'm not on the clock. I get to go home early, cook dinner for my wife, stop my cats from fighting, play video games, go bouldering, without having to worry about any work obligations the moment my foot is out of the door. This is by far the greatest benefit that I know of.

**Conclusion:**

Defense is absolutely not for everyone. If you're seeking Big N money you'll always be sorely disappointed. It can be difficult to get out and transition to a web tech or Big N company. Still, at the end of the day, there are a lot of SW engineers out there, and only a fraction of them will get Big N pay. I suspect that most of the people on this subreddit are chasing those, and a lot of them will get them. But for everything else, there's ~~Mastercard~~ defense...maybe.

16,What are realistic expectations for junior developer?,"I've been at my current job for 4 months roughly and interned for them for 4 months before that. I am a fresh graduate but I am decent in React. My job is WP/PHP.

My boss told me when he hired me that he would teach me everything I need to know to be full stack and the first couple months I loved my job and learning new stuff all the time, mostly with little to no guidance.

The last 2 weeks, finally hit a boiling point. I was just introduced to rsync a few days ago. I was told to read the documentation and come up with my own commands, I was given 6 hours. I wrote what I though was correct and did back and fourth not so much getting feedback he just said that's not right. Today he told me it's a simple task that should take hours and not days, I told him I had no idea what I am doing and thought he was going to be my mentor. He apologized that he doesn't have time for me but said these are things I should be able to figure out on my own. I'm ready to quit. Two senior developers with 30+ years told me this guy is a joke and to move on but I have classmates who can't find jobs so I'm a bit concerned about just quitting.

17,Should I Stick with Web Development or Move to Data Science?,"**\*I posted this in** r/careerguidance **as well\***

Background:

I got a B.A. in Linguistics a couple years ago, but after deciding it's not the career path I quite want, I went back to school and got an A.S. in Computer Science with a Certificate in Web Programming. I currently work at the same college I got my A.S. from in the online learning department (I use HTML on a daily basis with very little CSS in my job, no Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap, etc.). The main reason why I'm looking for another job is because I work part-time and am unable to become full-time for awhile.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So with my conflict, I don't mind my going into Web Development or Front-End Engineering, it's just that it seems somewhat dull to me. I like being able to design and create and such, but it's been becoming redundant to me overtime as I'm basically just copying the same code over and over and I feel like I'm not learning anything more and it's no longer challenging to me. I have found a couple of jobs I could apply for in this field, but I'm worried I might get bored and unhappy quickly.

I'm currently going through the Data Scientist course in Codecademy and I'm really enjoying what I've been learning (I've been learning Python, SQL, Pandas, and Web Scraping so far) and I feel like I would really like to go into Data Science. However, because I'm currently in the course (and not even halfway done), I'm having a difficult time finding entry-level Data Analyst/Data Scientist jobs I could apply for. Luckily, I have found at least 4 jobs and applied for them, but 1 already got back to me (2 days after I applied) saying they found someone else; and it kinda discouraged me and I'm not sure what to do.

I'm wondering if I should look for a job in Web Development first while I'm finishing up the Codecademy course, or should I just try and keep looking for any entry-level Data Analyst or Data Scientist job; and if I got a job in Web Development, would it be easy to switch to Data Science later?

20,The dichotomy of choice (what offer should I take?),"Hey everyone,

Long time lurker and cs career ladder jumping interested individual here. I am about to graduate from a top 5 engineering school in computer science.

I have three offers in front of me and I am having a really hard time deciding between them. I know I am in a great situation so please avoid comments that disparage me or otherwise note my situation (happy to talk about how I got here if anyone is interested).

First offer is at a FAANG where I interned last summer (Entry Level Software Engineer):
Base: 132k
Signing: 40k and 10k relocation
Equity: 100k over 5 years vested 5% then 20% yearly

Second is at a unicorn startup in health care probably going public within a year or two (Software Engineer—very flat structure)
Base: 125k
Signing: 0 but 3.5k relocation
Equity: 50k over 4 years vesting 25% a year

Third is at a younger startup in the financial data provider industry that is revenue generating and profitable (like 5M a year, internal valuation is about 50M as of now). My title would be “Lead Engineer” as they are bringing me in to lead a team. I am currently working there part time and love the culture / responsibility. This startup has some really well known entrepreneurs on their board of advisors.
Base: 135k
Signing: 10k
Yearly bonus: minimum 20k
Equity: 800k over 4 years vesting 25% a year (roughly 2% of the company)
I also can start three months earlier with this one.

In all honesty I am leaning towards the younger startup as the compensation is attractive and my level of responsibility would be higher. I feel like I can handle the load as this is not my first time running an engineering team (I’ve worked for several like startups basically full time while I’ve been in school which qualified me for this). Would I be making a mistake by taking the younger startup?

All of the these are in NYC.

Hi everyone,

I am currently working as an actuary. After some reflections regarding my passion and career goals, I am now plan to switch to become a software developer. I have not taken formal comp sci classes before but have some experience coding in Python. Due to visa issues, I cannot go to a boot camp or do a part-time Masters degree. My plan is:

* Spend 2022 self-study programming and doing some side projects. At the end of 2022, apply to grad schools (I have taken GRE before and got an okay score). My targets are NEU Align Program, Upenn MCIT, NYU Tandon.
* Start grinding Leetcode at the beginning of 2023 and looking for an internship. If I cannot get an internship in the US, I will go back to my country to do one before starting my Master's degree.
* Use the first year to build foundations and work on projects/ LC.

It's been exactly a year since I graduated CS, got a non tech job, I needed the money and it paid well, after 9 months left the job and decided to study and work on myself hoping to get a job with my degree.

I was interested in game dev in my fourth year, all my years in college I was lost and didn't know what path to choose until I tried game programming and it interested me, I tool a couple of courses online, watched some tutorials, made some stupid prototypes,
I took a diploma in VR also did some prototype on On VR and AR, anyways, after that I got busy with graduation,

After I left my job I started studying again and taking courses for game dev, I'm really into this and that's what I wanna do for a living, I know it's hard, and it will definitely take not less than another  6 months to be job ready, 

My question here is

1) is this gap  really bad? And how to justify it In a way that I don't  come off as a lazy person
2) I'm losing hope each day that passes, is it really over for me or should I keep going ? I know game dev is hard but I'm giving it all my time rn, I was thinking to learn front end we dev, there's alot of opportunities where I live but I also keep worrying about the gap, or why would they hire me if I'm not a fresh grad.

The reason I didn't apply for a  game dev role after graduation is that I was really not ready at all, I live In a third world country and most offers here  are startups who wants people that really good at what they are doing already, or companies that wants people with 5 years experience.

I'm a first generation student so I really don't know who to ask these career questions to, it's not like I can ask my parents or extended family how solve xxx about software. I came from a high school known for sending more students to either the local prison or morgue. So it's not exactly like my school had a Computer Science Club or xxx which exposed me to these fields. That being said, I had excellent excellent teachers.

I'm not looking for somebody to hand hold me and baby me, just guide me on the right path when I'm confused. I realistically will not provide anything valuable to you, unless you receive satisfaction in helping people succeed - I definely wouldn't be where I am in life without the kindness of others. I'm just looking for some answers to a plethora of questions. 

I think obviously most CS students want to work in FAANG or some Unicorn but I'm not picky on who responds to this message and where you work. I'm sure you can tell me a few things I want to know. Please dm me to properly contact me.

55,New hires - time to become billable?,"Hey there! Not sure if this is the right forum, but looking for your opinions


HR at a software firm here. When we hire a new developer, it typically takes about 4 weeks of onboarding for them to become ""billable"" to our customers.  At that point they've gone through internal training, had a chance to kick around the test systems, have joined some scrum meetings and gotten to know all of the team members... and I think 4 weeks is totally reasonable. There are some variances for experience level, industry specific experience,  and individual learning speed, but 4 weeks is the norm.

How long does it normally take a new developer to become ""billable"" at your place? 

My dev team is looking for suggestions from me to speed up the training process, which I can give, but I don't think 4 weeks average is unreasonable and would like to hear about other onboarding experiences.",cscareerquestions,1637351344
56,Looking for advice on how to best get out of my current situation,"Hi, Reddit; I really could use some advice - I don't think I have anyone to talk to about this.

I moved to the US almost 2 years ago, on a work visa. My family situation was the main reason for the move, my child is autistic, and I could not arrange for services good enough for him back home.

I was supposed to report to a VP-level person of our company, right before the move, that changed and effectively I reported into director 1 level lower.

I was not very happy about that, but my priorities were straight - I wanted to move my kid to a place where necessary services could be arranged.

Upon my move, I realized how bad the situation was with my new boss. They only thought about getting more profit for themselves (sales role) and had zero interest in any of the initiatives that I brought to the table. I tried bringing my initiatives to the management. Still, they looked at me stunned as even though my role was new to the organization, nobody expected me to innovate and implement anything. This is not to mention that my boss at the time, yelled at me, lied at group meetings that they were spending a lot of the time teaching me to do things, while in reality, I have not spoken with them in a couple of weeks.

About a year in, another person (Jane) gets hired for the same role, but at this time, the management sets the expectation that they will be structuring this unit, and I will effectively report to them. I had mixed feelings about that change since I initially expected to take that position, but I was happy to stop working with my current boss. 

Jane implemented 90% of my initiatives that were previously blocked. I never took explicit credit for any of those.

About a year later - another person (Joe) was hired to join our team. About 6 months after that - I feel the winds change - suddenly, Jane is no longer open during our joint meetings.

A couple of weeks later, Joe gets promoted to take Jane's position.

I am super unhappy about the situation; I don't know who to talk to about this. I'm still on my work visa, so I don't want to be fired for not being a team player, but I get triggered every time Joe sends me a message.

Do I talk to HR? Will it get me in trouble?

Do I talk to the VP who effectively hired me? What do I say?

Do I ask them to change my role in its entirety, not to work as a part of this team altogether?

Do I hire myself a career coach and talk to them? Any recommendations?",cscareerquestions,1637351153

The point I feel confused about is during the entire interview process, they asked me limited technical questions, most other companies I interviewed like to give me take-home assessments, but IBM gave me the offer too fast. (only after 3 days of the interview). For me, it is too good to be true.

69,Pursuing CS Without a Technical Background,"Hi everyone! Apologies in advance if this isn't the right subreddit to be posting on. 

I'm a junior a top school in the U.S. studying the social sciences and my focus is quite theoretical. Recently—while I enjoy what I study—I have been feeling a bit as though I squandered my opportunity at a good school by not pairing this focus with something technical.

This summer, I'll be working at a consulting firm (not MBB, but a step below that) and it is possible that I would go into consulting for a year or two before going back to school for an MBA or JD. Hopefully, some time in the workforce gives me some clarity as to what it is I actually want out of my career, and that would inform my graduate school plans.

I have a year left at school and it's not practical for me to change majors because we are given a maximum of 8 terms in-residence to complete our degrees. I'll also be writing a thesis so taking lots of classes outside my major would not necessarily be possible. 

As a consequence, I've been thinking quite a bit about graduate programs. Hypothetically, if I wanted to take the next couple of years to prepare for graduate-level coursework in Computer Science, what would that look like? Would it be at all possible to access combined JD-MS programs at top schools, for instance, without a STEM background in my undergraduate program?

They suggested that I allocate about 10 hours to complete it. I first have to install their agent onto my computer, then complete this 2 part assignment.

**For part 1, I have been given 3 options:** 

Option 1: Application Performance Monitoring project (notice: this assumes that you have an

existing backend application you can instrument):

1. Configure the agent for APM

2. Initiate tracing with your specific language

3. Show how you would implement ingestion level sampling

4. Implement an APM monitor

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Monitor a host

1. Configure an agent-based integration\*, for example, a DB/caching service (like Redis,

Postgres, MSSQL, MYSQL, MongoDB) or a web server (like Apache or NGINX).

2. Submit Logs from the Agent and display the log lines in the UI

3. Create a Logs Pipeline to edit this data

4. Set up a monitor to alert on a meaningful metric

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Monitor a Cloud-based host

1. Create a cloud provider account (AWS/GCP/Azure)

2. Spin up a server on the cloud provider (use free accounts)

3. Install the agent on the server (equivalent to the first step of installing the agent)

4. Set up the cloud provider integration\*\* (for example - Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon

ElastiCache, Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Google Pub/Sub)

5. Create a custom log file for the Agent to tail and display the log lines in the UI

6. Create a monitor to alert you on something that needs your attention

\*\* How to recognize a cloud provider integration - look for this image on the integration help

article (Must use AWS/GCP/Azure integration):

&amp;#x200B;

**For part 2, I have to answer 2 customer questions. Here are 2 examples:**

1. Hey &lt;Company Name&gt; Support,

I have a question regarding monitor setup that I’m hoping you can help with. I have a number of

servers that I am looking to monitor with names from az-web-server-01 to az-web-server-45. I

am looking to have my monitor only reference az-web-server-01 through az-web-server-19. I

tried using host:az-web-server-\* but that captures all of them. Is there something else I can try to

capture only the 1 through 19?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Hey Support,

I am currently sending in both logs and traces into my &lt;Company Name&gt; account. Everything looks great, but I am not seeing any logs come up on my trace tab. 

&amp;#x200B;

**They added a note saying: You don't have to be a &lt;Company Name&gt; expert in order to answer these questions. Treat these as fact-finding missions. Please start by reading through the question to get a basic understanding, and then search through our documentation, blog posts, and open-source Github repositories to get started.**

94,Was a complete change of technology/language/environment the right call?,"Hi everyone.

A bit of backstory: got a high school diploma in 2015, then started my first job right away. Worked as an IT consultant for a very big insurance company: COBOL, JCL &amp; DB2 on an IBM-3270 emulator. I knew nothing about that stuff prior starting, so I had to learn, the hard way. Then I got tired after 4 years, because I was treated like trash and I wanted to be part of a more ""modern"" part of the developing world.

&amp;#x200B;

Ended up in a company that promised to make me learn new stuff: ended up developing COBOL on IBM-AS400. Worked there for 2 years, then left because I had a new opportunity...  


A new company found my résumé on a network and called me. They were looking for a front-end developer. Mostly JavaScript, with a hint of HTML+CSS &amp; Python. I accepted. It was finally my time, at 25 years, to be part of that ""modern world"" I have been dreaming of. I was a bit surprised because on my profile there was only COBOL/IBM related stuff. They wanted me anyway, so I accepted. Workplace is even closer to home.  


Now I'm almost two months in and I'm having a bit of a down moment. The current codebase is freaking huge and I find myself to be totally uncapable of performing tasks that are just beyond trivial. Sometimes I literally understand nothing. I wonder if I did the right thing. I find myself at staring at the code without understanding nothing of it. I keep asking dumb questions, even repeatedly, but at some point I have to stop because I know I'm being annoying and I'll just wait for the day after.  


I hope I'm not the only one who felt like this when starting a new job.

In one year i'll be graduated from a top school in France which prepared us to pass the different exams to become a CPA or Expert-Comptable in french. But i don't want to go this way. After obtaining i'll have a master degree in finance and accounting so i'll be able to do other jobs but i feel like having a master degree is not enough to become a CPA in France you have to study for 8 years after the highschool, i've never had a problem with studying 8 years after highschool just i don't want to become a CPA so i'd like recommandations from you guys about a bachelor that could do well with my master degree. Please take in fact that i'm 20 and will be 21 next years so i don' mind following further studies, also excuse my english",cscareerquestions,1637334785

99,Career Paths: Product or Product Support?,"I had a conversation with a mentor at my company yesterday, where we make software to help employees do their jobs. I had a lot of industry questions, and got many answers I wasn't terribly happy with. But my mentor said this, and I've been stuck thinking on it, and am hoping for some more qualified opinions:

""Some places you work, you're the product. You're developing the thing that the company sells. Pressure is very high, but the leadership is much more willing to invest in your success. At other places, you're supporting the product. There isn't as much pressure, and the atmosphere is usually more laid back. But since you're not directly generating revenue for the company, they aren't as eager to invest in your department. They see you as a necessary expense.""

At my company, our apps ""support"" our sales staff. The pay scales very poorly from what I've heard (I'm at 40k as a post-bootcamp apprentice, but the lower range for dev 3 was quoted to me at 98k. Could go up to 150 or more but I can't confirm or ask). But it's a very chill environment, and we use Agile/Scrum mostly correctly, which keeps any zealous leadership off our back.

I have a friend offer to get me in at a Cybersecurity company, where I would be potentially be working ON the product. The pay and progression would potentially be much better, and it seems to have better benefits/compensation, but I'm worried about the stress and pressure. I'm stuck at my current company until the apprenticeship ends, at a minimum another 1.5 years (been in the role officially since July/August).

4,"Mid-level dev, bored, seeking career path advice","Sorry for wall of text. 

Upper-mid software engineer. UK, CS degree. Mostly Backend experience with some frontend. 8 years experience including grad scheme across a wide range of industries. Worked for several large companies and a startup. 

I'm starting to feel like a straight up dev role is not for me but I'm not sure what my options are. It seems like a lot of my colleagues through the years really care about discussing REST interfaces, having extended chats about service structure, marshallers, request headers, minute details of code structure, build pipelines, deployment and rollback strategies, databases. I can get involved in all of the above as that's my job but I find most of it quite boring. Talking about agile makes me sleep. 

Additionally I see people with much less time as devs getting senior dev roles. And everyone else my age is a senior. I feel jealous but also know that I don't put in as much effort as they do. It seems like everyone else takes a much greater interest in learning the SE stuff. I'm fairly quiet by nature and don't speak up lots in tech discussions. I always feel that others know best/more and I don't have much to contribute. Similar with code reviews. I don't code much out of work due to other commitments and interests. I'd like to, though. 

Now some things which I DO like. I once had a job which involved writing algorithms for graph traversal, that was fun to work out efficient ways to solve the issues. I guess I like more CS stuff than SE. I enjoyed learning about Elasticsearch, deploying it, teaching others about it and using it to solve a major issue at that company (viewing logs). I do like teaching. I also enjoyed talking with users of an internal tool and adding complex new features to the UI (supported by backend changes). I absolutely LOVED seeing their reactions to the new features and getting feedback.

Although I'm not a big casual talker I am personable and liked a lot (this is from 360 feedback and general observations). I'm pretty positive. Not afraid of public speaking although I'm not super eloquent on the fly.

I love tech and being hands-on and could've been an mechanic/engineer/roboticist in another life. I'm just wondering if there's something better suited for me. I have a few general ideas but would like to hear any suggestions. I can continue on this path, maybe get senior dev some day (current manager is supportive of trying next year). Then the usual course after that is tech lead or manager but neither one sounds interesting to me.

9,Stay in current company/team and try to move to PM or move to new company as a SWE and then try for PM?,"Basically I’m at a point right now that I eventually want to try out product management and currently working at a SWE with no PM experience. My thoughts are that I have two options:

1. Stay with my current team and try to switch to the PM side. Some considerations: 
    - Current project has a 6 month timeline so most likely would need to finish it before trying to move to PM
    - No guarantee current manager would let me change. In a eng crunch, manager trying to get more engineers 
    - Current team’s PM is kinda like a quasi product/project management mix, not pure product

2. Switch to a new company as a SWE that is also know for its PMs and try to switch after a little while. Some considerations:
    - Would probably need to stay a SWE for a year at new company
    - Would get paid more in the meantime while switching 
    - Still no guarantee I could actually do an internal move

Also wanted to say, it’s not like I don’t like SWE anymore. I do like it, I just think I might like PM better and it might better align with career goals.

12,"With a CS degree and work experience in another field, how much project work would you really need to get a software developer job?","I graduated two years ago with a double major in math and CS. I did pretty well academically, around a 3.85 GPA from a pretty decent university. At the time, I enjoyed coding well enough but didn’t have a huge passion for it, so I never really did any projects. I ended up getting an internship in options trading and have done that since.

The job has turned out to be really stressful in that in demands constant attention (no lunch break) and overall I am just not enjoying the culture of the industry. A couple of friends I had in college that now work as SWEs have similar personalities/life values as me and think I would like it, so I am inclined to switch.

These friends also insist that if I refreshed my programming skills a little bit and maybe did one project that I should be able to find a job, with one saying he didn’t even think a project might be necessary. But that contrasts with what I read on this sub and elsewhere, which seems to say that the market is flooded with entry level apps, and that getting a job will be next to impossible without projects and internship experiences.

So, which one is it? For context, I am not interested in a super competitive job or anything. I’d expect any SWE job to be challenging and pay decently, and beyond that would not care for prestige.",cscareerquestions,1637329369

What should I do in this situation, do bad work at the company so they don't end up offering me a PPO or just reject the PPO if I am offered looking more into off campus placements and stuff. I have a year before the final placement season, but if I do not end up getting a better offer than this company via off campus opportunities, I think I might end up regretting the decision.

Equity- ~5k
Sign on- 5k
TC ~100k (including 401k and such)

I’ve just recently started browsing on here and Blind and I’m shocked how much people are making, especially job hopping after a couple years. Luckily it seems like I’ve gotten past the first job barrier, but I can already tell I’m going to be hungry for the coin, which leads me to my question:

Would I be out of my mind to start dabbling in LC and studying DS&amp;A for future opportunities even though I haven’t even started my first job? If it matters, I haven’t dealt with DS&amp;A heavily since I took the course three years ago, so I’m definitely rusty.

Note: I like to think I’m one of the more personable/communicative people from what I’ve seen in my CS classes, and despite the 2.6 I don’t think I’ll be a dog water dev, I just got very unlucky with professors.",cscareerquestions,1637302445

53,Looking for advise.,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a first year CS student at a non-target but fairly good school in Canada. I am looking for any Software devs/engineers who would be open to chatting with me once a month or so where I could update them on my progress and receive feedback. I'm not looking for a referral or anything like that but somebody who can answer my questions.

I don't come from a wealthy family and both my parents work near minimum wage jobs their entire life. I'm a first generation student so I really don't know who to ask these career questions to, it's not like I can ask my parents or extended family how solve xxx about software. I came from a high school known for sending more students to either the local prison or morgue. So it's not exactly like my school had a Computer Science Club or xxx which exposed me to these fields. That being said, I had excellent excellent teachers.

I'm not looking for somebody to hand hold me and baby me, just guide me on the right path when I'm confused. I realistically will not provide anything valuable to you, unless you receive satisfaction in helping people succeed - I definely wouldn't be where I am in life without the kindness of others. I'm just looking for some answers to a plethora of questions. 

I think obviously most CS students want to work in FAANG or some Unicorn but I'm not picky on who responds to this message and where you work. I'm sure you can tell me a few things I want to know. Please dm me to properly contact me.

Thanks for Reading,

54,"Accepted a job offer, but failing a class. Need advice","Hi all,

During this semester (Fall), I accepted a job offer for a company. I went through some mental hardship during the semester, and now I am now failing a class that, honestly, I deserve to fail (not looking for sympathy). 

There are 2 main things rummaging around in my head currently.

1st, I know I need to talk to my professor. I'll be showing up to his next office hours. I plan to tell him my situation including the job offer. I guess my game plan for that meeting is to ask him if there's anything that I can do to make any assignments that I failed or if there's anything we can do to accommodate my situation. If he's not willing or cannot do so, I will be going to my advisor or department head and talking to him about either 1) retaking the class during Winter somehow (at my uni or another) 2) if there's any independent study or anything that I can complete in lieu of that class, as well as fielding any suggestions from him. 

2nd, and \*the part that I need advice on\*, is what to do with my employer. After searching for similar posts on this subreddit, there seem to be 2 main options that you guys come up with. 

The first option is employing a ""don't ask don't tell"" policy with my new employer, which I have heard mixed advice about. There is nothing in my offer letter that says that a degree is expected or required for this job, but there IS a super brief line that says something about ""educational background checks"". 

The second option is telling my future employer the truth about my delayed graduation (I do not expect them to be happy about it, kind of expecting them to fire me / rescind their offer), and trying to either work while taking the class on the side, or delaying my start date. 

The only reason why I would consider the ""don't ask don't tell"" policy comes from the fact that I am worried about my ability to get hired out of college now that I have failed a class in my last semester, and will now possibly have to take another semester with only that class. That's a terrible look on its own, and I already don't have a great GPA and I know my one internship's credibility will fade with time (it ended in June this year). If I'm able to take this job, I wouldn't be too worried about how my transcript looks as I would have professional experience. 

What do you guys think? 

p.s. feel free to tell me how much of a dumb ass I am for failing a class in my last semester. I've been beating myself up over it more than anyone else ever could lol.",cscareerquestions,1637300918

I spent a fair amount of time in ColdFusion to start many years ago and moved into C#. However I then moved into CSS and UI development which led me fo do Accessibility changes. I also spent the last two years as a developer/scrum master leading.

I’ve recently been moved to a new application that uses a ton of technologies that I really haven’t been exposed to such as AngularJS, Rest API, legacy aspx, multiple projects all linked together by magic it seems, etc… and it’s all just overwhelming.  It’s hard to even know where to start to understand things.

I have enough money saved to sustain me for quite some time, though I'm hoping to not be unemployed for more than a couple months. The reason it may come down to this is because, I would like to give myself the chance to properly prepare for technical interviews and learn frameworks / technologies I would like to make a career of as a developer and I just have no foreseeable way of getting that experience now--I work long hours and have a lot of personal stuff going on in life that it's difficult for me to do this outside of work hours. 

While I do plan to begin this preparation now anyway, I think it may come down to leaving before I have something lined up because I can't put the resources into moving hundreds of miles back when I don't intend to stay in said company/city long. I'm worried about two things:

1.) My buddy that works at google said that he strongly advised against this as most companies would just skip over my application seeing that I'm unemployed because they'd just assume I got fired or something, or question the gap regardless

2.) Being in a weaker position for salary negotiation since I wouldn't actually have a job at the moment so I would need one and well, as they say, beggars can't be choosers.

99,Help with understanding contracted job for JR Android Developer,"Too Long Didn't Read:

I need to better understand a contract document from a complicated company to hire me. Anyone knows an affordable lawyer or mentor to help me understand the contract?  
**($30/hr, 2yr contract, $37 or $40 after one year, relocation may be needed, and up to $20K fine if I break the contract)**  


My Background;

I've been applying for many entry-level web dev jobs in the last six months, but I couldn't get a job. I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, bootstrap, git version control, and a good knowledge of JavaScript. I'm studying React.js now from ZeroToMastery. I've around two semesters left to complete my associate's in science from a college in the SF Bay area.

The Story;

I've been contacted by a recruiter, they are hiring for android dev, and it's ok to have a front-end background, they said. They'll take me to 6 weeks of learning android dev and two weeks of resume tips&amp;tricks, applying for jobs that they have strong contacts with. I completed two technical and one final round interview with the co-founder of this LLC company. 

The Problem:

They sent me the contract, and some of the **sentences are made with more than 70 words, so it's tough for me to understand what they're covering and what is not entirely**. So I need professional help to understand what I'm signing. 

Some Benefits VS My other concerns:

1- They pay for flight tickets to travel to the worksite or my place if it's remote. I must accept the job offer after taking interviews with the list of the companies that they have strong contact with. My concern is, I live in the SF Bay area, and I got used to it here; I don't know if I'll have to work for a company where it's located in a very small town or a very warm place like vegas or texas. It'll be hard for me to adapt to a small town.  


2- They'll pay $30/hr for the first year, and between $37-$40 for the 2nd year. They cover accommodation for the first two weeks if I need to work in person. I see many Jr Devs hired at a better salary and don't need to deal with unpredictable relocation and 2yr contracts. I'll need to pay my last 3 months of income, up to $20K if I break the contract. I'm also concerned about what'd happen if I can't get a job after the training.   


Basically, I'm here to get a better understanding, not to get ripped off since the company that I'm dealing with isn't a well-known company with honest reviews. BTW, They have fake glassdoor reviews and I haven't seen anyone that's been through this process on Reddit. **Should I take the job?**",cscareerquestions,1637281326

My wife is a Software Engineer and she told me she’s under a lot of pressure to do well on some project that she’s on. The thing is, the engineering team at her company assigned only her to work on it. She’s super smart but she’s kind of introverted and is not sure how to ask for help from her manager. 

She said she feels like she would benefit from having a mentor or someone else with her on this project. 

Anyone ever been in this position? How did you bring this up to the boss?  Greatly appreciate some advice/insight/conversation guide! 

Thank you.",cscareerquestions,1637280270

7,How do you overcome the anxiety and the unknown? How did you overcome your initial struggle as a software engineer?,"To all new and experienced software engineers, how do you deal with the stress and anxiety of not knowing what to do? How did you overcome your initial struggle as a software engineer?

I am an entry level software engineer working at a financial company. I've joined the company 3 weeks ago and today I was assigned a task to investigate few bugs found in our server. I have to figure out why the issue is happening and locate its source. Now, the company holds enormous repositories and deals with millions of data. Their code is giant, with thousands of various classes, DB procedure calls, batch processes, and none of them are well documented. 

At first, I tired to replicate the issue with very little document I had. However after spending some time, my mentor told me that it is very difficult. (the QA's could not replicate the issue and that's why the task was handed over to me).

I've then asked my mentor for guidance and some resources on a overview of how the system works, but apparently the system is very old and although there are some resources they are not well maintained. However, with his help I'm able to at least figure out how I should start my task. The problem is, I still don't really know what I'm doing and if I'm looking at the right code.

I'm trying to figure things out as I go and on my own and I don't want to bother other devs until I know what to ask and have some sort of basic understanding of the issue at hand. Yet, I am very overwhelmed because I am not familiar with the system architecture and I feel like I might be going down a rabbit hole. So I ask my mentor for help again but even with that I didn't make much progress.

The problem is that although I know I am new and the first few months is going to be a struggle familiarizing yourself with the system, I feel very inadequate not knowing what to do and how to proceed with my work without guidance. I am sometime anxious to ask questions because I don't know if this is something I should figure out on my own. I keep thinking, ""What if I'm not able to finish this?"", ""What if I'm still clueless after 3 months?""

I know these negative thoughts are not going to help me figuring out a solution to my task. But I get trapped in these ""unknown"" possibilities of what can happen to me. 

So my question to you all is how did you overcome your initial struggle at your first job? Were there any tasks or projects where you were not able to complete due to your experience and knowledge at the time? How can I fight these thoughts and just keep moving forward even if I fail?",cscareerquestions,1637278749

9,Should I look for a job while still in college or an internship? Do you think an internship would be better ?,"I'm a CS student going to graduate in December of 2022.

I've been there for 1 year this month so I ask for a raise and they say I have to wait until the end of the year and they told me they don't give raises every year so don't expect it. Not in those exact words but basically what they said. 

I just feel like I'm not valued and underpaid. I decided I want out. I've just heard how hard it is to get a job as a software developer or engineer and I just hope I can get something.

10,C2C Contractor as my first job. Should I look for a new job after 1 year?,"I've seen people talk a lot about how expensive and time consuming to train a new grad for his/her first job, and it is a red flag for recruiters to see people leave the first job after one year.

My situation is a bit different, I am a new grad who signed a 1-year contract with a consulting firm, and I am currently working for an F500 non-tech company as a contractor. I do not plan to continue my contract after one year.

If I started looking for a job with consulting firm's name and end client's name on my resume, would that be a different situation compared to those who left their first full-time job with only 1 YOE?

18,How full stack should my stack be?,"Hi all,

Software developer for around a decade here. Initially working in .NET Forms, WPF, then moving towards [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC and then to Angular + .NET Core, which I have enjoyed so much! I seriously love that tech stack.

I've been in my current role for around 3 years and first 2.5 years have been great - lots of greenfield development in .NET Core + Angular. Quite fast paced and exciting. Lots of opportunities for innovation and creativity.

There's been a shift since the company moved to Azure and a few other reasons however - ongoing employees don't really do any new development, instead focusing on multitude of many legacy systems, many in classic ASP, Ruby, Java, etc. Overwhelming majority of new development is done by contractors, which come in, do 3, 6 or 12 months contracts and leave.

Besides production support, there's been lots of focus on the cloud, so basically all ongoing devs are expected to be super excited to work with Terraform scripts and understand the multitude of new concepts, while leaving actual software development of new modules/projects to contractors.

I went from a super happy and excited employee to hating my job. I simply cannot get excited about cloud and what I basically see as infrastructure/dev-ops work, while not being able to work on new, fun and exciting projects. I also cannot get excited about maintaining decades old systems that should have been superseded long ago.

Am I making a mistake? Cloud is the future, so should I be over the moon for having an opportunity to learn about it? Is production support for legacy apps + cloud = full stack? Alternatively - would it be reasonable for me to want to focus on .NET + Angular/React development instead? Is it reasonable for a developer to want to want to work on new shiny projects and not really wanting to deal with infrastructure? 

**TL;DR:** I want to work on API + front-end development and not deal with infrastructure. Is that reasonable? Am I wanting too much or missing out on essential cloud experience?

28,Super depressed career wise,"I'm currently working as a junior tester for a consultancy, currently placed at a large company. It's automated testing, but it's using the company's own framework. I feel very bored everyday, using their in house framework that I know is not used anywhere else and won't help me career-wise in the future. I'm trying to contribute to the framework by implementing new test steps (it's a BDD framework with implementation in .NET) to the framework, and luckily my pull requests of this got approved. However still it was just simple small contributions and most of my work remains just implementing the BDD steps they already got.

I don't know whether I'm being ungrateful for this job or legitimately feeling stuck, and need a third eye to judge. For judging purposes, I'm using Azure DevOps and run my tests in a pipeline, using git, and learnt a bit of .NET. I'm trying as a side project to build a web scraper and display the results in a web dashboard using Python, and learning c++ through following some online projects. But many times I get stuck, especially with c++ and don't know who to ask/how to ask because my question is so complicated. I'm 25, have a masters in mech eng but switched industry due to also being unskilled in that area (graduated with average gpa). Nowadays I feel depressed and just go to work browse reddit, instagram, do my side projects if I feel like it and do the bare minimum for work since it is enough.

39,Looking for a job and approached by an Avanade recruiter,"Let me start this out by saying that I am between jobs and as a result, I am a bit desperate for income as I am the primary income in my household (might as well be the sole income as my husband is on disability.)

&amp;#x200B;

My experience is with M365/Azure as an Admin/Engineer and Cloud Solutions Architect. My last job was a consulting company that had a similar model to Avanade with bench time, certs, 80% travel pre-covid, crazy hours, etc... but I was in a department where I did get to do hands-on execution of migrations in addition to the accounts where we were using the off-shore team. Most clients were complete nightmares, our off-shore teams were in either Poland or India &amp; difficult to get them to execute the migrations correctly without having to babysit them, and the work/life balance was a hot mess for people with medical issues. (I suffer from severe migraines and did not have enough time off to cover my dr appointments along with my sick days that could be between 0 and 5 in a month due to the migraines. I do qualify for Intermittent FMLA, but it only covered like 2 days a month at my old employer.)  The majority of the project managers were either completely incompetent on a tech level or were so stuck in their methods that they couldn't work well with those who don't use the same method (ie: Agile PM's couldn't work with Scrum {or felxable} architects) and put all the blame when things went wrong on the architects.

&amp;#x200B;

I was downsized due to too long on bench due to covid causing over-staffing, so this is a big fear for me with other consulting firms. 

&amp;#x200B;

The role that I was approached about is not within my normal wheelhouse, but instead is the direction I want to go in the future. This makes me want to look into it more, but I can't in good conscience put myself in a position where my mental health might suffer. I also have a big focus on schedule flexibility as I am going back to school (online classes with the ability to log in any time) and I need to have time to log in daily to classes without making myself sick due to lack of sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked at recent reviews of the company on Indeed and Glassdoor and I am completely at a loss for if I should seriously look at them, or if I should pass.

I applied to one of the jobs/internships that I'm pretty sure I am qualified for... here are the requirements:

0 to 2 Years of experience in the field of Information Technology.

✓ Knowledge in Object Oriented Programming is mandatory

✓ Programming skills in Java or C# or Ruby or JavaScript or Python would be an added

advantage

✓ Additional knowledge in any Testing Tools (e.g. Selenium) would also be an added

advantage.

I'm not going to lie, I am pretty comfortable with object-oriented stuff but we are currently learning Data Structures using Java in my programming fundamentals 3 class and I am not understanding it much at all. When I applied at the bottom it said to email the guy if I thought I met the requirements, so I emailed him along with a copy of my resume. About 3 hours later the guy emails me back and asks if I'm interested and if he can call me later. He calls me later and he pretty much offered me 50k with benefits. I was aware that this application was for n internship with a possible job opportunity but for him to call me and just offer me a job like that threw me off?

This Job fair thing was through my community college so I'm 90 percent sure it's not a scam. For the longest time, I've debated whether or not to go and transfer to a University because of debt (I'm going to have to get loans since I'm paying for my college) I eventually decided that the debt would be worth it in the end so I started applying to Universities like UTD and UT Austin. This job offer completely threw me off, I've always heard of people struggling to get job offers and internships so getting one this easy was a complete shock to me. I researched the company and they seem pretty legit, PM me if you want to know the name of the company because I'm not sure if I can give it out here.

I guess I'm wondering if you guys think 50k a year plus benefits is worth taking than going to University and being in debt. I also feel impostor syndrome hitting me hard right about now because I feel extremely underqualified considering I don't feel confident in my programming skills. I mean like I said OOP is fine but Data Structures is where I am not confident.

Recently I got an offer letter from a company, and i have 2 business days to give them a response. In the offer, it specifies that the type of employment is “at will”, meaning if either me or the employer wants to terminate the agreement, then we can do so. 

The problem is that I was just notified by Facebook that I passed their first interview and will be moving on to the final round. There is no way I will be able to interview and get a decision in 2 days from them, as I have to give the first company a response within that timeframe. Obviously I don’t want to miss an opportunity to work at Facebook, but I also do not want to reject my first offer in case I don’t get Facebook.

I was thinking that if I do end up getting Facebook, since the first company has employment “at will”, I can terminate my contract with them. However, I also have to sign a Non-compete agreement with the first company, which I am not too familiar with but suspect that it means I’m not allowed to interview with other companies, such as Facebook.

54,Infrastructure Engineer vs Software Engineer Internship,"I’m currently a sophomore in college and I’m deciding which internship to take for summer 2022. Both internships are at companies of similar size and prestige in the same industry (non tech). I’m wondering how much of a benefit having a job titled software engineer compared to infrastructure engineer will have for when I’m searching for a software engineer internship at a tech company next year. The infrastructure engineer position pays significantly more (about 1.5x), so if the position does not make that much of a difference, then I would likely take that internship. However, if having a software engineering internship (I would be working on an app dev team) would increase my internship marketability by a lot, then I would take the lower paying internship. I’m interested in what you guys think.",cscareerquestions,1637265607

56,Should I keep my DS major?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello! I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. I’m a college Jr, who is currently double majoring in history and data science. However, I’m considering dropping the data science major. I have had a few tech jobs outside of my coursework, and have some level of competence in web design, networking, troubleshooting/ computer maintenance, and I have a certification in cyber security. I’m hoping to go to law school/become a lawyer after college, potentially doing cyberlaw litigation or something similar. I don’t really see myself ever becoming a full-time data scientist. So, I’m considering dropping the major. I have a few reasons for doing so: 1. I really enjoy working with computers, but not particularly with data, I’m somewhat neutral on that front. 2. While my DS major is light on programming, I’ve never enjoyed nor done particularly well there. 3. As I’m going for law, I need to keep my GPA up, and DS will lead to more classes that I’d need to take, including some rather difficult ones. 4. My school has had difficulty retaining strong faculty in the department, and I’m more confident in the quality of my history education and even the experience with computers I have had outside of class. I don’t want to sound too negative about it though. I wonder if having the degree would set me apart, whether in law or just other jobs. Having data analysis as a “tool in my belt” has long been something that I wanted. I also wonder if having such a degree would be preferable on a resume, as history majors aren’t exactly known for their computer skills haha. I’m somewhat captivated by the potential of having the DS major.

So, here is what I really want to ask: How valuable will a DS BA (or potentially a minor instead) be for someone in my situation?",cscareerquestions,1637265398

I see the end result in the application GUI or its outputs but have a hard time understanding how the code all works and functions together. I know a big part of agile is understanding the relationships between components parts of the system and perhaps this is where I need to focus my attention.

But in a general sense how do you go about understanding someone’s repo? It is line by line where you copy and paste a line of their code into google to understand each individual part for example: django.template.backend. Or do you just look at the imports and try and make sense of those? I don’t have a starting point here,  even though I’ve worked with the language before I have a hard time deciphering another persons code and their logic and how all the pieces work together.

It was a medium-sized company hiring for a role similar to my recent role, and I felt like I'd done pretty well on the technical interview. We started the behavioral interview, and the guy interviewing me was really friendly and easy-going, and we started off with a pretty casual chat. He asked me questions about my past roles, a few fun questions like ""what kind of animal would you want to be"", and some typical questions about strengths and weaknesses. I think I said my weakness was my short attention span. At the end of the interview, I asked if he had any feedback. He immediately replied that I sounded arrogant, that I came off as really haughty and that it was off-putting for him. I thanked him for the honest feedback and we wrapped up the call, and the next morning I got their standard rejection email. I know the cocky, judgy, self-proclaimed genius is really common personality type in this field. I went to a school where it felt like half of the CS majors I knew were like that, and I guess I may have picked that up.

I have been super fortunate to have gotten two great internship offers for this upcoming summer.

I am curious to hear people's thoughts on which offer I should go with.

For the SWE internship at MongoDB, I can do back end, full stack, or front end. The location is in NYC. The company is medium-sized in terms of number of employees so I could connect with a lot of people at the company. I've also heard that the intern class ends up super tight knit which would be really nice. Since the company is smaller than Meta, I could also have a larger role with the work that I do.

For the internship at Meta, I only have the choice of front end. I'm happy to do front end work but I'm wondering if that looks as good on a resume as backend/full stack. Meta is a larger company which I have never experienced before. I also go to a relatively unknown school so it would be great to have Meta on my resume. I also think the work that goes on there is really cool. The location is in Menlo Park, but I can try to change location to NYC.

72,I am at my mid-30's who wanted to get back to software engineering,"I worked as a full-stack Java developer for 7 years since I graduated in around 2010. I am not from the US and the industry that I worked at mostly uses dated tech stacks:

\- The most advanced framework that I have been using is the spring framework and jQuery  
\- All their servers that I have used are on-premises  
\- There were no Agile at the time I worked there  
\- All applications are monolithic and no microservices

Yet I have been changed to work as a BI analyst in the past 3 years (still in the same industry, also using dated techs) and recently I have moved to Canada due to family issues and I need to look for a new job in this new environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer to work as a software engineer than as a BI analyst, but I have difficulties in finding either of the jobs. Most of the jobs in the market require candidates to have experience in microservices, cloud, agile, or at least some modern JavaScript framework. In addition, with my experience (total 10 years+), it is difficult for employers to consider me as a junior engineer (even I don't mind) and I don't have very much any of the experience required in the senior positions. Not to mention my previous job titles are xxx manager, but I have not much people management experience at all.

Title jump went from junior to senior level. I've already been given a business critical project that I'm the lead of, and I'm not sure that I can handle it. There are a million moving pieces and more keep being added.

I've been working ~60 hours a week just trying to keep up, and every day more responsibility gets put on my plate.

Most people will say that this is absolutely fine but maybe unethical, and that I will burn a bridge. Also most people tell me “companies do this all the time, they extend offers and change their minds.” So as a candidate I can do that too. 

But here’s my question: by reneging the way I did, am I not screwing over a person, or a specific manager rather than the whole company?

Sure, companies do this a lot and they look out for their best interests but at the end of the day, I didn’t screw over “The Company” by doing this…I screwed over my manager and the people who helped me in my current position. They are the people who will face the consequences, not necessarily the whole organization. That’s how I think of it, and that is where my feeling of guilt comes from.

Offer A is actually for the company I wanted to work for the most. However, the cost of living is so high and I'd be mostly on my own. If I take Offer B, my parents are willing to move there with me since we aren't happy where we live anymore. So I wouldn't have to pay for housing for Offer B and I have plenty of time to relocate, if it ever happens. Offer A is expecting immediate relocation from day 1. I currently live in a medium CoL area and was never interested in relocating to a high CoL area. Regarding the stocks for Offer A, the company is not a startup or one that I feel will really skyrocket in stock value since it's been around for a while. The stock did triple in value since the pandemic began, but it is still a low-cost stock (below $100). Therefore, I'm not really feeling like I'd pass up on much in the stocks.

I think the job prospects for Offer A would be slightly better since it is in the Bay Area and it is a slightly smaller, more selective tech company, but Offer B is still great to build a next opportunity from. I have no long term plans of moving to the Bay Area though, only maybe to try it for a few years.

97,VR Career Advice,"My background is in designing and programming AV systems. I've loved the work and the process of learning more, but the pandemic has changed me. I used to see myself helping people to have great meeting experiences with AV systems, but now the only meeting experience that I want to improve is the VR meeting experience. I see how it's going to change everything, and I want in!

I have ten years of experience designing AV systems as a consultant. I've had a good run of it. I also spent a lot of time building our company's Revit (3D/BIM) capabilities and programming some substantial projects in backwater AV languages - Lua would be the most widely known language. The programming work is roughly equivalent to full-stack development - lots of work getting owner buy-off on UCIs. The backend work is usually light scripting to command devices with simple protocols/APIs.

Before that, I took various CS coursework, so I took data structures, operating systems, databases, discreet math with exposure to C++, Java, SQL, PHP, and Python. As a kid, I was really into building websites: I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Photoshop for fun. I really like programming, and I'm good at it. Our company doesn't pitch ourselves first and foremost as a programming company, so the work we get isn't steady, and it's often cursed to function as a side gig. Performing difficult programming work while being shot at by architects for your 'day job' is a drag.

Quest introduced me to VR. I could never justify getting a powerful VR PC (2 kids take up all my free time outside work). However, I've decided that I can justify owning a powerful VR PC as long as I use it for mining when I'm not on it. It's working out wonderfully.

Now I'm ready to find my next career move. I'm toying with the idea of finishing up a master's program. My background is a BA in music, so my academic credentials are very meh. However, I thought more deeply: the masters would cost me \~$25k, three years, 15 hours per week. That is a shit load of effort and money for a generalized degree. I'm 38, so I feel the clock ticking. As much as I would like to prove that I can pass through the ring of fire, i.e., an algorithms course, I might do better just taking that class as a one-off and spending the rest of my time and money learning Unity, Unreal, C, Maya, Blender, 3dsmax.

My life's work has always been at the intersection of non-trivial technology and non-technical people. My wonderful Luddite wife keeps me grounded in this respect too. Maybe I don't need to aim to become a serious VR dev - maybe there's something available with less retraining necessary. Any insights are greatly appreciated!!",cscareerquestions,1637253634

1,I Did It. I Finally Found A Dream Position. No Internship Experience And Mid-30's Something Guy. Thank you for the help everyone!,"I feel this type of obligatory post for this subreddit, so here it is. A bit about myself, I returned to school for computer science in my 30's. I came from a healthcare background where I worked in the realm of physical therapy. I started school in 2018 and finished in 2021. Due to some circumstances, I could not get any internship experience, and I knew this was going to hinder me. 

The process was tedious. There were 400 or so job applications. 200 LC questions, which I actually enjoyed and will continue to do them.  I worked on three different side projects. I received plenty bunch of ""We love your personality/enthusiasm, but we need someone with more experience.""  I eventually reached a point of stopping caring, or I was numb to the generic email rejection. When I achieved that mindset, things were much more freeing.

In the last few weeks, I casually entertained the hiring process with different companies and attended career fairs. In one career fair, I had some was quick banter with someone, and I was invited for an interview a few days later.  After that, I offered me an SRE position. I conditionally accepted it. They said it's fully remote, FT, full benefits, and unlimited PTO. There is room for me to move laterally and vertically. 

They asked about my salary range, and I said I'd need to get back to them since I didn't research this topic much. After some research and discussion with other people in the field, I concluded on $80000 - $85000. They agreed.

A couple of days later, I got another call from a company that I interviewed with, and they offered me a $100000 full-stack role, but they have a hybrid working model. I asked them to give me a few days to decide. 

With the help of this subreddit,  with the notion, ""It is okay to ask for more money. "" I decided that I would ask for a small salary bump from the original company. I asked them for $92500, to which they agreed.

Yes, I know this isn't FANG money, but I don't care. The position is entirely remote, with good benefits and good PTO. Furthermore, with no internship experience, I'd be a bloody fool to say no.

The silly thing about this whole interview process for this company. . .I wasn't asked a single LC question.",cscareerquestions,1637252872
2,6 months into my first dev job and alarms are blaring,"Bootcamp grad here 6 months into my first role as a full stack developer and things are... not great. Dev team here consists of me, the ceo, and a team of 5 offshore devs. When I first started up I immediately noticed a lot of architectural decisions that made me scratch my head and wonder why things were being done this way. I asked questions and got to know the product and now 6 months later I'm really worried. What I at first thought was my own inexperience with enterprise level programming and this language (I had learned for a month up to starting the role) has been revealed to actually be a horrendously architected platform. Basic tenets of oop aren't being followed, almost no accepted language conventions are being followed, and we use this weird combo of mvc/ mvvm. It's a mess. What should be a straightforward CRUD part of the app has multiple methods called ""edit"", with one of them actually acting as the update method. We have one god model that every other part of our project is based on. All of this was giving me significant pause, but what really put the nail in the coffin was when we hired an actual experienced dev. He is consistently blown away by the incompetency with which this project was architected. He gets very heated and actually ends up shouting at our CEO, who wrote a lot of the code himself. He's barely been here a couple of months, but I can tell he's already at his breaking point. I don't know what to do as this is my first job. I wanted to try and learn everything I can from the new experienced guy, but I don't see him staying here much longer. In fact I worry about the longevity of the company itself.

10,Variation on common career path Q,"Hello all - lot's of details so I will attempt to distill, but may fail.  Just looking for opinions from folks in the field - will be cross posting for max exposure so apologies for any redundancy.

I'm 33, been on my own since 16 and have been working poor my whole life.  I'm married - no kids yet but would like to be able to within 5 years.   Have mostly worked labor/service jobs, some ""higher level"" customer service, but now due to 3 months and counting of debilitating long haul virus symptoms I have no choice but to start making moves to stay afloat, although I've already felt this way for years.  These are important details to mention to describe the sense of urgency on my part.  

Been to college twice and had to drop both times for work.  Enjoyed it a lot and did fairly well so I always wanted to go back, but I am loan shy for obvious reasons.  I'm not sure how many (if any) of those credits will transfer but I'm looking into it.  I now have a potentially once in a lifetime opportunity to get state funding for a degree (still need to determine eligibility for the program), and I can't afford to f- this up if it pans out. 

Out of all the programs I've narrowed it to 3 - a one year accelerated general associate's (with intentions to transfer to a four year degree), two year software development associate's degree through a highly respected tech school (with the same intentions), and a four year bachelor's in human services from an established state university.  The program is limited to what degrees it will pay for, and these are the best options I could find.  So here's the rub:

I've always avoided tech fields due to the fact that math hasn't ever come naturally to me.  That's not to say I can't do it - it may just take more time and effort but once I get it I really *get it.*  Digging into the computer science realm, the more I see the more exciting it looks; it would be a challenge but also something interesting/fun for once, and a much more potentially lucrative and marketable skill than I've ever had before.  I'm still not sure which direction within the field would be the best fit for me.

The life I've lived has given me natural skills that would be highly translatable to a human services field like social work/counseling, along with a bit of a bleeding heart.  I did entry level volunteer work for two years which burned me out entirely (am still learning skills to deal with that more effectively though), and was disenchanted with the bureaucracy, unethical practices and straight up fraud within that realm (I'm fully aware of its pervasiveness throughout all industries - facts of life, but it's particularly bad when the direct ""in your face"" cost is human lives and increased suffering).  I would still rather have a career like that to fall back on than say, dishwashing/cooking at a restaurant, customer service etc. (no offense to service jobs, I'm just over it).

The fact is I would like to pursue both disciplines *if possible* to minimize my chances of ever needing to flip another burger or stock another shelf.  That is the goal.  I see a lot of potential in either case and am not really asking about which is better.  There are pro's and con's to both and I have considered many, such as outsourcing/saturation, automation, burn out potential, recession survival etc.  I also see that the world changes so fast nowadays so time is of the essence, and I don't have any safety net to speak of if things go sideways.  I still haven't found a crystal ball, but I've watched the tides' steady rise for decades and need the best boat I can get.  

**Does it matter to people hiring in the CS industry what my bachelor's degree is actually in, so long as I have one and am able to do the work?**  I've seen a lot of success stories from self taught programmers, and thought if I could teach myself during school along with doing my best to take extra math classes or (minor in CS if the program allows), join programming clubs and do projects at school/on my own, The Odin Project and the like - would it matter that it was not an actual CS degree?  I've also seen people say that not having at least a 4 year degree has been a direct hindrance in being considered for many positions.  *I wouldn't consider the human services degree if it wasn't free*, but it would be nice to have for career mobility.  I also realize that it may be problematic for me to pursue a master's in CS if that was something I wanted to do later on.  

The associates or tech degree would be a good pathway to a bachelor's in CS but it's hard to pass up a free $45k degree.  I realize it would be preferable for me to just ""pick one"" but as I said, this isn't really that cut and dry IMO.  I can't afford to f- up but I also can't afford to waste years of my life, since even if I do get the free degree I would possibly need to supplement income with loans *and* work at least part time.  I realize it would be difficult to effectively teach myself computer science while doing all that, but the objective would be to throw myself into it with the vigor of a drowning man.

I am currently looking for a new job. I have working in my current job for about 10 months as a Software engineer. This is my first job where I am working on design and development of the software. I took this job , because I needed the job during the pandemic, and my thought was ' at-least it will pay my bills for now '. 

Before this I was working in technical support for 2 years. 

Whenever I apply for a job , I get interview calls , but the problem is , I am only getting interview calls for mid senior roles now. Recruiters / HR consider my 2 years of tech support as a work experience and push me for mid senior roles.

The problem here is that in 2 years of my tech support I have learned nothing , have not even written one line of code. It was more like fixing network issues for enterprise customers ( and that too , it was mostly related to old switches and routers ( contract TAC engineer ) ) .

Recently, I went to an interview and this guy just ripped me apart. I had no idea about how RabbitMQ works , no idea about how AWS VPC is to be configured , had to idea how to design system and all. This has happened multiple times and I feel that , interviewer tend to focus less on LC and more on design + development as you move senior in role. ( might be wrong here ) . 

I don't think I am yet qualified for a job that needs me to design system and all. I need a more junior level jobs , where I get to design small feature, handle tests , fix bugs ( you know the kind of things a person with 10 months of experience does ) 

Should I remove that 2 years of experience from my resume ? Will I still get interview calls for a more junior role ? I am not sure what to do , if I keep that I get senior role jobs , if I remove that , I would probably not get an interview call ? 

Or , shall I just , keep applying + preparing for mid level jobs in the meantime. I am thinking it will take me about 6 months of preparation to get basics right about AWS + system design etc.

29,How do you feel with setup-to-fail scenarios? Is my only option to jump ship?,"Currently working at a large org, and interesting daily with some very senior individuals. These seniors have some big ideas data science an tech wise, however they won't (or can't) provide the tools needed to do the job. 

Instead of accepting that this, they seems to direct there anger/disapproval towards me and other team members. The company works in a highly regulared environment and the IT teams have strick rules. As a dev there is little I can do to influence the wider company, and belive me I gave tried.

For example: Directors come to me with their idea, I explain what would need to be in place and get to work reaching out across the company to try and get things in place. I hit road block after roadblock. These blockers are often other directors saying no you can't have that tool, or you can't have access to that data. 

I return to the directors asking for new dev work and explain the blockers. But they are not interested in dealing with assisting with the blockers, or talkimg to tge other directors, instead demanding that I get it done, or end up being extremely condescending.

The teams are horizontally divided so, there is constant ball passing, finger pointing which affects deadlines, work, etc. Stakeholders are so busy that they dont have 15 mins to discuss improvements nor do they seem interested. Their approach is most like ""dont fix it if aint broke"". Since they have capital (which is not unlimited) they are laid back and just throws money at problems in terms of hires, delays, downtimes, etc. IMO, this is not going scale as the company grows.

3. Stay with company A, then reapply or hit up Company B again to expedite the interview process for whenever I finish company A's internship duration

54,May 2021 Grad trying to find way back,"Hi everyone! Not really sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really wanted advice on how to move forward with my life in terms of my career. (First few paragraphs are about me and a little more insight to why I was feeling the way I'm feeling so feel free to skip to the last paragraph to see my questions)

So just some background for myself, I graduated in May 2021 with a degree in CS but COVID hit me really hard mentally. Several of my closest family members died and it really hit me hard. It really doesn't help that I'm one of those people that coasted through school and never went out of my way to try things out. (Yes this means I never went out of my way to look for internships) Yeah I made some projects just for fun, but it's just simple projects. For example, some projects made by just using Java's Swing GUI. I never once learned on what React, Docker or whatever these employers are looking for. I only really knew how to code in Python, Java, and a little of C. 

Once I graduated, I did apply to about 20 places (Yeah, rookie numbers I know..) and have around 3 places actually calling me back. I was really fresh to how interviewing work so I passed the initial phone screening for all of them pretty much. I was moreso surprised about all the technical interviews that followed. Like I said before, I only really knew core concepts and probably the basics of coding in Python, Java and C. I even had a technical interview that I bombed and I'm pretty sure it was pretty easy as they only asked how to work with exceptions and what static was in Java (Stuff that I didn't do in my last year so I completely forgot). Then I found about this subreddit and I see people that have been Leetcoding (Would you guys believe that I never knew about Leetcode before coming here?) for months and here I am thinking that I can find a job with the basics. 

So with all that paired up with what happened to my immediate family, I just took a break for a couple months. Weak I know, but I really needed this break as how hard COVID hit my family and the realization of how different the industry is from school really made me mental quite close to breaking.

So now we come to November, where I am feeling a lot better so I'm finally back to applying. I've started looking into Leetcode and embarassingly it takes me around 30 minutes to solve one Easy problem. I'm trying to review questions that I bombed that one time (how exceptions work and what static is). Obviously a 6 month break really rusts up my coding skill (Not like I had anything impressive) but I feel like I'm getting back to the gist about it. I'm also going to eventually start to try and develop my own website if that's within my skillset.

So here are my questions. Did I screw up by taking the 6 month break I did? Not like I regret it since I feel a lot better but will employers be asking what I did? Also, like I said before, I only really know how to do trivial code in Python, Java, and a little bit of C. Yeah, I completed some projects with them, but nothing too amazing. Probably the best thing I made was a mobile app on Android Studio with Java. But other than that, I feel like I know nothing. Even simple data structures and algorithm questions, I completely forgot but I have been reviewing them little by little.",cscareerquestions,1637223851

56,Should I quit now to switch to this completely remote opportunity?,"I graduated earlier this year. And upon graduation, I was so scared of being unemployed I applied everywhere. After months of job searching, when I finally got an out-of-state offer at company A, I just straight up accepted it. Good thing is, company A has been super chill. I feel like I have ownership of my projects and the deadlines are flexible. However, by the spring of next year, company A will want to move me out of state to where the company is located and I don't want to move there because my significant other is still working in my hometown. I really only just took that offer at company A because I wanted a job at that time, even when I do enjoy the work now.

Now, I am presented with another opportunity. This opportunity pays around 5K more and is permanently remote. However, the company does seem interesting... It has almost 1000 employees but only 3 data scientists supporting the entire company, and they are seeking the 4th... which I am a candidate of. They described themselves as desperately seeking an additional resource and have been searching for it ""quite a while"". It also has a 5-decade long company history and went through multiple rebranding of its company name. I am really tempted by the permanently remote opportunity but am afraid of quitting my current job.

I am not very dependent on pay, but I am on bed managed project and they don't want to pay OT even we work long hours and are saying there are no money selected for OT so we should do all work in 8 hours even though it's not possible. 

I had a talk with my career cancelour about salary, but he said he can offer only 20% raise to my initial pay max due to internal rules.

I eventually got a full time position, things were looking up, but I was just too rusty/overwhelmed by a complex system and there was almost zero support. My contractual term completed and that was that. I didn't get permanent, but they didn't have any real issues with my work quality or output. We left on fine terms.

Pandemic hit and I did some more freelance, just subsistence level basic stuff. Didn't improve, didn't do much. Didn't care to.

I'm not really sad or depressed. I'm usually either in good spirits or neutral. I just don't feel motivated or very interested in anything.

3. My current TC is \~$50k with all possible benefits (even legal!). From what glassdoor says prospective company pays $21-29/hr to interns + overtime. Idk about benefits yet. I can just assume that I will make more at the prospective company.
4. At my current job I work about 5-10 hrs/week. Prospective employer's recruiter promised 40-60 hr weeks. I don't mind that, especially since 40-50% of it is travel. Might actually save up for a MS.
5. I am in the Bay Area, and I so far I couldn't break into tech (graduated May 2020). Last year I burned out after 600 applications, 10-12 phone screens, 6 first rounds, 3 second rounds, 1 onsite and being ghosted afterwards (I would like to call out Quizzlet for this bullshit). Also had an offer which I wouldn't consider in my worst nightmares. This year I just started applying, but my callback rate isn't good at all. This job actually might be my chance.
6. Am I going to lose my foundation in non-ML machine vision I've built up in the past two years if I switch over to this position?
7. My current employer isn't kicking me to the curb any time soon, but I know that I have to move on at some point (kind of a dead end career-wise). Internship is 3 months, with a potential 9 month extension, and then conversion to FT. Recruiter promised high conversion rate.

85,Career Switch from Oil &amp; Gas Industry to Dev.," 

Hi All,

I have about 6 years of combined experience in the Process Automation industry Specifically in the Oil &amp; Gas sector, and currently 30 years old.  
As I work on legacy systems, my exposure has been limited to VB6, VB.net, SQL/Mongo and for now Python but not as a full-fledged Software Developer. I do build internal solutions but have never done something massively used such as e-commerce/web apps etc. 

I intend to shift to the Software Development sector, and currently investing about 6 hours a day apart from my 12-hour work schedule to learn, prepare and create projects around standard tech stacks as well as re-learning DSA in deep on weekends.   
However, in my personal opinion, and the overall feedback that I got from my company as well as when asked by different developers, I am good at Backend development. but pretty much no experience in the Web front end, unlike desktop applications.  


**My 2 major questions are -:** 

**1)** I just wanted to know if it is possible to transition from Oil n Gas sector to IT Sector at this age? or it is too late for such a career switch? The reason for such transition is the saturation in my field and the work has become monotonous, and feel no better ways to transition to good work.

  
**2)** What should be the focus of the area if my interest is towards backend engineering specifically APIs and Microservices?

Offers:  
1. SWE intern for a startup in NYC. They've grown a lot in the past couple years.  
2. Data Science intern for an older tech company in the Bay area.

Career-wise I'd like to work more in data science/ML engineering. I've done a couple internships in data science. I don't experience in SWE (besides taking a class in it next semester and basic software development), but I'm interested in exploring it before I graduate. However, I'm worried that if I do SWE next summer and then look for data science/ML jobs in the fall it'll look bad or be a step back career-wise.

On the other hand, the tech company has name-brand recognition, but I didn't do any technical interviews for the position. The team I'd work for is really small, and I got the impression that they don't have many well defined projects. However, I'd be doing stuff that's more aligned with what I'd like to work in after graduating.

94,Morally conflicted about working for big tech,"I’m a senior in college studying CSE. I’m about to start applying for jobs and ever since I was a freshman I dreamed of working for a FAANG company. I had many different reasons, I wanted to work alongside the smartest devs, use new tech, work on most challenging problems, learn from the most experienced people, and make lots of money. 

The problem is that over the last 5 years I have begun to absolutely detest companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. I don’t agree with their business practices and I hate the negative consequences of their products. They quite literally run the world, and have massive implications for the economy, for politics, for culture, etc. I hate Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, and the other people like them who lead these companies. I could go on and on, but the point is I don’t think I could ever work for them without feeling like I’m a hypocrite, but it sure seems like the best way to get all of the things I listed above is to do just that. 

I want to work for a company that gives me all of those things, but has REAL human beings leading them. As cliche as it sounds, I want to work for a company that wants to make the world a better place and wants to move humanity forward, not just generate profit. Is this hopeless to wish for?

Fast forward this year, I've decided to do co-op.  Didn't get very lucky with Software Developer interviews (I even had one for Amazon) but got an offer for an SRE role at a highly reputable company. It is fully remote which is also pretty cool.

Originally it was 4-month term, but I asked if it was possible to extend when the term ends since I wouldn't be able to complete my final term until 12 months later anyways (this is due to the way the courses are available and becaue I only have one semester remaining.

I do love to code, and took this on due to the automation aspects of the job.    However, I believe I would mainly like to code, if I get an exciting development role.  My question is, how difficult would it be to move onto a development role after finishing the co-op term and graduating?  

I am sort of safe because the term would end and I would return to school for a semster, but I also realize I won't have opportunity to do other co-op work during the 12 months.  In case a software development co-op opportunity came.

2,"Just got out of my second cubital tunnel surgery, don't be me (9 YOE)","**TL/DR:** If you start losing feeling in your arms, that's downstream of being a programmer and inflaming your forearms holding your hands in a cocked position.  Which then compresses the nerves etc etc etc.  And then you don't do anything about it for a year and a half and then you get to have a surgeon move some nerves around.  Woops!

So do something about it ***yesterday***.  

**Longer version:**

In 2019, I started losing feeling in my hands and suffering severe and ongoing forearm pain from an inflamed common extensor tendon in both hands.  My right mouse hand was worse.  In late 2019, I started doing the process of getting it looked at and then had to stop when COVID hit. 

So at home, I stretched, stopping using trackpads (I have an M705 on every surface I will ever use my laptop on, you're welcome), and shifted over to either the Newtral Mouse or, no joke, the [Cutesy Beanie Baby](https://www.amazon.com/TY-Beanie-Baby-CUTESY-Dog/dp/B015EV60HG/) as a wrist rest on my main dev box.  

And then in early 2021 once I had managed to get my shot, I gave in and went to PT which made things even worse in general and \*great\* for 2-3 hours following every appointment.  Dry Needling is legit.  And then we gave up and went to surgery.  The right hand in August, the left hand at 7AM EST this morning.  

The problem is that the swollen tendon would trap the nerve so when I bent the elbow, my ulnar nerve wrapped around the elbow and stretched out.  And then it got super-swollen, so it was even bigger and even when we got the forearm to (sorta) go down, it made things worse.  And the resulting surgery is to literally pull it up on the side of the elbow with some slack so it never needs to stretch. 

I can't say it's perfect, I'll probably get 9.3 fingers back at any time and it's really really sensitive to vibration so long drives are no bueno and I'll probably wear either elbow pads or compression sleeves for the rest of my life.  But it's a massive improvement especially as I keep working on my tight forearms. 

**So your todos today:** 

1. Ask yourself about numbness, tingling, or lack of fine motor control in your hands
2. Stretch, massage, Theraband, and rest.  Hammer stretches for wrist rotation, table stretches for the wrist ROM, door stretches just in case your compression is in the shoulders (I had a touch, that \*did\* respond well to PT also known as grabbing a door and leaning forward for 3-5 minutes at a time).  For massage, foam rolling is good, getting someone to pull up a wooden rolling pin for baking and roll out the tops of your forearms is even better.  5 minutes a side every day.  
3. If you need help, go get it early.  The idea with PT is to work the muscles so they heal stronger and better but if you're at the surgery point, this'll knock out all remaining feeling in your hands when it makes all your problems worse.  
4. Completely related, dry needling looks ridiculous and is amazingly effective.  I might go out to a PT in a few months and try another round or 17 twice a week just to get the forearms loose again.    
5. It's not a bad surgery if you get that far.  I'd say a couple weeks to 90% of OG typing speed, a couple months to full strength.  FWIW, I'm following Lyle McDonald's injury diet and it does seem to work (You.... do not understand what enough protein is.)
6. Noting that I love WFH, having two setups and also an hour (or four, see ""I love WFH"") of commuting to at least put your wrists in another position and a distinction between your work and home setups might be a big part of the reason this took so long to get so bad.

5,"Manager will ask me about my career plans, don't know what to answer!","So, my background: 2 years in the current company. Position is software engineer II for our data platform, which basically means data engineer. Earlier this quarter I was promoted to this position from SWE I. I had been working towards this position for a while, and after long (and also with a good bunch of support from my manager) I managed to get the promotion.

Now, my manager wants to ask me about my career plans. And to be perfectly honest, I have no idea. Partially because I have been ramping up in this position and taking bigger and more complex tasks, but also because I honestly have no idea what I want to do in the future, and I haven't really been thinking a whole deal about this.

Some considerations:

* I am not interested in management. Too big of a responsibility and I don't really want to move away from tech. This only means that senior and up positions are what I should be seeking for.
* I am not 100% sure I want to stay within data. Let me be clear: I am absolutely enjoying doing this. I feel I'm learning a great deal about a lot of stuff. Sadly, it's slowly starting to become the same as time goes by. Writing pipelines was challenging the first 50 times, but it's becoming repetitive, and that's a DE's bread-and-butter task.
* On the other hand, the bigger challenges I can see myself facing is to actually be able to translate business requirements into an actual, usable solution, and right now I need more business-savvy colleagues (manager included) to help me get some things straight, such as particularly complex queries or data sources that are not obvious.
* Technology is also rather repetitive. It's always some data storage, some ETL/ELT tool, a message broker, and data warehousing. Add in batch/streaming concepts, Hadoop, and some knowledge of microservices and computing and you have a decent stack already. And I feel there are increasingly less things to learn.
* I moved away from backend engineering because I also felt the work was repetitive (take some task, translate that into some form of API and data processing, rinse and repeat).
* Frontend does not interest me in the least. I understand it has its own complexities, but I already know I hate writing HTML and trying to make things pretty just because someone else thought it was a good design.

Ultimately though, I have no idea what I want to do in the future, and that includes continuing being a data engineer. And I have no idea what to tell my manager when the time comes. I have about 2 weeks to think of a good answer, so I can still sleep on any decisions or at least anything that comes to my mind.

The other day, I asked him in our 1:1 if I'm on pace to meet that improvement. He said no. This would make my job security appear at risk.

On the other hand, there's this form he has to fill out every 6 months and that form has a check box that asks if the employee is needing improvement. If that button is pressed, I get put on a PiP I assume. Well he filled out the form that other day and didn't press the button.

quoting from [here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/the%20rise%20and%20rise%20of%20the%20global%20balance%20sheet%20how%20productively%20are%20we%20using%20our%20wealth/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-nov-2021-full-report_final.pdf):

&gt;Strikingly, net worth is still mostly tangible. While investment in intangible assets has grown relative to investment in tangible assets in many countries when broadly measured, under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence. On paper, intellectual property products make up less than 4 percent of global net worth and real assets. Intangibles do, however, generate economic returns. The OECD reported in 2015 that intangible assets had expected returns of 24 percent, the highest rate among produced asset categories.

my first question is specific. **what does this sentence mean**: ""under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence."" **what are you investing in, when you invest in google, if not in the value of its intellectual property?** i realize google has not been around for very long, in the grand scheme of things, but it would be quite a surprise if it weren't still a major player in five years, no?

now my questions start to get vague.

if you read someone like buffett or sam altman, you leave thinking that only productive things are valuable (buffett likes a sure linear function; altman likes a possible exponential function), but that is obviously in some sense absurd, not just because valuable things are also valuable, but also because it is not at all clear that there is a clear distinction between things that are valuable for being productive and those that are valuable for having a personal canon of historical value. (indeed, altman does make caveats for land, even at the crescendi of his [hymn to productivity](https://moores.samaltman.com/).) again, from the mckinsey report:

&gt;The global economy has undergone a vast transformation over the past two decades, as rapid technological progress including digitization has taken hold and investment in intangible assets has soared. Yet over this same period, global wealth has grown largely as a result of the rising value of household real estate, a historical store of value

my rough read (very possible that this is not just a simplification, but downright inaccurate) is that they (mckinsey) basically attribute this discrepancy to loose monetary policy — i.e., it has been, on average, easier to increase net worth by taking out a loan, buying a tangible/valuable thing, and paying off that loan, than by buying an intangible/productive thing.

**but then why are all the largest companies in the world precisely those that principally (?) own intangible/productive things (tech)?**

i read [something](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/) recently that includes a lemma (see the ""Scratching the surface"" section), referencing another [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3667309), to the effect that the housing valuations in 2008 were in some sense *not* inflated, insofar as the run-up basically amounted to an increasingly accurate assessment, on the demand side, of the intrinsic (even *productive*) value of living in certain properties.

i think the best tl;dr, here, is that i am becoming increasingly suspicious of the distinction, which seems pervasive (especially the higher up you go in the intellectual totem pole), between speculation, on the one hand, and investment in productive/technological assets, on the other.

not really done with this, but [no one gives us any time any more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnokW3Mw24), so i'm just going to post it and make edits/clarifications later.",cscareerquestions,1637199628

25,Junior Transitioning From Midwest To Bay Area Tech?,"So quick background: I grew up in Northern California and graduated with a B.S. in CS from a small state school in mid 2020 with an internship at a start up and a research project with a big lab under by belt. I was doing work for my family's company up until May of this year when I (foolishly) took an underpaid developer position in the suburban Midwest and have been wanting to claw my eyes out ever since... The company is reputable in the area and the work environment is nice but I find my self doing very little coding and the pay and location are driving me nuts.  


I want to move to the urban Bay Area as a developer. Badly. I'm just wondering what the best way to make that transition would be? Since I know everyone will say this: **yes, I have been applying to jobs out there.** The point of this question is trying to know what the best strategy for someone with my level of experience and situation is. Would it be worth quitting this job to go back to working with family again so I can be closer to the Bay? The down side would be I wouldn't be getting paid as much (since family) and the company is even more no-named and a lot smaller than this one, but I can live with my folks and I would be doing more relevant work since I'd actually be coding frequently again. I'm looking to be completely out of here within the next year as a time window.

32,"When you practice leetcode, do you use “shortcuts”?","I am noticing that a lot of solutions in Python3 for leetcode or similar type problems, often contain shortcuts, i.e.:

A solution that is recursive with memo, simply using `@lru_cache` instead of actually implementing the cache or even just declaring `mem={}`.

Perhaps more blatantly, a solution for the “merge two intervals” problem that I’ve seen posted, uses `list.sort()` method. Well.... That’s most of the solution. The Nlog(N) solution is to sort the list of intervals, and then walk through them. The sort is obviously the most algorithmic part, and requires a little bit of brains, since you have to decide based on the data, will you quicksort? Bubblesort? Mergesort?

35,Started a new job 2 weeks ago and just heard back from a larger company - background check questions,"I'm not in CS but in a similar engineering field for about 10 years. I finally heard back from a large company that I interviewed with over a month ago. Unfortunately my timing was terrible - I was wrapping up interviews with a startup around that time. I had warned the larger company of my competing offer, but was told there wasn't much they could do. I ended up signing the competing offer but gave them a few more weeks until my start date, hoping that I could hear back before I start.

I heard nothing back and I ended up starting at the startup about 2 weeks ago, and it hasn't really been how I quite expected it. It's probably my fault for not vetting them out well enough, but I haven't been enjoying my time here. 

So finally after all this, a few days ago I hear back from the larger company and they want to move forward with an offer!! I'm super excited because it actually sounds like an amazing opportunity and I had my hopes up.

I went ahead and signed the offer. I know it's terrible to leave a company so soon after starting, but it happens sometimes and this feels like a once in a career move.

This whole time I haven't mentioned to the large company that I've already started with the startup, I just told them I had a competing offer I was waiting on and that I was still working with my previous employer on a contracting basis (which is true, I contract with them very infrequently but still ongoing).

I'm about to fill out a background check for the larger company since I just signed the offer. If I don't put down this startup that I just joined would there be any way of them finding out? Would that instantly disqualify me for some reason? And if I do include them on the background check, would that raise red flags that I didn't tell them up till now about this experience?

41,How to approach when leveraging another offer for a raise.,"I am paid way way WAY under what I should be at my current company. Even though they hired me straight out of college without any internships, for someone with a bachelor's in computer science from an ABET engineering program, 45k was way too low in a medium cost of living city. 

After 5 months, I emailed my boss telling him about my dire financial situation. That once they resume federal student loans, i flat out won't be able to afford my rent. My boss told me that there's nothing hr can do until 6 months which is my provisional period. But after that, at best I could expect a 5-6% raise to keep with inflation. He DID however authorize me for overtime since i'm non-exempt. If i worked all 15 hours of overtime i'm allowed weekly, I can get up to 75 thousand a year. But of course i'm also working more than full time if I do that. 

He explained to me at length that him, his boss, and even his boss's boss were aware of how little I was being compensated but that hr is a nightmare. I work for the 3rd largest employer in my state and its tangentially related to education and has a lot of public funding. 

So they have this formula they use to calculate compensation, and they have a salary range and they won't hire someone above the midway of that range blah blah blah. 

Well that conversation was last week and I started working overtime this week. And this morning I got an offer working somewhere else as a software engineer (rather than my paltry ""programmer 2"" title here). The offer is for 65 thousand a year 40 hours. Its a contract position. So i'd be working for a large pharmaceutical company that you've definitely heard of, but my actually ""hirer"" would be this small staffing company. 

The obvious answer is ""just take the new job"". But I like my current job. something tells me I won't like this new one. I have SO much flexibility at my current job. GREAT benefits, amazing relationship with my boss (he specifically crafts tasks to help me grow and get better experience). And its 5 minutes from where I live. If I can keep this job, I want to. Also this staffing firm is a place i'd never heard of, seems very VERY small (the president of the company has been emailing me personally) and it kinda sketches me out.

But I think that now that someone else is offering me 20,000 more a year and a more impressive title, I think that might factor into hr's calculations. 

I want to approach my boss without sounding like i'm trying to blackmail my company or anything. 

Currently I'm thinking ""hey, remember that stuff you were telling me about hr and how their compensation rules follow this contrived formula they came up with? Do you think it would factor in anywhere if I was getting a job offer with much higher pay? Well funny story..."". 

Also, if I tell him I have a job offer, its going to obviously alert him that I was applying elsewhere. I don't want this to be taken as a sleight. 

How should I approach this?",cscareerquestions,1637193739
42,Does repeating question provide a benefit or stunt growth?,"I was wondering what the general consensus is for repeating a problem on Leetcode is. More often than not I am repeating questions.

It's all fun, and I feel like I am learning a lot but.. at what point am I memorizing a question instead of a pattern?

Sometimes I redo a question 4 times, because I keep forgetting to do some sort of ""trick"" that is applied to that question. For example, forgetting that I should reverse through a for loop using the two pointer method, but not forgetting that I have to use the two pointer method for this problem.

So am I stunting my growth by repeating questions often? I do 3 questions a day but that includes redoing questions so there will be days I spend purely redoing questions I did last week instead of trying out new questions.

I was able to finally pull the code base to my local machine last week and the code base looks overwhelming and badly documented. I’ve asked my manager and other coworkers to provide any documentations that can help me understand the application or the architecture better but they don’t have any documentation and thinks the best way to learn is code.I’m not sure if that’s the actual process in other companies to help new developer get familiar with the application and the code base. My manger has given me couple of small stories to look into to improve the performance of the application and fix some bugs but I still don’t understand the application or the code base properly.

57,Afraid my CS degree will go to waste,"I graduated with a CS degree from a good school (University of Pittsburgh) in April 2020. When I graduated I felt I wasn’t ready to apply for jobs because I barely passed my classes and had to repeat several of them, didn’t have any internships or personal projects outside of school projects, mainly because I was working 40+ hours a week in a restaurant to pay my bills. So I kept working menial jobs while I occasionally studied and refreshed on things like DS and Algorithms.

Now that it’s been a year and 4 months since graduating I’m starting to panic that I’ll never get a dev job. I keep applying places but hear nothing back. The one company I got two interviews with for separate associate software developer positions that turned out to be tester jobs, but I didn’t even get an offer for those. 

The first one was my fault because I was thrown off when the interviewer told me it was actually a testing job and I pretty much told him I was looking for a dev job, not a tester. 

The second one I thought was actually a developer job (that’s what the posting said) but it turned out to be a tester job as well but I acted like I was still interested. The lady then started grilling me on what I’ve been doing for the last year and a half and how something must be wrong with me if I can’t get a job with a CS degree in this hot market. I told her I’d been refreshing my data structures etc and talked to her about my capstone project (a group project that was an Android medication tracker app). Then she told me that I was lazy and they’re looking for motivated people. In the back of my head I was thinking I worked 40-60 hour weeks slaving away at manual labor while getting a CS degree and commuting, and your take away from that is that I’m lazy?! And this was just for a junior testing position, where I know this company routinely hires 3 month boot camp grads from that barely understand Java.

I got the call yesterday that I actually got the gig, after passing through the interview process which surprisingly had no tech interviews. Only behavioral and then one where I “explained” what my skill set is rather than a performance.

From the looks of it, this internship seems to be more geared towards infosec on the business side rather than cyber security on the tech side.

I’m definitely going to accept the offer seeing as how I have nothing else planned or on the table this summer. But my question is, does it sound like this will still be worth it? I figured an internship is an internship. But wanted some second opinions. Thanks guys.",cscareerquestions,1637187228
62,New grad bloomberg vs squarespace?,"Details:

* Both in NYC
* Pay is about the same for first year, but bloomberg is higher after the first year. I'm not sure if pay after first year matters since I feel like I would jump to another company in nyc after a year to learn more
* Bloomberg I get to choose the team I'm on (internal job fair or something)

As a new grad, I just want to learn as much as possible and have good WLB. One thing I'm concerned about is the stigma against bloomberg of not being a tech company and not having enough transferrable skills, but i'm not sure how legit of a critique that is. My plans for the future aren't really solidified but here are some possible long term goals I have in mind:

* Master's degree in CS, focused on ML/personalization maybe
* A job with in tech with interesting work - specifically one that is related to both swe and math, so maybe a team at a tech company working with ML or a HFT company? not too sure yet..
* Good WLB :)",cscareerquestions,1637187027

66,New CS Student Jitters,"Hi all, a little background about myself is that I was a business student for 3 years and recently switched to CS because I had no aspirations in business. Nearing the end of my first semester in CS and I am really enjoying it, it’s obviously more difficult and time consuming compared to business but I could not be more happy with my decision. 

I really just want some advice on what I should be doing in my free time to get ready for internships/Jobs as I plan on graduating spring of 2023. My programming skills are amateur at best and I want to be able to stand out more. 

Some questions I also have:

1. Is it worth it for me to go to job fairs with basically no experience other than school? 

2. How much experience is optimal to be able to get a job/internship after graduating? I would like to get an internship the summer after I graduate.

3. Is it bad that I feel as if I am horribly behind and “dumber” than my classmates? I know I basically just started my path and CS is not an easy major, I just feel like I’m out of my league sometime

4. How difficult is it to really find a job/internship? This community is frightening me with the horror stories on how hard it is to find work after graduation. I would hate to go through school and not being able to get a job. 

Thank you in advance for the help. Just a very scared student trying to figure out is new path and any advice/expertise would be a god send.",cscareerquestions,1637184774

69,Sweating small details of my background check,"Recently signed an offer for new position and am nervous about some discrepancies with my resume and the background check (through ProForma). 

* My current position (been here for about 3 years) is ""Technology Analyst"", but I put ""Software Engineer"" on my resume since that gets more responses and more accurately reflects my day-to-day (primarily backend development).
* 3 years ago, I worked as an intern for 6 weeks since I found a better paying job (my current role), but I put 3 months on my resume since I thought it would look weird that I only interned for 2 months.
* 3 years ago, I had another internship with a startup and left after 3 weeks (put two months on the resume) since they refused to pay me. I was never paid nor given any employee accounts/ids, so I won't show up in any of their systems as previously employed there.
* For all of my work references, I put the number of the HR departments rather than people I knew. I also haven't even called the numbers to check if they were right.
* I did my freshman year of college at a different university than the one I graduated from. To save space on my resume, I put that I went to my alma mater for 4 years. On the background check, I included both colleges.

73,Hired to be junior software developer - expected to now be company jack of all trades,"At the beginning of Q4 2020 - I quit my job in hospitality sales/customer service to enroll in a coding school/bootcamp. I saw this as an investment, and a career choice that would provide me with ample job opportunities, and personal, professional, and income growth. 

Beginning of Q2 2021 - I land a job as a junior software developer with a SaaS company in the hospitality and travel space. It seems like a great landing spot to start my new career in technology, and I'm hopeful that I will be a great asset to the team, while also having an opportunity to learn a ton from the senior developer I will be working with, and also begin building a strong resume, and larger skill set to eventually grow my career as well as my earning potential. (32 years old - looking to buy a home, start a family - yes income is of high importance at this stage in life)

I am immediately given assignments to write API integration code in PHP (I studied Javascript at coding bootcamp, so took a bit of time to get accustomed to PHP), and eventually given a hard deadline to write a certain number of integrations by a certain date, or lose my job. This was a stressful time, and the senior developer was largely unavailable, or fairly nonresponive at times when I needed help (which was quite a bit, this being my first job as a developer). I barely met the deadline (with some help from folks on CodeMentor, paid out my own pocket). 

As a result of not exceeding expectations on this, as well as some pressing needs in other areas of the business, I am moved off the tech team for a couple of months to assist in our client onboarding process. This has mostly consisted of juggling various manual tasks in different software programs we use that have been thrown my way. Have not been writing any code during this time. 

Am I doing the right thing by being a ""team player"" in this situation and taking on these other tasks - or should I be looking for a different opportunity where I am put in a situation to build up my dev skills more intently, and possibly be in a position to receive more direct mentorship/interaction with a Senior developer?",cscareerquestions,1637183238

A few months ago I started a new job, and everything about it has been fine. Not perfect, but fine. I’ve been content and the pay has been pretty good. My only riff has been I don’t want to relocate. So far we’ve been working remote and the relocation has been pushed back a few months for COVID. However as relocation time draws near, I’m less enthusiastic about relocating for the position.

Is it worth just relocating and continuing my position or should I take the time to apply to other positions now before I have to relocate. How would that look on me as a job seeker? If I do decide to apply, should I remove the job from my resume or could I use it to get myself into a better position with the experience that I have so far? For the most part I’ve only been doing Automation Test QA and I’ve wanted to delve into development but I won’t be able to until the project I’m on is complete.

For reference I do not have any ties to the company right now, there hasn’t been any company matches on the 401k yet and I’ve been only given a relocation bonus but I don’t mind giving that up if it means staying where I currently am.

Sure, it’s not pretty, but it works and does the job. When I said I need more time to make it “pretty” he just smiled and handed it over to another developer.

You might think my boss is an ass, but he’s a great guy and I love working with him. How can I make him understand that I am not just sitting in the office all day fooling around?

86,How much communication is required as a programmer?,"I have been working toward becoming a developer for a few months now due to feeling burnt out in my current career (insurance claims). I have since realized one of the biggest problems I have with my current career is the amount of communication required. Constant phone calls, emails, texts, meetings. Requests for information that has already been provided (sometimes multiple times) that they didn't listen to the first or second time. Requests for updates when I've made it clear if I have not made contact, there is no update. No one listens, causing me to repeat myself. There is almost no uninterrupted time when I can just get my work done. I consider myself a good communicator, but I am more introverted so the quantity is a problem.

I really want to avoid an ""out of the frying pan, into the fire"" situation. How much of the above reflects your experiences in programming/on developer teams?

I would really look forward to a job where there are a few specific people I need to communicate with and who actually retain what I tell them.",cscareerquestions,1637179501
87,Feeling like I'm stuck in CI/CD pipeline hell sometimes -- is this just normal dev or is my company doing something wrong?,"I'm currently waiting for my pipeline to run so I can submit a merge request, usually takes about 10-12 minutes to find out if you passed or not for this particular project.

This is one of 10 components I need to merge into for this current project. Every component must pass build/test of course, as well as a Sonar scan, a security scan, a linter stage, and then actually upload the releases or pre-release versions so they can be deployed. 

This thing I've been working on was done over a month ago. One developer wanted a pretty minor change but due to all of these interdependencies, it took a long time for me to implement it all the way down the line. It is a matter getting project1 working locally and THEN passing the pipeline, so project2 can consume project1, so then project2 has to be working locally then passing the pipeline so it can pass it along down the line, and so on.

The actual ""meat"" of what I am working on is so minor, but all of these pipelines and scans makes it difficult to actually get my changes out. If someone wanted something as simple as adding a single field (10 seconds of development work), but that logic is added at the root of the project (our core library for example), it would probably take at least a day to get that to a state where it could be deployed.

It is just so frustrating to develop like this. You lose your train of thought so easily. I try to optimize my local environment as much as possible but it isn't always possible to not rely on pipelines and some of these projects being available in the cloud as opposed to referencing them locally.

91,Should I continue down this SE career path?,"Hello All, could really use some guidance for my situation.

So I currently working as a Senior SE at an agency for about a year. The agency has a contract with a customer where I'm basically just maintenance support for their systems. The job pays well, but I'm just the guy that relays information to other teams. I would not really classify myself as a software engineer, I would like to be a developer. 

I graduated from college in 2017. I have very little work experience as a developer. I was not very engaged in school and learned just enough to graduate. My first job out of school was a development role but it was entirely PL/SQL, low paying and had very little room for growth. 

Since my current job requires very little of me, I try to use that free time to teach myself new skills and expand my knowledge. I have been struggling over the years to teach myself anything. Java is my main language but I wouldn't consider myself to be good at it. Whenever I try to practice or learn, nothing clicks. I sit there for hours trying to understand and it feels hopeless. I've been trying to teach myself Spring over the years so I can create something and motivate myself to continue but it seems useless.

Despite my shortcomings in learning, I do believe I have good work ethic. The customer I am currently assigned to is essentially looking to hire me from the contracting agency I work for. Managers/Team Leads have been inviting me to calls and giving me pointers on my resume so I can easily bypass the first stages (HR) of the interview process. They've told me that no real interviews will be conducted and the job is basically mine if my name appears on their list. 

I like how much I'm being paid. Sometimes I do like having free time during work hours, but I feel like I'm kinda wasting my time here. I don't feel like I have what it takes to become a developer and I feel like if I continue down this path, I will hit a point where nobody will hire me because I don't have enough knowledge in a particular category. What should I do here?

94,Amateur wants to go pro...,"I've flirted with coding on and off for years. I learned some BASIC in highschool 20 years ago. I did a single semester of CS in uni as an elective where we learned some C++. I've been modding bethesda games for fun for a few years now, picking up bits of their in-house 'papyrus' language as I go. I once made an interface and search engine for a databse in microsoft access at a job that had nothing to do with programming (where I ripped off other bits of code that I googled and copy pasted and changed slightly till it worked). Nothing fancy, but the things I want to make eventually work the way I want them to. Basically, for years now, if I wanted to do something that involved programming I learned as little as possible to get the thing I wanted to work, and never really invested much or any time into formally learning things or doing courses.

Two nights ago I decided to try codeacademy out of boredom and worked through their free C++ lessons over the last two evenings. I liked being able to work at my own pace and I burned through the lessons relatively quickly. If I remember by C++ college course from years ago, we didn't get to vectors and arrays until like week four and there was a lot of boredom waiting for the slow kids once I'd already done the exercize for the day. With codeacademy I was able to finish one exercize and move on to the next as fast as I wanted. So I signed up for the pro version and they gave me more projects and quizzes to work on (turns out the paid content is a little more extensive than the free stuff).

One thing jumped out at me, the ""Fizz Buzz"" problem. Their intro paragraph said that is was (or maybe still is) a common interview question to test creative problem solving skills to filter 99% of prospective coders at the entry level. Is that true? Because I solved that problem first try with no help and it worked. (well not quite first try, I had my nested IF statements backwards, but I figured that out first time I ran it) Is this really a thing that people have trouble with? Is this really the kind of question that comes up in interviews for entry level programmers?

Basically, I'm 35, I have no credentials at all, and I have no time or money for a full CS degree, but I think I enjoy this kind of work and I might be good at it. Is a bootcamp the right thing for me? Should I just keep working through stuff on codeacademy? I'm probably going to finish the rest of the intro C++ exercises tonight or tomorrow, but where do I go from there?

I'm probably going to stick with C++ for now, because It's what I'm most used to, but I'm not ruling out learning other languages.",cscareerquestions,1637176346

\- Codebase is primarily in C (some projects use C++ too)... but most roles use low-level languages like C

\- There's more projects and teams (only 1 team in Austin)

&amp;#x200B;

Austin:

\- Small Office with fewer amenities

\- Fewer Employees (30 employees); \~5 interns

\- Austin is a tech hub (not an HFT hub)

\- Slightly hotter weather in summer (rest of year weather trumps Chicago)

\- Will use C++/Python and some Machine Learning as well

\- Start-up like feel since the Austin Team is expected to grow very quickly over next few years so it'll be like watching a small start-up grow in front of your eyes

\- EEveryone is super close to each other.. they went Go-Kart racing last week and even watched Eternals together this week); they seem very close

\- I've spoken to 2 employees at Austin and they seemed super nice as well (one of my interviewers who I really liked also was in Austin)

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be really appreciated. For me, weather and office perks don't mean much because I know I'll be desensitized to them in a bit. What matters more for me is the Team and Future Job Prospects. I feel like Austin's team is really nice and that I'd get along with them easily (although I've never talked to anyone at Chicago so Idk if they're also similar). Also, the skills of C/C++ and ML sound like good skills to have in the future versus C-programming in Chicago. But a lot of people I spoke to said Chicago would be better because that's where all the top HFT firms are. And tbh working with C at the lower level sounds kind of fun (I'm not super into ML stuff).",cscareerquestions,1637173396
5,Starting OMSCS as a career changer. What else should I be doing to get a internship other than LC?,"I’m a Biology grad from a top 50 school with CS coursework that is equivalent to a minor.

I enrolled in OMSCS to fill in my CS gaps as well as use it as a springboard to get a job (I live in the Bay Area). 

Other than Leetcode and working on side projects, is there anything else I can be doing to increase my chances of getting an internship/job? 

I'm not super familiar with getting referrals or reaching out to recruiters but is that something that is mandatory for me to land a position? Should I be contributing to open-source, going to meet-ups, or maybe hackathons?

I really hate the way the material is being presented. Each course lasts approximately 10 weeks.

This makes it incredibly hard for me to retain information. Unfortunately brick and mortar schools are too expensive for me/too far. 

I also don’t have much interest in SWE positions. I’m much more interested in business ops, supply chain and PM within a tech company.

We saw housing prices go up as much as 40% in some areas in town over the last 12 months, which has caused a similar increase in rent(I rent and my most recent lease went up 25%). If my current company(local internship) comes in with a lowball offer when I graduate, is current housing costs viable leverage?

Extra info ahead of time.
This company doesn't allow fully remote. 
Adjacent cities and being slightly outside the city has seen similar housing increases so moving farther away from inner city doesn't really help.

31,Advice on landing cs job while I’m uni/college,"
TDLR: Trying to get junior software job but feel the barriers to entry (long requirements lists) are so high and I have no contact currently to get me around it.

I’m a second year cs major. I live out of home and my fast food job is shit since I have to work at awful hours. I’ve been programming since I was about 11, and I’ve almost held a perfect grade at university for all my courses thus far. I don’t receive financial support from parents or government, and believe me, I’ve tried.

I’ve made a plan to teach myself the curriculum for backend development set out in roadmap.sh which I plan to finish within 6 months. I’ve got access to LinkedIn learning courses for free, and I’ve aligned relevant courses to get me up to speed with these skills.

I’ve also worked as a junior software engineer before for 8 months, but I resigned as it wasn’t a great fit for me when I was just starting uni. For reference, I had connections to the boss there. I got exposure to the cloud, databases, lots of programming in varieties of languages.
(C#, JS, SQL, Python, etc etc)

Besides this, I’ve had exposure to lots of different things as I’ve programmed since I was young, and I feel that objectively I’m decent at picking up new things easily. A project of mine at the moment is to create a web scraper to put my shifts in google calendar using azure functions, nodejs, azure logic apps, etc. I’m just learning this as I go and I usually just learn what all the cloud services can do in an overview and go from there.

Right now I don’t really feel like I’m making progress towards landing a junior software role. I could reevaluate my goals and work backwards and do the things like network l with people, build projects, so up my GitHub, etc, but I’m a bit desperate. Every job search I seem to be doing are junior roles requiring years of experience, and the only roles which don’t have these long lists are internships. Who the hell is going to do a three-year internship to meet these ridiculous goals?

Somewhat long winded but has anyone felt they’ve been in a similar position, and how did you get out of it and land a role?

I have experience full 2 years before that and I worked as a student in software development jobs while I was studying for my master's. I do not apply for senior positions, only junior or mid-level, I know that I am not ready with my current skills.

So, the general structure of interviews, as everyone knows:

If I am not already rejected; HR talk -no problem, casual talk

A casual technical talk with some leads - no problem, casual talk, even crack some jokes

Usually a task implementation - most of the time no problem

My problem - technical interview in-depth with engineers

So, I can not point the problem at this step. I study for my task implementation, so I am ready for questions about the task or some other related topics. Of course, I can not answer all the questions, when I can not answer it I just say my ideas based on my current knowledge or straight up say I do not know.

I realized that, when I am talking, sometimes I am not so sure of myself. When I make a guess, I say ""I think"", ""It can be"", "" I am not sure, but"", and so on. Should I be always sure of myself in technical interviews? Or am I supposed to give the correct answer to all the questions? If I do not know the answer, should I just shut up? English is not my native language, can it be a problem, maybe I can not express myself in some technical details? Should I be always serious and technical?

I can not deny the fact that I need some studying, but I do not think that's not the whole picture. Maybe everyone is a CS genius, I do not know. I would really appreciate some general directions towards this.

44,Choosing between internship offers,"Hi there! 

I am very fortunate to have gotten two great SWE internship offers this summer, but I’m having a tough time making a decision and would love to hear any insights from the members of this community!

One of these offers is Amazon which is a great company to have on a resume. I’ve heard working at Amazon can get you an interview at most places for future jobs. It’s also a larger tech company and I’ve only had experience working for smaller ones. The downsides here are that I’ll be put on a random team and I’ve heard negative things about the working culture there.

The other offer is MongoDB. MongoDB seems to have a great work culture and the people I’ve talked to have all been awesome. I also get to pick the team that I work on. The internship seems really well structured as well. My main concern here is that Amazon is more well known and might open more doors for the future, especially considering I don’t go to a well known school.

Personally, I would lean towards MongoDB for a full-time role between the two, but if my goal is to learn a lot and get a good experience this summer and then apply for other competitive companies in SF/NYC/SEA again next year for a new grad role, which company should I go with? Does Amazon look much better on a resume than MongoDB, and does that outweigh the positives that I get from an internship with MongoDB?

So guys, I've been working as a software engineer for about  5 years and I have such a ""weird"" daily schedule for my point of view (maybe it's not weird, maybe it's common, but I believe it's weird)

when I have something to do I break it into small tasks daily.. I have a deadline and I try as much as I can to deliver everything I have to do, but often I take long breaks after finishing some of those small tasks and rest for the rest of the day.

For example, I have to complete some sort of new feature, so I break it into small tasks, and when I complete one of those small tasks instead of proceeding with the other ones somehow I assume I finished it and then I rest.. I watch youtube, I take a nap, I go to tiktok, whatever.. I do any other thing but the following small tasks.

At the end of the day I basically code for about 3 to 4 hours and the other following moments I do basically nothing or I go to meetings.

I'm being really honest.. sometimes when I try to continue I cannot focus.. I get sleepy or I cannot concentrate for any other reasons.

50,Leaving FT role for a W2 contract to hire,"I am a software developer in a FT role with a 160k base. I also have an RSU package and yearly 15% bonus potential. With that said RSU are down 20% from when I started. I'm burned out with this company as it's very fast paced with unrealistic expectations.

I have an offer on the table for a W2 contract to hire at $110 per hour and FT conversion at $175k. 

Ultimately the W2 contract will net me an extra $4k+ per month until conversion at which point I'll have a $15k yearly raise over my previous employer.

My skill set is in high demand so I'm not too worried about the risk of not converting or ending up unemployed.

51,Can someone help me pick the right specs for an upgrade?,"I've worked with a crappy laptop before finally landing a gig as a software engineer. While my work laptop is great, my personal laptop is the still the same ol' crappy laptop, so I've been saving up money over the past few months to invest in a new one that'll be future proof and last me at least 5 years without any hiccups, and that's when the new Macbook Pros caught my eye.

I've done some research and what specs would work best for developers, but, at the end of the day, I find that these review videos/articles don't really represent the real world very well. I mean, there's only so much synthetic benchmarks or one-off tests can tell, which is why I've decided to come here for help, as it seems like there are plenty of experienced individuals here to give me some wise advice.

Here are the specs I chose with my reasoning :

* 16"" Screen : More screen real estate === more room to see more code

* 32-Core GPU: Might be overkill for a developer, but I enjoyed working with 3D software and designing back when I had access to my university lab computers, and I would love to be able to do that again as a hobby

* 32GB RAM : My friend told me that I should go for at least 32GB if I'm planning on continuing full-stack development, along with tools such as Docker, as I could run out of RAM really fast. I'm considering 64GB just to fully future-proof this thing, but would be that overkill?

* 512GB Storage : Honestly, I would go even less if they had the option, as I prefer to store everything in an external SSD anyways.

I don't know if the logic behind my choices were good enough for me to truly future proof this laptop, but I'd want to go for the cheapest, yet most future proof option, and this is what I was able to come up with. Of course, I'm willing to shell out more cash if I have to. It may be a lot of money, but it isn't too bad an investment if I'm planning on using the device 7 days a week for at least 5 years. At least, that's how I look at it.

I'd love to hear your criticism(s) on my reasoning behind my choices and whether or not I should go for weaker/more powerful options. And, of course, thank you in advance!",cscareerquestions,1637156503

So I'm 23, about to finish my 11th and final semester in college. CS major. I switched majors a few times so I actually had to pack this semester with some really hard classes that nobody takes simultaneously. It's made me very miserable and I'm not even able to take in everything in my classes, just rushing to get HWs done. 

Every 10 days after being really productive, I'll break down and not leave my room for 3-4 days doing absolutely nothing but watch Youtube. Then I have to catch up coursework for a week and then I break down again. And now it looks like I might fail a couple of classes unless a lot of things change.

I've only been sent a couple coding online assessments in my many, many, job applications. And I've failed all the tests when I've took them with no prep. But get this, out of no where last week a recruiter for a company emails me, on an application I long gave up on. We schedule a time to talk, she seems very interested in me, we even discuss salary and such. Tells me she'll send me a coding assessment (on coderpad) and if I pass, I'll do 3 back to back live coding stuff with SWEs at the company.

Unfortunately, I am at very very low motivation right now and I have absolutely no time to prep for the online assessment. This honestly seems very rare opportunity since this is the first time, I've actively been recruited and the salary and the company is great. I haven't spoken to anyone in real life about this so I'm just putting this out here I guess. I'd appreciate any advice or any kind of response. Thanks.",cscareerquestions,1637139491

I do frontend and am currently taking care(due to having made them) of the reusable components (datepickers, autocomplete, combobox, multiselects, popups etc.) as well as developing most of the main website itself. The reason why I am doing these is because according to my manager, I am very technically skilled. I am also very stringent on the graphics(I want the UI to look great). I have also led/am the main contributor in 3 projects so far in front end. 

I only have 2 and a half years of work experience(but have had projects with ReactJS in college and made a website/deployed on to GCP for my uncle) and am paid a total comp of 118k. The company is located in the Bay Area and is evaluated at 300+ million. 

I have been doing a great job and contributing a lot, but the work has been staggering/unbearable for me lately. Since we have an India team, I was getting messages from 5-7 different people on slack when I wake up in the morning and during the day I have more people asking me for help. This is because I am doing the main website which everyone interacts with. And during the day, I will have more people asking for help. I have 36 tickets assigned to me last sprint(serious) which I reassign to others since its too much. I am being pressured to do overtime due to issues being high priority.

But my title and salary doesn't match what I am doing. Other frontend developers at the same level and pay at my company don't need to help so many others. I was fine with what I doing before I got moved to developing the main website. I like front end but I don't want to lead projects anymore or do the main website anymore if I am being paid the same.

I complained about my salary, and have been told that currently is not the time for raises and that I will likely get a title promotion next year. But even if I get a promotion, the salary just doesn't fit with other Bay Area salaries. If you get 7-8 unfamiliar people messaging you daily and sometimes blaming you/asking for instant additions or fixes/ etc.. The pressure is too much. And honestly, I am fine with it if I get paid good for it/quite down for a 996 schedule if the salary matches the overtime. I have coded 20 hours no sleep etc. Every developer who joined with me(total of 10 people) have left and have urged me to leave. I feel drained.

I've joined a new job as PO since last week, for a really promising product.

Here is the thing though, there is a gigantic understanding gap between the business and software team.

Although there is no documentation to help my onboarding, I have already a pretty good idea of what is going wrong.

The backend dev / app is extremely mature, although there is technical debt because the dev was pushed a lot by commercial pressure.

The frontend is the issue: it started out because the software team had no staffing to fill the job. So one good willing enthousiast filled the gap but he is NOT a software engineer or part of the digital team.

It is supposed to be a mobile app but it's just an improvised angular webapp (no ionic) without unclear requirements. It is not production ready and should not be sold as such, but it has been sold already. I haven't seen the codebase but I can tell it's not done by a professional software developer, and I can tell it was done without any roadmap in mind.

They're thinking it's a good start and can be improved upon, but I think it's due for a rewrite with proper specifications and technology.

The thing is: noone from the business (including my manager) seems to realize the wall they're heading towards. Only the backend dev gets it I think, I still need to confirm my feeling with him.

How do I procede to tell the business to stop doing shit around like excited children (they're right though on one thing: the product IS promising) - 

My advice would be hire a real mobile app/ react native but it's gonna hurt feelings and I'm the new guy ?

I've rarely seen such a gap of maturity between the engineers and the business, usually when clueless stakeholders have too much powers, they also have terrible developers. Here there are great software engineers but incapable of educating their colleagues from business.

92,Recruiter from top company reached out - advice?," A recruiter reached out regarding an SDE II position at a company starting with ""A"". I'm at $85K TC (Ohio) and the position averages about $230K TC (Seattle, Washington). I've been working at my current job for 3 and a half years as a defense contractor with a clearance. I kind of hate to give that up to go private sector, but I think the pay is too much to pass up. What are your thoughts on giving up a clearance to go from government work to private sector in a situation like this? I am not actively looking for a job and my pension vests in 1.5 years, but I was already considering moving and I'd love to have FAANG on my resume.

I'm basically coasting through my job right now. I put in a ton of work in college to get a 4.0 in bs-cs and then found a cushy job where I sit back and work once in a while. It's made me soft and it's kind of boring, but I've gotten to actually take time to enjoy life because of it. My small team of 4 is awesome to work with and my boss is exceptional - basically lets me get away with anything as he knows I have some sense to manage myself and produce results. Am I making a mistake to go for this? I've heard they make you work extra hours frequently but I don't know if that's mostly just a myth. I'm not afraid to work harder, but I fear that joining something like private sector, after government work, will be a shock to the system.

The recruiter says he feels pretty confident about my chances, and from a resume and experience perspective, I can see why he does. But from a coding interview perspective? I don't have any idea what I'm doing as my current job was handed to me on a silver platter by my professors. I will have a week or 2 to prepare before taking the assessment, but I'm not sure that's enough to prepare myself for this from scratch - I'm a good programmer, but my DS&amp;E is very rusty. I'm nervous that I'm going to mess this up from lack of practice - is this a really rare offer for my situation, or do I have little to worry about and there are many others like it for people with my experience? I can't even fathom that high of an income.

I've only gone to a lesser known college due to proximity to my parents at the time, so I'm kind of surprised that FAANG is reaching out. Will my college of choice affect my chances, or is experience really all that matters at this point?

I'm having trouble making a decision as to whether I should even be looking into this, as I really like where I'm at and have a clearance that can take a year or more to get. I need some context as to whether this is a rare opportunity or if I could have this opportunity without a recruiter reaching out. Any advice regarding studying for the assessment would be greatly appreciated as well - so far, I think I'll go with a little Cracking the Coding Interview, a few easy-medium LeetCode, youtube videos on DS&amp;A, and a read-through of the Leadership Principles.",cscareerquestions,1637127913

I thought I was moving from a place where the engineering discipline was okay (small team of 8, very nice workflows and automation that we worked hard to setup and get right) to a place where I would be really able to learn best practices from hundreds of engineers. It didn't turn out that way. My new organization, at least with the product I am working on, is very disorganized. The stuff that makes it passed PR is unbelievable sometimes. I would complain about having no tests running in the CI process or as PR checks, but the truth is there are very few tests and low coverage. In fact, the developers don't seem to know anything about it and don't run the tests we have, so things break and nobody notices. It's the wild west, and I've already made a bunch of changes that provide some guard rails in terms of both processes and tooling, but we have folks on the team that are clearly pretty happy doing whatever they feel like and the level of investment in being much better (which we could easily be with buy-in) isn't there.

I'm making about $60K above my previous base salary, and now I have a yearly bonus which is cool I guess, but if I would have known that this is how it is, I would have stayed at my last job longer until I found something where I could really stretch my skills. So far, I can tell that this is going to be constantly cleaning up after developers who aren't constrained in making bad decisions by good processes and automation. 

I take my growth as an engineer very seriously. I am looking forward to thinking what this sub has to say about taking less money or forgoing opportunities where the advancement in terms of skill is unlikely to be strong.",cscareerquestions,1637125579
99,New company forcing to join in less than a month,"Hi guys, my friend is in a complicated position and would really use some help from your collective wisdom. 

He recently interviewed in a new company, and although hasn't formally received the offer letter, has been through salary negotiations and background checks. Today he got a call from the hr of the new company (which is quite reputable) telling him that he has to join in less than a month and he **has** to accept the offer **by today** or he won't receive the formal offer letter. Now, although the new company is providing a higher pay package, it seems like they are twisting his arm and are playing strongman tactics. What should he do in this position? His present company has a notice period of 30-60 days, so it's impossible for him to follow their instructions and join within a month.

Thanks a lot in advance!",cscareerquestions,1637124160

2,Is this amount of what can only be described as corporate worship normal?,"Been in a new position for about a month now, and there is an uncomfortable amount of 'corporate worship' going on - I'm talking training videos which talk about the company values, history, people, and products, onboarding items which require us to understand these things, quizzes to test how well we align with those values, and so on.

Is this normal? Am I taking crazy pills? Am I the only one who hasn't been brainwashed? Does everyone quietly think this is all ridiculous but no one talks about it?

This is a bit of a rant post, since realistically none of the above affects my day to day work.

4,Deciding between a Qualcomm SWE or Capital One PDP role as a new grad," I am a senior who will be graduating college next year and I am trying to decide between a software engineering role at Qualcomm and an associate product manager role at Capital One's Product Development Program. For the Qualcomm role, I will be working with the modem software team to apply machine learning algorithms to optimize modem processes. I do not know what team I will be joining at Capital One since it is a rotational program. My long term goals are to pursue my own start-up, join a startup in a high impact role that involves both engineering or product, or become a technical product manager at FAANG or similar tech companies.  


Pros and cons of each:  


QUALCOMM  


Pros  
1. More exciting work. My potential manager said that the team is working with cutting edge machine learning technology, patented work, etc. Plus, I feel like ML and AI are hot topics right now in the tech startup ecosystem, so having some ML background may be beneficial if I want to join some startup working in that domain. I will definitely grow as an engineer in this role.  


2. Excellent compensation package at 100k base, 25k sign-on, 10k relocation, 13k/yr RSUs, 10k retention bonus. Not as impressive compared to FAANG salaries but it will still feel weird turning down this money.  


Cons  
1. If I start off as an engineer, it may be difficult for me to transfer to product management. I asked my manager how difficult it would be for me to try out PM at Qualcomm and he said it would be like applying to an entirely separate organization since his team is an engineering focused-team. I will definitely grow a lot as an engineer, but if I want to develop those leadership and collaboration skills for me to be an effective startup leader, I may not find that at Qualcomm.  


2. Progression. Looking at my colleagues' profiles, it seems like most of them have master's and PhD degrees in ML, EE, CS, etc. I definitely know I won't be doing a PhD, and I am still contemplating on whether I should do a master's in engineering. Based on my performance in school, I know I won't be a hotshot engineer, which is why I have started looking into product management and am considering an MBA in the future. I think a mix of engineering and business background will propel me further in my career than if I just stayed a pure engineer. So I am concerned I won't be promoted as quickly as my colleagues given this.    


3. Distance. My family lives on the east coast and this position is in San Diego. I asked my manager if it would be possible to work remotely for 2-3 weeks for several (4-5) times a year (i.e. during Christmas, Mother's/Father's Days, birthdays, etc.) but it doesn't sound like he wants this to happen too often. He did say he would be flexible on this during holiday seasons and summer, but that's it. I won't have as much of a problem with distance if the job is really worth it (eng/PM job at FAANG or a high growth pre-IPO startup), but I don't think Qualcomm is worth the distance.  


CAPITAL ONE  
Pros  
1. Flexibility. Since it is a rotational program, if I find that I don't like product management as much as I had thought, I can apply to join their technology development program (TDP) for my second rotation.  


2. Location. I am considering their offices in McLean, VA or Wilmington, DE, which will make visiting home less of a hassle.  


Cons  
1. I am concerned their product program may not have as much of a technical focus since on LinkedIn I see a bunch of business and psychology majors in the program. I don't want to lose my technical edge or become rusty in my technical skills when it comes time for me to apply for FAANG or tech startup jobs in the future. However, they do send out a form for new hires to indicate if they want a more customer-facing or a more technical role, which is a relief.  


2. I am not as enthusiastic about the pay (87k base/9k sign-on/1.5k relo at Wilmington and 96k base/same sign-on and relo at McLean. No RSUs.) as I am about Qualcomm's pay. But honestly, I think the difference would be marginal, as plane tickets would be expensive coming from San Diego to the east coast, and San Diego has a high cost of living.  


Given my career goals and what I believe each position has to offer, I would love to hear people's thoughts on this.",cscareerquestions,1637122918

I’m going to graduate this spring with a bachelors in cs and a minor in applied math. I’ve been reading about how people lined up jobs 3-6 months before graduating and I’m wondering how they did it? If you have had this experience comment the steps you took.

Do I look for posted jobs that are actively hiring now and apply? I find it odd that companies would be willing to wait 3-6 months until I could start. 

My advisor has been very unhelpful in this and has mostly dodged the question. They have told me to apply for as many jobs as I can when I graduate. Although, to avoid moving back in with my parents it would be best to have a job lined up.

7,"Coworker is a nice guy, but more of a Junior developer than my manager realizes. How do I approach and bring this up?","I'm transitioning into a Lead/Senior dev role for my team, which means additional responsibilities; one of which being delegating tasks out to my co-developers, and managing things from a technical standpoint - But no people management. I have no reports or anything.

One thing I'm concerned about is **raising my voice about coworkers who aren't... as good as my manager thinks they are** (not because my manager is wrong, but because they don't have insight)

---

Foremost, we have no ""junior devs"" on the team. There are devs whom have greatly improved the last few months. I love it. Makes it easier for me to trust them and delegate more to them, since I have to start off-loading my work since I can't do it all.

**But I'm getting stressed** from, Bob, whom is a good guy. But to put it bluntly, **is more junior that we expected**. Bob actually interviewed for the ""senior"" role - but after the interview we agreed:

&gt; ""he isn't quite there yet, but we have high hopes for him to grow into that""

Unfortunately, the more I work with Bob, the more I fear that Bob is actually pretty Junior.


# At first I thought I was being to harsh of a critic...

So I gave Bob a project to himself. I had an initiative to solve [x] problem given to me from my manager. I knew what needed to be delivered: fixing [a], implementing [b], and [c]. And was told

&gt; its up to you on how to delegate, between you, Bob, Dick, Jane, Sally, Phil...

So I decided to lay out the requirements, explain to Bob, and give him the keys. 

*I didn't wanna do it myself. I wanted Bob to do it without my help, because I feared I was previously holding him back by not letting him fly on his own.*

***Both me and my manager seemed on the same page that there was no reason why Bob couldn't do it.***

---

**Unfortunately, this led to Bob getting stuck and coming to me.** 

I did not mind! Its okay to get stuck. But what disappointed me was how Bob mentioned:

&gt; yeah I'm not sure about [a]. Its not working and I don't have experience with [a] so I'm not sure what to do.

I'm not an expert in [a] either. Thats the point. figure it out. 

... after a little bit I realized that idk if Bob had the skillset to do the above. By 'skillset' i don't mean 'knowing about [a]' I mean the skillset of ""learning and figuring out something hard by yourself via reading/documentation/exploring/trial-error/etc""

**So eventually, I took half a day and did [a]... then handed Bob the keys to do [b] while I did [c]** 

Objectively, I don't think Bob could have done it, now looking back. At this point I start to get more involved in doing work alongside Bob - *at the end of the day, I need to deliver this to my manager*

**Bob is slower on [b] than I would have expected and its kinda messy and ehhhhh stressing me out...**

[b] wasn't that hard to be honest. I did [c] which was the harder part in a few hours. But Bob took a couple days. And I got stressed because I had less and less confidence in Bills solution to [b]. But he already spent 2 days on it. I can't scrap it all and do it myself... well... I could... but thats being a shitty coworker.

I **have** had to 'secretly redo' some of Bob's work. Refactor it at a later time to clean it up, and so on. Largely do to the above. its okay. and our review process allows it to be upped in quality at the time of PR. But, it sometimes leads to other problems, due to poor implementations - that I had to account for myself later. I think: ""its good for now, just approve it""

**When I have to step in, I do it because necessary but feel guilty in how that comes off**

# In addition, I see other areas where Bob is very junior-like

- When it comes to bugs, some fixes were fixes that were ""idk why it works, but this other way works now"" which resulted in causing future problems.... 
- Less input than hoped for when discussing things as a group
- Less than ideal ability to find out whats wrong rather than ask for help
- Limited ability in exploring new things outside their toolbelt (adding unit tests, etc)


---

I'm now stuck between how to go about this...

**Bob is really a Junior, so in my mind, he needs to be used more as a Junior...** Meaning, bug/simple feature work goes their way. Bigger stuff he's not ready for.


**Problem is that my manager doesn't really know (i dont think)...** and the plan was for Bob to grow to take on more. 

So idk how to approach. is this something I bring up to my manager? I feel like I need to, but don't know how without sounding like:

&gt; yeah this bob guy aint that great

- If I keep going as is, I will sabotage myself in delivery time of things. When I give someone a task, I need to trust that they can do it. I can't continue to ""fill in"" whenever they get stuck over and over.
- If I treat Bob as a junior, I kind of ignore my manager's initial ideas and sabotage Bob.",cscareerquestions,1637122205

9,Leetcode/Hackerrank 1 year roadmap,"Hi, long time lurker here. As the title has said I want to know if any of you have any specific roadmaps to follow to ace these coding interviews for FAANG. A little bit of background story, I am currently studying computer science in the second year of a four year course. I have just failed and been rejected by a lot of companies for internship. I aced my coursework for algorithms and generally am doing well for school and even personal projects. But I am having issues with just solving these problems in the time constraint that was set. For example a company I was interviewing with gave 60 minutes to solve 4 questions, 3 was medium and 1 was hard. I managed to only do 1 and a half. Now I do not want to be depressed about what is done and gone, but definitely I want to be more prepared for next year.

13,Can I succeed in computer science?,"Background: I'm in my first semester of university, and I am hoping to major in computer science. I had very little programming knowledge prior to this semester.

I am currently taking an intro programming course in python at my university, and I have been struggling a bit if I am being honest.

I understand all of the topics. For loops, while loops, lists, dictionaries, etc. The concept of each of these topics is not so much an issue for me. The main problem is the assignments. 

I was able to finish the first assignment with relative ease and did OK on it. The second one however was worse. I was unable to finish, but I did whatever I could and managed to scrape a B-. We are currently on the third assignment with just under a week left, and I have completed about half of it. However, we are supposed to write a function which I feel is quite complicated. It is really scaring me, as I am afraid that I may not be able to fully complete this last assignment either. I plan to get help in the coming days, but I am still worried.

I really love computer science. I find it extremely fascinating, and I really don't know what else I would want to do. I'm far more into it than just for the money, trust me. I love the idea of being able to create programs to perform tasks, to make apps, etc. I just find it all so fascinating, and I really want to get to the point where I can built these things myself.

I plan to do my best until the end of the semester, hopefully get a decent grade, and then practice every day until next September (which is when I will be able to take my next CS courses). 

I guess what I am trying to get at is, am I cut out for computer science? Seeing some of my classmates whiz through assignments has kind of bogged me down. I know they likely have years of prior experience, but it still makes me feel bad about myself and my abilities.",cscareerquestions,1637117624

I am switching careers from a sale career mid level to programming. I am going to go to online school to get my first degree. I have two different options for completion and I want to know if the high ranking public school is worth the price? 

&amp;#x200B;

The first option is as I said a highly ranked public school. I would be going online so I don't believe that I am eligible for the internship opportunities and even if I was I live in a completely different state. This option would be roughly $12,000 more than option number two.

The second option is an online school. It's not a degree mill, they have a brick and mortar, but it's nothing to write home about. It is a okay school, instate so pretty affordable, and ultimately $12,000 cheaper for the degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that schools with phenomenal reputations values lie in the relationships built and the internship opportunities.

26,5 years in and I feel like I chose the wrong profession,"When I got my first WebDev job I was ecstatic. I had finally made it as an engineer in Silicon Valley and I was hungry to learn anything and everything. What I lacked in formal CS knowledge and schooling, I made up for in enthusiasm. Nearly 4 years on the job, I moved up ranks through the Junior frontend engineer leveling system at my company and got great performance reviews from my manager and generally good feedback from all others. 

Long story short, I began to burn out slowly and ignored it. I was part of a team that didn't seem as interested in front end as I was and they deferred difficult tasks and business logic over to me. At first I took it as a sign of respect and trust but now I see that they were really just taking advantage of me. At the three year mark at the company, my long term gf (and soon to be fiance) left me. It was the straw that broke the camel's back; it broke me. My work ethic tanked and as soon as it did, new (offshore) engineering management who I did not have as strong of a relationship with turned on me over the course of 2 quarters. Feeling like a shell of myself and completely defeated, I quit. 

Today is the second anniversary of that day. It took me about 18 months to even have interest in interviewing again and today I've done about 50 different interview processes. They begin well, and being very comfortable with React.js programming, I usually ace the technical screens and move along to the onsite. Several 4-5 hour virtual onsites later and I'm still here at square one. Nothing seems to matter before the onsite, and one tepid conversation or missed question within that onsite leads to a rejection. There is never feedback and each time the boulder rolls back down the mountain and you're forced to start from the bottom with less fervor, enthusiasm, and confidence. 

At the very least I learn something new each time to improve on. Usually system design, navigating cultural questions, or leetcode trickery. But each company is different and in each case, my skills are found wanting. On one hand it feels ridiculous because I KNOW I'm good enough to make an impact but enthusiasm and past achievements aren't enough to sway the swollen ego of an interviewer. The worst part is that startups and small companies seem to have more difficult and opinionated processes than big companies. I have made it to the final onsite with several big companies while simultaneously failing screens with 15 man startups. I have done countless hours of take home projects sometimes to be rejected immediately after. While generally longer and more drawn out, bigger companies seem to be easier interviews...

Tonight I received a rejection after a 5 hour virtual onsite with DoorDash last week where I gave my all. Most of the conversations went well, but I have the nagging feeling like I will always be lacking something. I will never ace the interview, some answers will always be wrong no matter how I prepare. To pour salt into the wound, the old colleagues that I outperformed (in compensation, contributions, and engineering level) went on to get hired by companies like Intuit and Google. I have onsites coming up with Coinbase and Google (somehow Google let me bypass their tech screen but there is no way I will pass based on past performances).

I have a degree in Electrical Engineering but took some software-related courses and all my internships are in software engineering.

1. Complete a cool side project

2. Improve my resume/LinkedIn

3. Create a portfolio website 

4. Leetcode/ maybe read crack the coding interview

5. Start applying (and maybe network with people on LinkedIn)

I've recently been thinking about going back to school and pursuing a degree in Computer Science but I'm not sure if that's really what I'm after. I love working with computers and find different programming languages very interesting to learn and use. I currently have a degree in Architecture but I'm thinking of switching fields and going something more along the programming route (although this is very broad and I'm not really sure what exactly I would like to do). 

Bottom line is, my local community college offers a wide range language certificates. For example, they have C++ Language proficiency certificate, JAVA, LINUX, UNIX. and a lot more. They also have Computer science degree paths too, and as my community college is one of the biggest in IL, they have an extensive amount of paths I could take. 

But I essentially want to know if it's worth it to just go for these certificates and if that alone would be enough to get my foot in the door for a job. I'm of the mentality that you NEED a degree to really make it in an industry but I have no experience whatsoever in this sector so any help at all would be great. Would going for a computer science degree make more sense or no? I'm sorry if this is really broad and vague so feel free to ask any questions if it'll help clear anything up.

One of the positions I'm interviewing for is a renewals manager for a software startup that just got a 3rd or 4th round of funding.  This position would basically be the first of its kind in which I would be in charge of the renewals process.  So building out a strategy/process for renewals going forward and then being the sole person dealing with renewals (at least the foreseeable future). 

The pay is still good, albeit it's less OTE than what a typical mid-market or enterprise sales rep would get (very little bonus but solid salary) but I'm genuinely fine with that.  This role appeals to me because it seems much less stressful and I don't want to carry a bag anymore.

Just recently however I found out somewhere along the line I seem to have been moved up to Engineer II. This is great to hear from a progress viewpoint, however, I was never told and as such not given a change in compensation.

My question is: is this normal? Is it standard practice to just not receive any pay bump within a year even if you move up progression levels? I'm curious as this is my first position in this industry and don't want to come across as greedy, but these roles have different responsibilities and expectations and if the pay is the same between these two roles, I would technically need to wait to become a ""Senior Engineer I"" as that is the next step in my company's progression.

63,Issues with Hackerrank,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this or not, if it is not, please redirect me to a better place to ask. But since it involves online assessments for a software job, I believe it still adheres to rule 1.

I had an online assessment at some company that involved essentially a rewording of this problem [https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/) and using 2d arraylist data structure instead of arrays.

I was able to ""solve the question"", but I had issues when I came across one part of the instructions that said  ""If no location is possible, return a list with an empty location, not just an empty list"" I have no idea what this means. How can a location be empty? It is not an object that I can just create a default value or null value. The location is just a pair of two integers. And since points can be negative also, I can not just use (-1, -1) as a default ""non empty location"". I don't think using null is a solution either, so I was completely lost on what exactly they wanted from me. 

I just want to learn how to avoid this type of situation in the future because I have had similar issues with vague working on Hackerrank a few years ago. I was able to take my exact code from Hackerrank and convert it from arraylist to list and run it in Leetcode and it ran faster than 99% of submissions and with less space than 50% of submissions, so I know my code works and is fairly efficient, but I ended up failing half of the test cases on Hackerrank. If companies are going to keep sending me Hackerrank assessments in the future, I want to make sure I can avoid falling into the same pitfalls and actually use this opportunity to learn.",cscareerquestions,1637101184

69,"Told I was going to get an offer, and then was ghosted","I interviewed with a company a month ago and actually did really well on all of the interviews and technical interviews, which is strange because usually I royally fuck up the whiteboard coding questions. The job looked very promising with at least a 50% raise in base salary.

I did the final round of interviews on a Friday and got told Monday evening by the recruiter/HR person I had been talking to that they’d be offering me the position and would get in touch with me the next day. I was ecstatic and couldn’t focus much on my work the next day, refreshing my email every 15 minutes. The email never came.

The next day I send a follow up email and get a response saying that they apologize for the late response as they were traveling and delayed and didn’t get back until late the evening before. She also apologized and said the position I interviewed for was filled the day prior but she was contacting another hiring manager to confirm I would be a good fit on their team instead and she’d have more information for me tomorrow.

Well, that’s incredibly frustrating that I’d been told they’d offer me a position for a team and then straight up fill it in one day before they’d even talk to me, but I told her that was understandable as mix ups happen and that I was happy that they were looking for other spots in the company as they clearly wanted me. I figured a mix up in HR wasn’t indicative of the engineering culture there, as the engineers I interviewed with were very pleasant.

The next day comes and no email. I email her again on Friday asking if there was an update. She said there wasn’t yet, but there would be next week. I waited until Wednesday of that week too email for an update and then the Monday following that and I did not hear back once at all.

This entire experience has just soured me on this role, it seemed like an incredible opportunity for me and it seems I’ve been ghosted.

To twist the knife even further, I got a notification from LinkedIn the other day about a similar position from the same company in the same place that had just been opened. I’m strongly tempted to share the link of that job posting and ask if that was the position she was talking to the hiring manager about.
If you were told no by the other hiring managers, I perfectly understand but please fucking tell me. Don’t get my hopes up and then never respond. I can somewhat understand not responding to every single application, but if you get to the interview stage for the love of all that’s holy, just fucking send a rejection, *especially* if you tell me you’re going to send over an offer and then don’t.

I was hired to be project support ie. documentation, invoicing, spreadsheets, reconciliations, supporting project managers etc. Generally supporting the team in the background, without having to lead/coordinate/make decisions.

I recently got a new manager, and I'm not sure if maybe my title was confused somewhere in the transition but he keeps referring to me as a Project Coordinator and is wanting me to do Project Management training, and is kind of moving me into a role where I take the lead and am coordinating and scheduling things, making decisions and driving a project forward.

I'm not interested in that role. I have spent my whole career seeking a job where I can support in the background like I was. I've been in an administrative role in some capacity for 10 years. I've gone through a few different industries and roles in my 20s trying to figure out what's best for me, and have finally been happy with this role for the past almost 2 years. I'm not interested in climbing the corporate ladder, nor being a decision maker. It makes me extremely anxious having to do those sorts of things. Case and point, I don't even like planning events in my personal life! I also have my first baby on the way, and my dream is actually to be a stay at home mom, but we can't afford that so will eventually ask to go part time at least. My main goal in life has always been a family, and a job that I don't hate that provides enough for a family in addition to my husbands income. Call me old fashioned. 

My role thus far has been moreso, I am instructed/asked to do things, and I do them, and am valued for my work. As opposed to me deciding tasks and things for others.  

My question is, how do I relay this to him? I know its always included in job descriptions that ""duties may change as required"" but is there a point in your adult life when you can say no I don't really want to do that? If this was part of the role initially, I would not have applied.

72,Should I ignore new recruiter and try to work with previous one from same company?,"For context, I interviewed at a company in February, passed the phone screen, and got rejected in the onsite with mixed results. 

From my understanding, from what I've seen online, people who make it to the onsite can usually interview again in the future, skip the phone loop and go to some onsite. This is what I wanted, and intended on doing. 

A recruiter from the company reached out and I had a phone conversation. They mentioned that they didn't see my onsite in their system, and asked that I do another phone screen before proceeding (although they did see the phonescreen, said it looked good, but because it was &gt; 6 months I had to do it again). 

I'm thinking of contacting the old recruiter, mentioning I'm interested in retrying an onsite and want to try to skip the phoner and set an interview for some time in the future. At least then I might get more info in context if I still can't skip the phone screen for whatever reason (they know I attended an onsite). 

Does this sound like a good plan?

So has your company started firing people for not being vaccinated? I don't know what happens at Oracle after 12/8. I do  not know if they are going to start firing people. A bunch of people are throwing fits on teamblind about not submitting anything and rebelling, bleh. A few people fight like kids back and forth on slack (I am not touching that. you gotta be crazy to argue in a slack channel with 15,000 people in it). 

When I read a news article about the Vaccine mandates its pretty soft. Companies don't have to fire people right away. They can decide what to do. That is actually fairly smart. You don't want to wreck a business line ,but I would not want to return to the office unless we are near 100% vaccinated and the only ones who are not are people who legitimate can NOT take the vaccine.

77,Has anyone transitioned from being a dev to being an instructor / teacher / trainer?,"x-posted from /r/cscareerquestionsEU   

There was a job posting that caught my eye and it was for an instructor at a coding bootcamp, which I found somewhat interesting

I know these positions are likely to be less well paid than full on dev roles but I was curious to see what the job was like and how the market for these positions is in general (i.e how easy is it to transition into doing this)

78,How much will it screw up my career to job hop for a second time,"I’ve got a weird situation. 

I graduated in December 2020 from a rural college in a town with no tech sphere. I took the first offer I got, which was with GM. They baited and switched me into data entry with effectively no hope of becoming a real software dev, so I bounced quick. I plan to not even include this job on my resume. 

I then started a job as a software developer for a pretty low salary ($54k, Charlotte NC) to GTFO of GM. I’ve been here 6 months now. This company only works in contracts and outsourcing; we have no product of our own. They promised me I’d learn so much here, but they have me on only one project that takes like 10 minutes of work a day, and I’ve written only like 4 SQL queries in my entire time here. Manager won’t give me any more responsibilities and I’m only learning what I teach myself with all my downtime. My manager is not a pleasant person and the workplace is a bit racist. High turnover after one year. 

I’m getting attention from recruiters on LinkedIn for positions that pay 60% more at minimum. Would it destroy my career to bounce a second time, particularly if I leave GM off the resume? I will explain why I’m leaving by saying something diplomatic like “I have a continuous desire to learn.”",cscareerquestions,1637096842
79,Job not matching description: what to do?," Throwaway account here.

Hey all, I'm a new [M.Sc](https://m.sc/).  graduate who had previous experience in Software Engineering / ML  through internships and a good track record of accademic pubblications  (Machine Learning). I'm based in Southern Europe.

After  receiving some offers, some of which were in academia and other in the  industry, I decided to join a company that makes financial software  tools with banks as the main customers. The company has about 500 people  in technical staff and is part of a larger group counting 10k  employees. The wage is quite good.

I started two days ago and I realize they blatantly lied during the interview process because:

\-  I asked how many direct managers I would have and was told 1, I  confirmed to them that I don't like having more than one manager because  more often than not there is drama. On my first day at work I find out I  have 2 managers.

\- I was told I  wouldn't need to travel. Now, I found out I'm the only member of my  whole project that is based in my city. The rest of the team is based in  a city 200 miles from here so I'm spending my day in teams calls. I  feel like they should have at least warned me of this. Moreover, they  haven't formally requested it yet, but they've already casually asked me  if I'd like to pop my head in the other city.

\-  I was told the job split would be 80% backend engineering and 20% data  engineering/pipelines. I also checked in with them to confirm they had  no short staffing issues. First day on the job and I get told by my boss  that due to short staffing I'll actually need to do more like 60%  backend and 40% frontend.

I couldn't care less for frontend as I want to work in a data-centric field.

What should I do? Confront them? Leave just because they lied? Put up with it and see where it goes?

I  feel like, If I had had this information before starting, I would have  picked another offer, but now I turned those offers down.",cscareerquestions,1637096559

I was extremely proud and satisfied and expected to learn a lot. Each intern got their own mentor, and we were told we would be doing technologies like Angular and Node js. I thought, ""Okay, this is an ideal opportunity to learn something new."" But the last month of my life turned into a nightmare. I do absolutely everything myself, and the mentor just reviews what I did. We have no education or lectures on what we do. I go to college at the same time, and it’s impossible to keep track of both things. The internship takes me at least 8 hours a day. The mentor often responds slowly, and sometimes doesn’t even know how to solve a problem I’ve encountered. He also looks at every little thing and expects me to know everything perfectly, even though I started learning such complex technologies a month ago.

I ran out of ways to avoid answering, so eventually I said my range was $150k-160k. After all the interviews were done, they came back with an offer for $155k. 

Yes, this is higher than what the description said. And it was exactly in the middle of what I asked for. But I am a bad haggler, and there's a part of me that says if I throw out a number, and the other party accepts without negotiating, then I sold myself short.

I'm based in Canada with 1 YOE in full stack development and currently working.

I've been a frontend developer for the past 4 years or so, and have developed applications in php, vanilla js, angular and react, and well, being upfront: I think I am **bored** of frontend development.  


I currently work in an amazing company, the pay is good (but somewhat lower than the average), but I don't have the thrill to do the work anymore, every sprint is just fixing things and working on the design systems, and while I have no problems at all, and can deliver ~~dubious~~ quality code every sprint, I don't feel motivated at all to stay in this field. Though I know that it must be like that in every other area of software engineering.  


So I was doing a casual article reading and got interested in webgl and computer graphics, though I am not sure I should invest my time learning it (I followed some examples and it was quite complex to me), as I don't know if it will be a profitable career in the future (but it seems like so, with all this change towards digital worlds and all \[~~meta~~\]).

After that problem I reached out to my boss to tell him that I wasn't comfortable with the latests events and he was very supportive.

11,Unethical job search as a new grad,"Using my throwaway for obvious reasons. I’m gonna be a new grad soon with a very low gpa and no relevant internships. I wanted to outline my experience job searching and receiving an offer. Now before I do this I want to make it clear that I know I’m a piece of shit for doing this and I don’t recommend anyone do this because the stress and anxiety of it all is not worth it, regardless of if it works or not. I am mostly doing this to clear my conscious tbh. 

Like I said I will be a new grad soon, this spring. It has taken me 5.5 years to receive my bachelors. I have a 2.3 GPA currently with a non-CS STEM degree (Physics) and CS minor. I originally did not take college seriously which affected my ability to get internships. I understood that without internships I would basically be screwed when trying to find a job and became extremely depressed and anxious about my future, which also affected my schooling. I have failed a handful of classes, one class took me 5 times to pass. And before anyone says I’m privileged I live with a single parents with 3 other siblings, I receive no help and currently have 70k in student loan debt. 

Now to the job search. Like I said I knew I would be fucked. When I first started searching I took the advice of this sub. Left my gpa off my resume, did personal projects and tried to focus on those in interviews. Notice how I said interviews, I indeed get a handful. However with my debt I really wanted a job lined up for when I graduated so I wanted more chances. This is where the unethical stuff comes in aka lying. During one summer I worked for my ex’s fathers company, very small and nothing to do with CS. I knew the only way background checks would be able to verify this is by calling them directly. So I put the company on my resume and labeled that I did SWE work as an intern. Doing this with no other changes got me significantly more interviews. I even got to the final round in a few. However in these interviews it was always brought up that my gpa was not on my resume, and I was asked what it was. In the moment I would lie. I knew eventually they might find out but I wanted the interview experience. 

After these experiences I took an even greater risk. On my resume I put that my gpa was over 3.0. Once again this resulted in even more interview hits. It got to the point where I was having 3-5 interviews/phone screens every single week and it was honestly overwhelming. I had interviewed so much at this point that I was able to talk convincingly about my fake internship and the work that I did there. My gpa also was never brought up in interviews again. I would specifically apply to jobs that made no mention of gpa requirements in the hopes that I would not have to submit my transcripts. 

Like mentioned before I eventually did end up receiving an offer for a position. This was contingent on a background check. I reached out to my ex and told her that when they call to give the title and dates that were on my resume. They called, she verified everything, and the background check cleared. There has been no mention of submitting my transcripts and I am all set to start in early June. Overall I applied to approximately 200 jobs over two months. I only did 3 leetcode easies, 1 medium, and 1 hard. I did not have to do any assessments for this position. All bullshitting. Like I said I know I will receive heat for this but I wanted to give my perspective since I recently saw a post asking what happens to people who bullshit through college. I regret not applying myself earlier and doing better. I will most likely delete this post later but will try to reply to any questions",cscareerquestions,1637086672

I hate my college career path and I need to get out before the end of this year with my notice in by end of this month due to **$$$$** involved in the contract.

I have always liked tech so I looked into coding and turns out I love it so now I've been learning coding through TOP &amp; FCC over the last 3 weeks and have learned a lot (almost done with foundations track).

**My question is:** 

What are the lowest barriers to entry **coding** or tech jobs that I could apply to?

Now the contract is ending, I want to become a permanent employee at company ""B"" for which they are offering me a role of Associate software developer. 

So essentially I have 2 years experience working in this company but only as a contractor and now I will become a permanent employee.

What are the salaries on similar role and 2 years of experience.

Also if I get offered some salary should I try to negotiate to get a higher salary becuase of experience in the same company.

28,"Help me decide between offers, I have one day left","I am a junior in college and I currently have 3 tech consulting internship offers I am deciding between for this next summer (I have 1 day left to decide so any advice is appreciated).  


1. **PwC - Cloud and Digital Technology,** specifically the Salesforce team in their New York office
2. **EY - Cybersecurity** Tech Consulting - Atlanta office
3. **Deloitte - Risk and Financial Advisory** \- Technology - Atlanta office

**Pay differences (hourly):** EY is highest, then PwC paying $2 less, and last is Deloitte paying $3 less than PwC. I am not too worried about pay since it is just an internship but I believe these would reflect their full time offers so I am also trying to keep that in mind. 

For context, I have no experience in consulting, and I haven't taken any cyber or cloud classes yet so I am not 100% sure on what each one does. I have been leaning more towards cloud since it seems like a broader and less technical field. I am a Management Information Systems student, so my technical skills are pretty lacking lol. Another reason why I liked PwC is that I would be in the NY office which sounds pretty fun since I've lived in Atlanta my whole life, although I have a feeling I could ask EY to switch my location to NY as well so I am not too worried about that. However, I know cybersecurity has a huge demand right now, and there are a lot of great career paths there as well.

So a bit of back ground I got a BA in Anthropology and a BS in GIS I’m currently working for a city that offers tuition reimbursement. I work pas a geospatial programmer/analyst/admin

I landed this job by learning a bit of Python, familiarizing my self with automating workflows, and automating my old jobs work flow. So now that I am in a better financial position and have a job that is offering me tuition reimbursement I’d like to go back to school (I actually wanted to go back for a while now even before this job) however I am not sure how to approach this. So I really like CS and what all it does, I can learn stuff on my own specially with this job but I genuinely like school and would like to go for a masters. I just don’t know how to approach this. I have looked into Masters programs but they require a bunch of courses that I didn’t take since I wasn’t a CS major. Which I don’t mind taking them since I’ll learn a lot along the way(but like one that’s annoying is the Math not bc I don’t like it but bc the pre req is calculus but the pre req to that is pre calc and the pre req to that is like trig lol like it’s gonna take along to just meet the pre req) . So should I get a masters ? Should I just got for an associates? A third bachelors? A certificate? I guess the question is what is my end goal right? Well I don’t want to do this for the money but I do like that software developers get paid very well. (Right? Lol) so I started as an anthropology major focusing on archaeology and still love the field but they don’t get paid well and you really don’t get to lead excavations or research until the masters level, so I fell into GIS bc it incorporates into Archaeology very well but also the plan was that I could land a great job that paid well which would help me fund my masters education in anthropology but also I really enjoyed GIS. So right now I could do that but I still want to also peruse a higher education in the tech sector which my interest in it initially grew through GIS. 
Again I really like CS and so it feels like the same thing as before where I want to peruse an education in CS which can fund more education in anthropology later plus I can be learning something that I seem to enjoy. As far as what my end goal I would like for CS would be to have a full stack and be able to land an even better job later.

38,It's now viable (even profitable) for companies to let employees/candidates spend some time working for a good cause. Why do they refuse to?,"Conventional wisdom would say letting employees work for charities and good causes is a massive resource drain, but that has been dramatically changed by remote work. It's now viable to fit blocks of 'micro-volunteering' into normal day-to-day schedules without leaving your desk.

More importantly, there there are increasingly common business activities that:

* A: Can be replaced with impact alternatives with relative ease
* B: Where the impactful alternative would actually provide superior value

For business activities that meet the above criteria, there isn't even a time-cost to volunteering, because it's time that would have been spent on the activity anyway! The two most obvious examples are:

1. Replace the **fictional** case studies and tests in the hiring process with real-world (remote) equivalents that allow candidates to solve real problems for non-profits.
2. Replace traditional L&amp;D activities (i.e. useless seminars/workshops) with real-world (remote) training where employees solve real problems for real non-profits.

I have been speaking to different management teams and it seems that, even if they agree with the viability, they don't have any desire to change. I started a [company](https://www.impactdistributed.com/) to try kick-start this change by doing all the implementation/coordination for companies, but the resistance has been the same.

I know it is too much to hope for altruism from companies, but why resist if you genuinely believe it can drive profit and competitive advantage (e.g. attracting better employees, increasing engagement and tenure)? 

Does anyone have any insight on the matter?

I feel like I am interviewing well but then getting to the end of the interview process and being told 'we are going to pass on you'. I ask for feedback but no company responds.

The primary concern is that these companies are seeing what I'm asking for and at the end of the process and saying 'nah, he's not worth that'. I'd generally qualify that I am not blowing any minds with my answers for coding challenges or system design problems, but I am solving them correctly and quickly.

All my opportunities thus far have been through external recruiters putting my name in for these companies, so presumably that number has been relayed to them.

Is it possible I am asking for too much TC and that companies don't try to negotiate a candidate down, even if they like them? Cause I'll take that feedback right now.

45,I gave up on programming... and it feels good.,"**TL;DR: Make your experience coding, and do not feel like a failure if you do not go ""all in"".**

Hi everyone, 

as this community has helped me throughout my journey, I wanted to give back, by telling my story. Hopefully it sparks some ideas, inspiration, direction or at least some good time wasted :)

Beginning of the year, I quit my job (at a FAANG company) to pursue a boot camp. Why? Because I was always interested in coding and solving problems. In former jobs, I used to consult (hence a lot of Excel/Spreadsheet work) and work very closely with Product Managers and Developers. 

The bootcamp went well, and at the end of it I understood a very basic OOP language with added JS, SQL and HTML/CSS - hence all the basics to be a web developer. I generally started the bootcamp with a huge interest in product management but with this bubble I was immersed into, I was more and more dragged into the idea of becoming a backend developer. My main goal was always to have a remote job and to work location independent - not particularly being a freelancer or being self-employed, I enjoy/don't mind working for a company.

After teaching and job hunting for some months, I landed a job as a junior back dev. I was happy. When I finally started my new job, it hit me like a truck. My brain does not think like a dev. Due to my previous positions, I developed a very strong customer experience/satisfaction view on things, always questioning what the benefit of features are - ""Why is this needed? How does the customer engage with it?"". In my personal experience (I know some of you might see that different, but circumstances showed it to me this way) I saw, that developers rather think about the ""how to solve a problem"", and less about the ""why"". 

I simply did not feel as good coding full-time as I thought it would feel back when I finished my bootcamp. I took my time, to think about my decisions and - here comes one of the hardest things in life - be honest to yourself. I was romanticizing this job because of (1) potential high income and (2) remote job possibilities. I simply was blinded by it. I decided to leave my dev job.

Now I am starting a Strategy and Project job in a tech company and work closely with developers and product managers. I understood that Google AppsScript and doing some Spreadsheet magic is enough ""coding"" for me to be satisfied. I see that I flourish more in this role and hence have a higher chance of getting what I want and being okay with it. If I enjoy doing something, then (1) I have a higher chance of being good at it than other and ultimately getting appreciated and paid more - and additionally I believe that if we do something we love we can resist a higher level of stress for it. 

Regarding my main objective of working remote (personal opinion - feedback welcome): Corona has proven that - at least for tech companies - remote work is possible. There are many more jobs that can be done remotely than just coding - e.g. Product Management, Project Management, Account Management, etc. I hope that at least Corona proofed this to a lot of companies.

Concluding: I think coding is still a beautiful job, and I love doing it by myself. I enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when solving something. I just see that in this whole construct of developing an app/website my part might not be the one of a dev, but I might excel rather in strategy/project management. Giving up on coding does not feel like a failure, but more like a confirmation that it should be a small part of my professional life, and I am thankful for the skills I learned and experience I made.",cscareerquestions,1637072844
46,Aren't big tech companies supposed to value strong fundamentals and problem solving skills over 'knowledge'?,"For context, I'm a freshman at some university in the EU and I applied for multiple internships at big tech companies.

To my surprise, a recruiter contacted me via email very shortly after applying (less than a week) for a front-end internship at one of these companies and we scheduled a phone 'conversation' in which they asked me some technical questions.

First off, I wasn't expecting a technical interview with a recruiter, so I mostly prepared by answering questions such as 'why do you want to work at our company?'. 

Secondly, the questions were not the type of questions that I expected from a technical interview at such a big company. The recruiter asked me about some JS methods that I had never used in my personal projects and weren't actually that common (from what I read online). I didn't want to google the questions during the interview as that might have backfired, but after it was over, I could find the answers to most of them in less than 10 seconds. I was expecting some leetcode-type questions, or at least something that didn't involve memorizing the JS documentation page.

Lastly, one question that was really weird to me was ''What is the behavior of the 'this' keyword?''. I obviously asked for some clarifications but the recruiter didn't seem to know what they were asking me and just repeated the question. I politely said I didn't know the answer and we moved on, but that was definitely the biggest red flag for me.

My question is, has this happened to any of you before and is it normal at big tech companies to be asked this kind of technical questions by recruiters that don't even understand what they are saying, or was I just unlucky?",cscareerquestions,1637072551

Any advice would be appreciated.","I have only 2 years of experience as a SWE and I only had one job that I am currently working at. I feel like it's time to change because of the lack of novelties and challenges. 

I had interview at the company that outsources developers, the company itself is great but I did not like the interview with the client. They seemed nice, but basically the project scope is that I should work on an app that was written in [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) 10-15 years ago and transition it into .NET core. 

The team is being recruited now so they have not started working on it yet. First they will need to establish some standards for rewriting the code and gradually developers will start working on it. 

From your perspective, how beneficial it will be for my knowledge and programming skills to work on such project? Of course salary is important to me, but as I am at an early stage of career, I need a proper guidance more. Due to lack of this, I still feel like a novice after 2 years of working and I don't want to keep working in an environment that does not contribute to my professional development.

Another thing is that I could only answer about half the questions on a technical interview, so I am not sure if they are going to hire me anyway or not. But still, what are your thoughts and experiences about such projects?",cscareerquestions,1637068112

We have some of the biggest players in our field as our clients and there have been rumors that some of these said companies are even interested in acquiring us.

I am paid a decent wage for my country and have a standard options plan, but over the past few months the salary for engineers such as my self has greatly increased and I have had recruiters reach out to me with very competitive salaries. I have been recognized as an outstanding developer and own many key components, but I have only received a single low raise since I have started. I like my coworkers but the work has gotten a bit monotonous and I have been thinking about whether it is worth looking into other companies that might pay higher but are already established (FANG etc.) or startups that have meaningful work but might not be game changers.

I like the idea of this, especially as getting experience seems like the best idea right now but I’m not sure if I should be spending an extra year of university doing a placement like that or whether I should just get a masters degree instead.

1. Funding: $12.5 million (Series A happened this year). Series B round expected in next 3 months. It merged with another Bangalore-based startup with funding $0.69 million funding.  
2. Product: They have finance payables and receivables software for mid-sized companies, having integrations with Tally, SAP, Zoho, Oracle, MSFT Dynamics, etc.  
3. Clients: 500+ including OLX, Meesho, Urban Company, Amway, Quikr, Khatabook, Forbes Marshall, ShareChat, Swiggy, Metropolitan Stock Exchange, Postcard, etc.  
4. Stack: Ruby on Rails, React, etc.  
5. Role: Senior Product Engineer. My work will be to do code review on juniors, design a lot of scalable systems with the team, and get them approved by the architects. The company will groom me to become a Tech Lead.  


Offer [\#2](https://www.teamblind.com/tag/2): E-commerce B2C pre-IPO company, Myntra (acquired by Flipkart which will do the IPO)  
1. Funding: $399.8 million (parent company Flipkart has funding of $12.6 billion)  
2. Product: The team that I've got is the Planning &amp; Buying team in Supply Chain Management (Inbound) team.  
3. Clients: If you're in India, you're probably a client.  
4. Stack: Java, Spring Boot, Airbus (wrapper on Kafka)  
5. Role: SDE-1 M1. My work will be to ramp up on the Java tech, contribute 40% to tech challenges and 60% to business features.  


Both are paying similar TC, more or less. And they are ready to beat one another.  
I am confused because:  
1. The fintech startup is saying that the SaaS industry will grow like crazy and I can ride the wave to riches. I will become a senior engineer and architect sooner. E-commerce time was 12 years ago. And they are aiming to become a Unicorn startup and my ESOPs will make me Richie rich someday. They also said that the pre-IPO company, Myntra/Flipkart stocks won't increase as much now as it has already matured. We can't even count on it being x2 times, in fact, many companies' valuation decreases post IPO (I don't think that will happen to Flipkart!).  
2. The E-commerce startup is saying that they are a part of a huge company that is eyeing a bumper IPO soon. I will be given the freedom to take up the kind of work I want to grow in my career. As it's a well-established company at this point, I will have the security and enjoy the office perks &amp; benefits.

Why wasn't this part of the interview process? I can't give my boss from my last job - that specifically ended _because_ his issues with addiction were invading the workplace.

6,"Transitioning Army Officer seeking to live in San Diego, what would be the best way to accomplish my goals?","Hey all, I'm an Army officer about a year and a half from being able to leave the military. I have a wife and a child on the way; we've decided together that we can't continue with the Army and want to settle down in San Diego to be near her family.

Goals (in order of priority):

* Be a present father and husband

* Live and work in San Diego

* Maximize income


Education/Test Scores/Certifications

* BS in Electrical Engineering (4.0 GPA) from West Point.

* GRE: 170Q/165V/5W

* FAA Commercial Pilot (Airplanes and Helicopters)


Experience:
6 years as an Army Aviation Officer flying AH-64D Apache helicopters. Multiple operations management and project management-equivalent positions. Combat experience.

I'm thinking the best route to accomplish my goals right now would be to apply for an M7 MBA program and then attempt to return to San Diego either as a management consultant (BCG, Deloitte, PwC, Accenture), as a product manager for tech/biotech (Qualcomm, Viasat, Intuit), or as a program manager for a large defense contractor (General Atomics, Lockheed, Northrop).

For my family situation, I'm aiming for at least $130k TC.

What would be the best way to accomplish this?",cscareerquestions,1637036546
7,Consulting VS Software Engineer position,"So basically I landed entry positions at a Big4 firm as a tech consultant and a big bank as a software engineer. The big4 pays a little bit less but you get a lot of exposure to the business side of things and it is a little less coding oriented. The bank pays a little more but you work a desk job that is a fully technical software engineer position. While I enjoy the exposure to people I get in Big4, I also think it is very competitive and political, while the bank is more work life balance and could get me a consulting job later if I like but I don’t like coding that much honestly.

My undergrad was a top 10 CS program, but I was a pretty middling student there. I did not enjoy my job, quit, and went to grad school in a humanities field. I hope to graduate with my PhD in that non-CS-related field in 2-3 years. Would a 7-8 year 'gap' in my resume (not actually a gap, just time spent doing something not-CS related) be too much to overcome in finding a job? I would plan to re-learn a lot of the CS I've forgotten over the next several years, but given that the next several years will largely be consumed with writing my dissertation, it isn't like I will have time to develop a lot of serious or impressive projects.

16,CS vs Data Science Major,"Hello. I am currently debating on whether I should do a CS or data science major. Right now, I am taking an intro CS and intro DS course at the same time. I’m currently on track for the DS major, but I’m not sure if I should commit. I don’t exactly know what I want to do in the future other than something in the CS/DS field. 

I’m struggling in my DS class compared to my peers due to most of them already having a lot of knowledge of python. I’m set to continue the class sequence for the rest of the year, but I’m not sure if I can handle it. I find the topics interesting but the programming difficult. The things that lean me toward this major are the fact that I tried really hard to get into the DS classes in the first place and the rewarding nature of DS jobs. But I also heard that job searching with data science is more difficult because you have to compete with masters/PhD students for most job listings. DS jobs  also seem to be hard because they’re more math heavy, which isn’t something I’m too interested in. 

On the flip side, I am doing well in my CS class because I am actually learning the fundamentals of programming, albeit in DrRacket, which is considered “useless.” Because of this, I find myself actually struggling less in this class than DS despite the fact that it’s expected to be harder because I actually have to problem solve. I also find it a little fun. However, future CS classes might be harder compared to future DS classes. I heard that it’s easier to get a job in CS compared to DS because it’s more generalized, although I’m not exactly sure what I want to be yet since I’m still fairly new to programming. I also heard that your GPA doesn’t matter as much and it’s more based on your personal projects. 

So it mostly boils down to how easy it is to get a job and which major’s GPA matters less during job search. I would appreciate feedback on whether some of the things I said are wrong and would be willing to clarify anything if needed. Thanks for the help",cscareerquestions,1637031179

19,"If you are a socially anxious person, what could your boss say or do to work with you on your career goals and challenges?","I vouched for a person on another team, so they're coming to mine. I will be realistic - they can't speak up for themselves, don't complain when warranted, don't try to actively move menial tasks to automation or a team that can help with automation. I feel like I'm the only one trying.

I know that there is some social anxiety, and a solid level of discomfort talking to clients and presumably others in authority. I at least emphasize, but this is stifling their career growth, at this company or elsewhere. With the projects they were stuck with for the past year or so, the only reason I assume they hadn't quit is fear of interviews.

I want to approach this topic, and I'm not sure what to say without coming off as an asshole, but at the same time I don't want to downplay it. The lack of assertiveness is what explicitly stifled even just financial growth, I was told in no uncertain terms.

If you have dealt with this as a manager or as an employee, what helps frame this sort of conversation? That ultimately, I need them to at least aggressively outline their existing duties that are candidates for automation, and channel it through me. To speak up when there are obvious areas of improvement or excellent suggestions, which I know they have if I pull teeth. Can I recommend a mentor? A course?

Current situation: 37 y/o working in healthcare, make about 100k a year. Stable job, salary unlikely to increase (not more than 130k by the time I retire in 30 years). However, I couldn’t care less about the job that I’m doing. Have a masters degree, like logic puzzles, did coding 20 years ago back in high school (C, c++) but I remember none of it. Truth be told, I’m just burnt out and figure if I’m going to do a job, might as well pick one that makes a decent amount of money. 

Questions:
1.) am I too old to be jumping into this field? I was planning on doing a bootcamp (codesmith, etc). I’d hate to put in that effort and then find out that no one in their right mind would hire someone that’s 37-38 that’s a complete newbie with no portfolio

2.) what’s the job security like? Realistically, in my current role, I can find a job in most big cities for roughly the same amount of pay and you generally don’t get fired unless you’re incompetent. Will they fire me 5 years in because they can get someone younger for cheaper?

So I been at this job for about \~2 months, and initially I was told it would be at the office but as soon as I got here, they had re-imposed working from home. Initially it was somewhat difficult to really understand what I was doing as I felt a bit isolated, although I did try to talk to my team through our group chat/ calls.

 I felt a bit down as it took me a few weeks to complete a ticket, since I kept reviewing it with my team mate, which they always seemed to want improvements. I do not mind but I guess I feel a bit slow compared to the others. I am currently doing another ticket, and most of my tasks have been just front end work, and I honestly don't really understand most of the other aspects of the project the team is working on. 

I also have an issue with working from home, as sometimes I just feel really unmotivated to begin working. Along with this issue, I feel a bit slow working and sometimes feel anxious in stand ups as I don't really have much progress done sometimes.

I started learning python via Udemy, made a decent amount of simple projects and tried implementing them at work. I just started learning javascript and am working on a personal website to showcase.



My question is if I have a chance to land a programming related job? If I do will it be entry level? Will I have to restart at a lower salary? My current compensation is not amazing it's $85k with bonus. I recently brushed up my resume and tailored it to a programming related one. Should I start applying? Anything I might need to add or work on? Resume is in the link below, any advice helps!

56,Do all jobs highly focus on accomplishing goals?,"Personally me, ive never been one for sharing goals. My current graduate job feels more about making goals, sharing them with manager and then its a lot of hammering regarding this. I feel like its more focused on this rather than doing projects

Even got accused of faking a goal for the sake of it, which I wasnt. It was genuine one but I can't really think of any other than getting experience.

Was just wondering if all jobs were like this? Not sure if its just my people manager. Even thinking of only staying one year at my job and finding something else",cscareerquestions,1637016076

I'm concerned that telling recruiters about my issue could make things difficult. I'd be low balled in salary, not hired or not interviewed.

Video conferencing subtitles do not work well for technical interviews. Particularly when you're screensharing.

65,"Unable to find work, how can I stand out more?","So I feel like I'm in an unfortunate spot. I have around 10 months of experience working as a developer (3 month contract, and a 7 month job I recently was laid off from). I have been applying to jobs like crazy, but I've only received 2 preliminary interviews, both of which I haven't heard back (and probably won't). 

I feel like most people are looking for either fresh graduates, or people with 2 years of experience. But I'm stuck in the middle. Another part of my brain also tells me though that it shouldn't be that relevant and I should be hearing back more, so I must be doing something wrong. 

What can I do to stand out more? I have a personal website (my fullname on my country's TLD) that I include in my cover letters or when ever they ask for examples of my work. 

For further context I've positioned myself primarily as a full stack developer working with PHP. So TL;DR:

1. How do you stand out to employers more? (In general)
2. Should I learn any other technologies?
3. Should I be writing a cover letter for every job?
4. I've been applying through Indeed. Should I check out other sites? (I'm in Canada)

Any advice would be appreciated. My last employer sort of fucked me over by laying me off with no notice right after I moved.",cscareerquestions,1637013261

Front end dev, 1 YOE

BOTH companies are offering me ~85-90k, HOWEVER.

Small local company is fully in office, with a potential chance once I move to be completely remote. Position is for front end development. 

Accenture is fully remote, and I would be getting a clearance and be a fullstack engineer. 

Now, for myself, I was really wanting to move to DFW, TX or the greater Atlanta, GA area. While I am okay where I am now, I do not want to stay there much longer. I want a place I truly enjoy, and where I have friends with similar interests and events to attend. Being remote lets me do that, as I'm not tied down to a specific area.

As for why I'm not just applying to companies in those places: 
Trust me, I am. I am either getting rejection emails or hearing nothing back. It's a little disheartening, but I can probably attribute it to lack of experience (many of them wanting at least 2-3 years) or lack of experience with certain stacks.",cscareerquestions,1637012935

71,Comparing remote and in-person offers,"I'm currently a graduating senior in the robotics field who has accumulated about 6 job offers and am now looking to decide between them. Most of my offers are robotics start ups in the ATL area who offer the opportunity to work remote with competitive salary for the area (100k base + equity). At first, I was pretty content with working remotely in ATL, as I own a condo and the cost of living is fairly low, but I've recently been informed that I've passed the final interviews at Nvidia and that they're putting together an official job offer soon. The job will be based in Santa Clara and I will have to move there within a few months of accepting the offer.   


My question therefore is, how do you evaluate job offers in different locations? And how much would you value having a big name like Nvidia on your resume? I know I could research cost of living and make adjustments from there (about 60%), but there's still this component of having to move into an entire new area where I wouldn't know anyone. For some more context, I'm currently living with my GF and she expressed that she would be okay with moving to Santa Clara, however she's not graduating for another year so we'd have to go long distance in the meantime.  


I think I would be better off mentally taking the remote position but my heart is telling me to go to Nvidia. I did some research on NCG pay for NVidia and found it to be between 140-160k but I'm hoping to be able to leverage my competing offers and past experience to negotiate close to the 180k range. I'm currently scratching my head as to what the best option for me would be or how to weight these differences. I would love to hear any opinions!",cscareerquestions,1637011848
72,"I quit my career to go to a bootcamp, and just started a full-time job. For anyone else trying to get into CS Careers, I believe in you! Here's my stats.","**Disclaimer:**  
This post is just meant to encourage people who are trying to get into a CS Career, either as a school grad or bootcamp grad, and are feeling discouraged.  I'll be sharing my experiences and stats through the job application process, and stuff I think could help.  

My point-of-view will be described from getting into Full Stack Web Development.  Feel free to AMA! 

**About Me:**

* I quit my job in March to totally switch up careers and go to a bootcamp, with hopes of getting a job ASAP.  My career before I quit was Executive Assistance, with 9 YoE, TC was $67.5k salary. 
* Though I have my AAS, it's from 2009 and I've literally \*never\* held a job in a CS field, nor had any formal Software Development schooling before this year.  At this point is more of a formality than anything I could lean on solidly, but I acknowledge it's benefit on paper. 
* I'm 33 y/o, live in Minnesota USA, and attended a local bootcamp program that started in late-March.  I graduated from it in mid-August and started a full-time job at the start of November.  
* Before this year, I had some some courses on Codecademy, and taken some intro coding lessons -- but that was it.  I could maybe tell you some HTML elements.  My school program was very fast paced, and by the end of it I had built two complete web apps from the ground up. 
* Current TC is $55k salary for a 3-month probationary period, then $60k salary after.  

**The Job Hunt:**

* Not going to lie, it was tough.  I would agree with the sentiment that the new grad/entry-level hiring field is saturated -- but take that with a grain of salt, as I see my school churn out new grads every two months. 
* I used huntr.co to track all applications, status, etc., so can confidently report these numbers to a good accuracy.  
* I applied to over 220 postings over the 2.5 month period before I received an offer.  Out of that, I had roughly 25 interviews (not counting initial phone screenings, only video meetings/etc.), and roughly 8 take-home assessments/challenges/etc.  There was probably 4-5 interview series where I made it to the final stages but wasn't selected.  
* Honestly, I'd consider the above stats a mid-to-fast timeline for recent grads.  I'm about in the middle of my graduating class to get employed -- I know people who've done it faster, and people who are still looking. 

**Things That Helped Me:**

* These are specific to me and my scenario, but wanted to share them anyways. 
* Part-time gig: My school links us with clients and one of the capstone graduation projects is building a live application for them in real-world use for their needs (for free).  After my team graduated, our client 'hired' us on as contractors to keep the app going and add new features.  I quote 'hired' because since we're fresh grads, we quote our work at dirt cheap prices, but it's a great resume builder.  Basically I can say I'm 'freelance team lead' since graduation, when it's actually only been like 50 hours of work over three months.  
* Part-time Gig: I also accepted a part-time gig (\~4 hours or less a week) in October doing contract Code Review for their current students code.  Again, a great resume builder.  
* Volunteer Work: I'm in a mentorship program with my school.  It's only one hour a night every other week, and it's cool to see how fresh students are doing.  Again, a great resume builder.
* I'm continuing to do all of the above in addition to my FTE. 

**Things I Know Very Well:**

* Web development &amp; Restful API's. 
* React/Redux/Saga, PostgreSQL, Material-UI, and GitHub.
* Documentation and written skills.  Helped my resume and portfolio stand out, IMO. 
* Relaxed and friendly teamwork. 

**Things I Wish I Knew Better (aka, Experience That Would've Helped the Job Hunt):**

* Object-oriented programming (TypeScript, C#, etc.). 
* All forms of testing (unit, integration, automated, etc.). 
* Cloud services (AWS, etc.). 

**My Advice To Other Junior/Entry-Level/New Grad Developers:**

* Find a way to make yourself different from the rest of your classmates, and fast!  IMO the best way to do that would be learning different/other in-demand tech stacks or languages, but it could very well be a good story for why you're here now too. 
* Keep your LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, and GitHub ***polished and in-sync!***  If you don't have each one of those things, I'd recommend building them out.  Every new application I built goes onto my Portfolio and GitHub profile.  All new experience goes onto my LinkedIn and resume.  Make sure your written skills convey what you want to! 
* Apply, apply, apply!  When you're fresh outta school, it's a numbers game.  Hit every posting on the job sites, but if it's a job you ***really want***, also go to the company's direct website and look at their careers page to apply there.  Hundreds of people hit the Indeed posting, but maybe only tens hit the careers page, so you'll have better odds. 
* Do small things that can help build your resume and portfolio.  Take small gigs, volunteer to mentor other grads, build small projects, just do whatever to show people you're out there learning and coding.  
* Lean on your alumni community!  Go to the meet-ups, network, and make friends who are in similar situations or careers.  It's now always *what* you know, but *who* you know that could be the deciding factor.  

**My Questions To More Experience Developers:**

* Since this is the Reddit hive mind, I'll take answers with a grain of salt, but I'm curious on the following: 
* Do you get annoyed with your companies tech stat, or rather, do you wish they'd use something you really like?  If so, how do you handle that? 

Of course, take everything I have to say with a grain of salt too.  Skills, luck, and determination will play a lot more into your search than my stories could.  Thanks for reading, and good luck!",cscareerquestions,1637011569

I have two job offers right now:

One is Qualcomm return offer:

\~100k base + 25k sign on + 10k relocation + 40k stock / yr (starting after 1st year) and 10k retention bonus if i stay at least 2 years. Qualcomm also gives a yearly bonus based on performance which would include cash and stocks granting over 4 years. This is in San Diego.

\~140k TC

The Unicorn is offering 140k base and 10% guarenteed yearly bonus and 5k relocation. This is after negotiation, I probably could have asked for more but the ship has sailed. They wouldn't budge on sign on bonus. They are also giving some stock options which I am not including as part of my evaluation because the options have a chance to be worthless. The unicorn is worth about 1.5-3B right now. They have gone through many rounds of funding and the lastest one raised a couple hundred million dollars so I think they are probably not too risky to be at.

If the company 2x'd then the options would be worth about 15k a year so it is not much. It is vesting over 4 years and they only give a refresher every 3 years right now. The startup is around the Mountain View Area.

\~154k TC 

Which looks better? San Diego has a cheaper cost of living, but I would be doing work on embedded systems which I think would pigeonhole me. My manager and techlead for Qualcomm was awesome though. I am also worried because Qualcomm has career slow growth which is based on YoE, whereas the startup seems like it provides much more growth. The guy interviewing me at the startup got two promotions in 3 years. At the startup, I would be doing work on distributed systems, ML/AI, and AWS, which I think is more interesting and would help me grow as an engineer more than sticking with Qualcomm. I think Qualcomm is worth more money, but I'm not sure if it would be the best choice career wise.",cscareerquestions,1637003717
96,I feel like I was hired just to fix some CSS,"I work in my company for two years now. I got quite decent experience on both sides (frontend and backend) and so far I absolutely loved my job but wanted to find a new challenge after the last few projects.  Because of that, I applied to a different team at work - the job sounded exciting, interesting, with cool collaborations.

So from the very beginning, I knew that there was something wrong - engineers with who I spoke during interviews apparently weren't the ones with which I finished working. The HR recruiter who was taking care of my interview process told me that I basically don't deserve a higher salary and I am not that good, but they will still hire me in the new team.

I was a bit shocked, cause in the previous team I was getting very positive feedback, I won some hackathons outside work,  I had my own projects, I was mentoring other team members - overall I felt pretty confident. And when I was doing my interview, the engineers which been interviewing me seemed to be happy with me and my solutions (I think there was a problem with only one of the tasks). 

I decided to ignore that, cause I thought that moving to this new team will be great for my career.

I was utterly wrong. The role was advertised as a full-stack but in practice, it turned out that they just needed somebody to sort some CSS for them. My supervisor doesn't know anything about me and my experience, outside that I had some frontend knowledge. I decided to be optimistic, thinking that maybe over time I will be able to prove that I am more than that, but NO. 

It got even worst: one of the seniors is micromanaging me so I cannot even do more complex stuff, majority of my tickets are: fix heading, fix padding. I feel like I literally stopped progressing. When I got an opportunity to move to a different team, I wasn't allowed to do so. My days are basically 3 hours of work and the rest are pointless meetings that could be easily done via email.

There is lots of favouriting and huge egos. Every day after work I just want to lay down, read a book, go to the gym or spend time with friends. Being bored makes me tired. I see changes in how I perceive myself. I complain all the time, I feel tired all the time and dumb. If I speak up during some meetings, I am totally ignored, and often treated like I can hardly do whatever tasks I am doing now. One engineer acts like I cannot code, and the other one like I cannot read. I hate that.

I have a few options: try to go back to my previous team (although this does feel like a failure) or apply to a different company and hope for the best. For that, though I need time to prepare myself and lots of luck. I feel like a few months before I started in this new team, every week I was using a whole range of different skills - SQL, React, AWS, Node. Now I am just bored and usually doing the same mundane tasks every day, cause no one else is able and wants to finish them and I am not allowed to pick up different tickets.

 Should I wait and give it more time, should I change teams or find a new job? Am I overly dramatic by feeling so disappointed with the new team and responsibilities?

98,"Frustrated on being ghosted after a take-home project. How do I follow up on specific, tangible feedback as to why so I can learn and not waste my time in the future","**TL:DR:** went through 3 rounds of interviews over the course of a several weeks. All the feedback was very positive along the way, including the technicals. At the end they asked me to complete a take-home and got rejected. Not upset at the rejection so much as the fact that I wasted hours of my time for quite literally 0 feedback or explanation. How do I follow up to get actual tangible feedback so I can improve my coding?



I was reached out by a recruited from a pretty reputable company with a lot of positive things going for them. Was very excited going into it. Even though I was primarily an Angular developer, and this was a React role, they assured me that that wouldn't be an issue since I was currently learning the framework, and their legacy code was in Angular so it would actually be helpful.


I go through two 1-hour technicals with their senior devs and an hour with the CTO, and the feedback right after was very positive. They even said that as the next-steps, there would just need to be a follow-up culture fit interview and then the final decision. However, when they asked me to complete a take home assignment I was caught off guard a bit, but assumed that it came down to me and some other candidate and they needed a tie-breaker. I was hesitant to go through it because I was anticipating exactly this, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because I was excited about this company and wanted to stand out. 


It wasn't a difficult project at all, simple SPA using their API, make it searchable and filterable, etc using some specific React libraries and a very open ended deign requirement to ""showcase my artistic side"". Regardless of how simple though, it still took several hours to learn these libraries, come up with a logical UI and troubleshoot and test before sending it over. I hit all of their technical requirements.


I get an email back with very minimal feedback on the project (""We've all been there and you just need to fine-tune your code"") and a lot of fluff on offering to help me with my career progression/code review/advice and offering to contact me with future job openings. I was very cordial in my response, thanking them for their time and taking them up on their offer to receive the feedback since I am honestly trying to improve and figure out where I went wrong. Haven't heard back and it's been over a week. 


Honestly very discouraged to go through any more interviews that require take-homes even if it means passing up a great opportunity. How do I follow up again asking for tangible feedback without seeming desperate?",cscareerquestions,1637001277

10,Has anyone ever used an existing offer to expedite the process at another company?," Hi all,

I just recently received an offer from company A, but since I've only been passively sending out my resume, I am not far in the interview process with any other company. I completed an OA from Company B 6 days ago and passed with 100% (it was on Codility so I was able to see my score). Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from the recruiter at company B yet.

The position at company B is much more attractive to me. Not only is the company more established, the role itself is a lot more interesting, and while Company A's offer is competitive, they are a pre-IPO startup and relatively unknown.

Would it be considered rude to use Company A's offer to nudge the recruiter from Company B? I realize that I am not even at the phone screen stage yet, having only completed an OA, so Company B might not even be considering my candidature at all.

I'm also half tempted to reject Company A's offer and keep looking, since I haven't even started actively applying yet and my current job is really comfortable (I'm looking to leave ASAP).

**TLDR:** An offer came extremely early in my job search process, but I'd still like to interview with better companies.

Everything has been fine until a few weeks ago when things have gotten a bit... strange. Our teams' manager suddenly stopped showing up to team meetings. We will send him emails and chat messages that will go ignored. The only time we will really talk to him is if he reaches out to us directly asking a question or to point out a maintenance-related issue.

24,Are These LinkedIn Scams?,"I recently updated my LinkedIn to include more computer science/technology content, and since then, I've noticed some trends in sketchy LinkedIn messages/connections requests I get. I'm looking for feedback to help determine whether these are scams or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some patterns I've noticed:

&amp;#x200B;

1) ""Let's collaborate on UpWork; I'll buy you a computer so I can remotely log in behind your firewall""

I've had several people contact me (or friends of mine) with a proposal to collaborate on UpWork. They then claim that since they're not based in the US, they need to have remote access to a computer in the US to work off of. They offer to buy a cheap computer and ship it to my address, which they will then remotely access. I'm 99.9% sure this is a scam; I'm assuming it's so they have someone's firewall to hide behind while they do off-book hacking. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

2) ""Technologist | Humanitarian Aid Expert | Aspiring Angel Investor | Coding Guru""

I've had connection requests from about a dozen accounts with some combination of the above in their tagline. The accounts are always the same: created in the past 2-3 months, all activity is them re-posting articles from Ars Technica, HackerNews, or other technology news websites. They're all female and have a similar generic school photo, 8-12 years of experience, and don't actually interact with anyone on LinkedIn. Seems sketchy, but they never try to message me so my best guess is perhaps it's some sort of Machine Learning experiment.

&amp;#x200B;

3) ""I'm an engineering manager and I need someone to interview clients while my engineers are busy""

Usually, the pitch is something along the lines of ""my engineers are all non-native English speakers, so I need someone to speak for them."" Sometimes, the request even mentions pretending to be another member of the team (""you'll pretend to be me for the interview"" or some such). Is this a scam intended to take advantage of me, or just a poorly thought-out business plan which involves being dishonest to potential clients?

38,"As a college sophomore, how hard exactly do I need to be working?","**TLDR: Just look at the bullet-pointed questions below**

Scrolling through this subreddit makes me really anxious, and it makes me feel like I'm not even doing the bare minimum to get a job after graduating. It doesn't help that I've also seen people on this sub who graduated from the same college I'm attending, and who have better resumes than me, who are having trouble getting a job. I think I need a sort of wake-up call on how much stuff I really need to be doing right now to measure myself accurately.

So far, I've mainly just been focusing on classes. I have a 4.0 right now, and I'm also pursuing a double major (statistics). I've completed a couple personal projects, but they're nothing compared to what other people make. I'm in 2 clubs, but they're more finance-related (kinda interested in quant...). I've barely done any Leetcode; I bought an online course this past summer that sort of prepares you for Leetcode, but I only did like 10% of it, and I haven't been working on it since classes started. I had a really jank unpaid internship in the summer too that didn't even involve much coding. I've applied to like 15 internships so far this semester, and I'm about to have my first interview tomorrow. 

I basically don't talk to literally anyone, so I have no idea how to gauge myself relative to other people in my class. I feel like I'm sort of living under a rock, completely oblivious to just how hard my competitors are working.

So, to all the fellow college students here, and also the grads who got jobs right after their 4th year, I would like to know the specifics of how hard you are working or did work throughout your undergrad. And by specifics, I mean ideally down to your daily schedule.

* How often exactly do you Leetcode? What year in college did you start doing it? How many hours did you do it everyday?
* How many personal projects did you complete in undergrad? Did you have some sort of schedule for how you completed them? Were you always working on one in your free time? Did you try to complete one project every month? How exactly did you organize your day to make room for personal projects? Did you treat it like homework and work a bit on it everyday after you finished studying for the day?
* How many internships did you apply to? What year in college and month did you start applying? How many apps did you send out every day? 
* How often did you take advantage of career resources? Did you attend every single career fair? How many versions of your resume or cover letter did you have, and how often did you get them checked by a college career advisor?

42,Having Trouble Communicating with Boss about CS Related Work Flow &amp; Procedures,"Be me, graduate from college with CS degree, interview for 6 months without a solid offer, finally find a start-up paying near minimum wage ($15/hour after tax), give-in and just take the position so I can get some work experience on the resume, be here for 6 months &amp; just absolutely miserable.

Basically, boss-man comes from a more hardware installation type work background, but decided to get into Wordpress Websites &amp; Application Development. His philosophy seems to suggest that development is linear, straight-forward path where if the project is estimated to be 10 steps long, all we have to do is complete 1 step a day for 10 days in order to finish the project. 

Meanwhile, he hired me (purposefully looking for young fresh-out-of-college talent because he knows we are cheaper &amp; more willing to explore newer technologies, yes he told me this himself).

Did I forget to mention, I'm the only software developer in this company that is only 3 people large?

So basically we don't have team meetings because there is no team, it's just me developing on technologies I've never used (not a big deal, but clearly there is a steep learning curve on your first time developing on Google's Flutter, Google Cloud Platform and AWS Amazon Web Services).

But its a startup, and hes just a dude with money &amp; a dream, so that's all fine and good. I understand the situation I accidentally, or not accidentally found myself in. So I sit here, get paid to learn new technologies and stuff the resume with work experience.

But the boss-man is constantly hounding me &amp; micromanaging me, asking if its done yet. I try to communicate these things: I'm a new college grad, yes I am learning these new technologies, no the pyramids weren't constructed overnight, my only resources are documentation, reddit &amp; stack overflow, I don't have another developer in the office to talk with, the office is lifeless &amp; crippling my creativity.

So basically boss-man is a big walking red-flag, but I got my work experience now, learned Cloud Technologies &amp; some application building full-stack skills. Hoping the hardest part is over &amp; I can find the courage to leave this place. 

Unfortunately for boss-man I'm the only developer here, so if I leave his projects unfinished, he is just completely fucked. I have plenty of comments in my code, it was all developed in a Git VCS, I've written  some 100 pages of documentation of the past 6 months. But I am not heartless, and still feel bad for wanting to abandon this project before completion, but I am just starting to fear this will ultimately sour my taste &amp; passion for CS. 

Even if this posts gets downvoted into oblivion or removed by mods, I am super proud of myself for coming this far. In the South East United States, by the way. So I know plenty of opportunity is ahead. Just need to stay optimistic &amp; grow as a developer.

59,"I am going to dropout college because of my job, am i doing wrong?","First of all i know this question asked like billon time in this subreddit, let me tell my story , my story is  little bit different than other stories.  
I live in Turkey and 21 years old i want to become computer engineer since like i was 3 years old. I do some freelancer works when i am in high school (i use the school computers for doing freelancer works and i made enough money for getting a laptop) I've never been good at school. Therefore I couldn't go to a good college.    


I study statistics and computer science at average college (shitty province that's how i getting accepted from a university and nobody wants study the statistics with computer science) when i was in college at first semester i focused my classes and got 3.6 GPA but it didn't make me feel good. my brain works pragmatic i don't like the theoretical very hard math especially mixed with statistics , the aim of this department is not to train computer engineers, their aim is train statisticians who can use computers.  I fell into depression when this reality hit me.   


I just wanna be engineer not the statistician i can't apply for ceng because of my shitty grades in high school and u have to work for university placement exam like 1 years, anyway during the pandemic our college turn to online.  


at this time i applied for jobs because i need the money for living (btw, youth unemployment is %30 in turkey)  a company liked my resume. and run a interview after the interview I got the job but start with low salary. and they worked with the kafka for data streaming to millions iot devices.  


 i make great optimizations on there and I delivered the works before the deadline. They liked me so much and so surprised to my work thus at the end of 3 months they give me %50 raise after 6 months another %50 raise and today my first year at the job and they gave another %50 too, everything is perfect I was able to go on vacation and buy what I wanted. (before the job my monthly income is just 60€)  


 but now there is a problem I can't go to college because I work (50+ hours at a week and sometimes up to 70+) so I have midterm exams in 1 week and I didn't even study for a day. It is impossible for me to finish this college while I am working because we are going through very difficult exams. on the other hand  my main goal is move to USA, without a degree i can't get any visa sponsorship from companies but if i decide the go to the college, I won't be happy and  gonna be penniless  


so, I am very confused. there doesn't seem to be a good choice here I don't know what to do,  do you think I should go back to the school I don't like despite everything, or should I continue with my job?   


:) Thanks for readers of my wall of text   


TL;DR: I live in Turkey (where the average salary is 300 euro)  I can't study to computer science because of my shitty grades in high school Therefore i study the statistics and computer science but i am not happy in there i have a great job now. but i can't finish my college because of  i work if i decide go to the college i can have degree after 2 years and i can use for move to the usa but  i am gonna be broke and unhappy.

60,CMV: Engineering is a better career path than HFT/Quant trader,"The question may sound weird and a bit out-of-the-blue, but please understand I am in no way trying to belittle anyone's career choice or just anyone at all. I just have some opinions that I thought I would get the community's thoughts on because I feel rather strongly about them, and for some reason lot of people don't hold these opinions which intrigues me and I want to understand their viewpoint.

So, I am a final year undergrad at tier 1 CS school graduating this year. As you know, for students intending to pursue a corporate career, the two primary options for CS graduates at this point are in engineering (classical) or, I feel more recently, in Quantitative Trading (HFTs small and big, IBs and others shops). It is no surprise that while both the careers pay handsomely well, quant/trading roles obviously pay much more (on average), sometimes disproportionately more if you land up in a big name HFT. I've heard people making over a million past 6-7 YOE in HFTs and retiring in their early 30s or less. Okay, that may be a exaggeration, or just nitpicking top performers and extrapolating, but even on average it is a given that quant roles pay way more than their engineering counterparts.

With that out of the way, I want to get to the main substance of my argument. Trading (algorithmic or otherwise), in short term, is a zero-sum game. Money is not getting generated, whatever you make out of your trades comes from someone else's pockets directly (precisely someone who you outsmarted with your trades). Well obviously it's not stealing, and I am not saying otherwise, the trade is voluntary but still my point stands - the money is not getting generated. There is no value being generated. Contrast this with classical engineering roles in which, as an engineer, you offer your services for betterment of someone and get paid in return for the services offered. This sounds like a more honest, or virtuous or whatever the right word may be kind of deal. My services can be misused, granted, but I still have the choice of whom I offer my service. I have many corporations to choose from and many viable domains/positions to select from which makes the task easier. In trading, however, there are no two ways about it, it's always a zero-sum no value generating deal.

Thus, I do not understand why would you want to willingly go for a trading role? Yes yes yes yes there's money, tons of it -- but typically if you are good enough to land a worthy quant role, you are also good enough to land a top engineering job. So it feels to me that the *extra* money that you net from a trading role, given that income has diminishing marginal returns, is not that attractive once you are already making shit tons of money as a high-demand engineer. Am I being naive here? Or just being too righteous with my shit?

66,Is it normal that I'm so slow to produce code ?,"Hello !   


So I'm doubting hard about my skills and my intellect.   


I started to code when I was a kid about, 11/12 years. Started with Html, javascript, java. I built some basic website really fast at that time, around year 2000. Somehow I dropped from CS during my teenage. After failing everything at university and chilling for 5 years after that (as I'm really not a hardworking guy lol ) , I got back to IT as it's the only thing that is worth money I can do. I found a job in a big company as an IT, Linux server management, some scripting with Python. I kinda lied during the whole interview process about my knowledge as everything I was spitting out was stuff I learned in the couple of weeks before the itw.  
But it worked.  


After 1.5 year I left my job as I was bored as hell after 6 months. I get bored really fast.   
So I found a shitty job as an IT again with some dev in Java, SQL on an ERP.   
Anyway, worst job ever. I left after 1 year.  


After that I did a .NET training for a year in a center in my city. They provide very good training, I got a couple of microsoft certification but I hated .NET.  So in the meanwhile I learned basics of Python and Django ( did a couple of courses on Udemy ) .  


So after that I found a job as developer in a aerospace research center. My job was nothing related to aerospace, I was working on the internal tools. They provide master classes for the interns but also for the public. So my mission was to build this application with Django to sell to the public the master classes, register them, follow the billing process etc etc... So a webshop, with a event management system. The secretary had to update the site by themselves ( add the event, set the price, register the participants to the event etc etc ).  It was my first Django app ever ( except the one from the udemy course ). They knew I was a junior. It took me 7 months to do the entire app. I learned react at the same time as the frontend had to be dynamic.

It was not an easy case. I had to create different type of users, some coming from LDAP, others from registration by mail. Create all the webshop process, registration to the events, user panel to manage their profile, purchase followup, create the invoices, paiment reminder cronjobs, support all the paiment process possible ( paypal, credit card and others ) , invoice sent by mail, confirmation, notification to the accountant department and also a CMS so the secretary could update, modify everything. I did that all alone and they still use my app atm.   


So for the first time of my life I was not bored by a job and I was happy with what I was doing. But they were not. It took too much time for them, and there was some bugs ( honneslty minor bugs, and mainly on the administration side and not on the customer side ) . But I really did my best.   
So I got a second project to work on ( the dashboard of students / PHD on site for their exams, classes etc... Like the dashboard we have at university ). I was working alone again on this one.    
To be honnest I was so proud of this one. The UI was awesome, I applyed everything I knew from my last project and I was really proud of how it was going... But Again I was too slow for them.   
So at the end of the project they fired me. They still use my apps and outsourced my job. They pay some dude in Algeria (probably at -80% of my rates ) to maintain my apps.   


I went into depression after that and I felt like I would be rejected from any job. So I didn't even bother to search for a new one for 6 months. But I found on linkedin something interesting as they use Django and React ( I really love working with both ). After 3 interviews, I got the job. They read some of my code on project  I've done and technical screening.  I will start soon there.

But I'm scared AF to be too slow again and get fired. I know how things works but I lose time on stupids things sometimes or I have to look around on how to do "" that or that "" as I don't remember.   
Maybe I'm just too dumb for programming, I don't know...

""The BS in Computer Science (BS in CS) is heavy in math and science courses and the BA in Computer Science (BA in CS) is not. Some courses that are required for the BS in CS that are not required for the BA in CS is: Calculus1, Calculus 2, Physics with Calculus 1, Physics with Calculus 2 and Senior Project. Also, the BS in CS degree is accredited by ABET and the BA in CS degree is not.""

What caught my attention is that the only math pre-requisite that's required for the BA is PreCalculus, which would save me a lot of time. I find this path very attractive because of this.

80,Fresh junior needs advice,"I'm worried I'm nearing burnout and I don't know what to do.

I've been working as a junior full stack wordpress developer for 3 months now. I feel like I haven't learned much and I'm constantly being assigned task I have no idea what to do. My bosses seem happy with me but to be straight, I'm not happy with my job. My boss hired me after I interned because he says I have a passion, and motivation he's only seen a few times in over 20 years. He knows I prefer React and Express over WP, and he promised me that I would be using React/Gatsby ""soon"".

After relaxing a little bit after I started working for him I have since doubled down on using React on any/all of my free time. My typical day; I start work at 9am ends at 5pm. I usually turn off my work laptop and immediately turn on my personal one and start doing something in React, Express, or both. Then I'll stop around 7 for dinner and to watch a TV show with my wife and child then back on until 1 or 2 am. Go to sleep and repeat.

I just realized the other day, I'm feeling burned out and worried if something doesn't change I'm gonna lose all motivation to work at all. I've had a few recruiters reach out to me because of my experience with LAMP and PHP, but I feel like I would be in the same boat. It's just not what I want to do right now. I've applied to quite a few React positions but haven't got an interview lately so I'm starting to feel depressed on top of burned out.

84,Burnout or something else?,"I decided to post here in the hopes that someone has gone through something similar and has any good news for me. Is this burnout or something else?

So i'm going to start with where i currently am at the moment. I'm 33, mid-level engineer, working at a mid-sized company that i joined about 9 months ago. Unfortunately i had to start this role with a severe burnout caused by my toxic last role, and so as you can imagine, my superiors weren't exactly impressed with my work ethic, and i haven't really worked on any big projects or anything (unlike in my last roles), even though i do have some good wins from time to time, like studying a specific technology and improving or fixing something vital for our platform, etc. However overall, it is absolutely obvious that i'm not working to my full capacity, and if anything, i'm surprised i didn't get fired yet.

When i first started it was at its worst, and because it's remotely, i would literally not be able to sit in front of the laptop altogether, all i wanted to do was get some food, watch some TV and sleep, no hard thinking or anything, which took quite the toll on my journey with this company.

Now things are much much better! i think the main thing is that i persevered, and my boss cut me slack, without really understanding, i guess to him it just seems like a life crisis or something.

So now i'm generally able to work more, and i've also been studying on and off, but generally i've studied more Udemy courses than i did in the last 3 years combined, which is of course great, and some days i work so hard all day, but most days are still slow, and to this day some days no work gets done at all!!

I really want to close the gap and be able to ask for the senior promotion, which i know i can rightfully ask for as i've been doing this for 6 years, if only i could work hard and deliver consistently for just 2-3 months, then i can dare and utter those words in front of my manager, otherwise i'm screwed.

On most days what happens is i don't work for a few days, then i get so anxious about the lack of work i've been doing, and i go and just attack everything and finish it all in one day.

If only my boss could know that most projects don't really take me 2-3 weeks to complete, but only literally 2-3 days, instead he just doesn't take me seriously at all, which i can't really blame him for.

Here's what i've tried so far, i've been to therapy, did not help, but i will try a different one soon. I also tried reading some books, like ""The War of Art"" which was really great and changed how i think, but i'm still suffering.

3,What is the truth: Conflicting information regarding the benefits and ramifications of using a job recruiter (TEKsystems etc). Can they really take up to 40% of your salary and several other questions?,"Hi everyone,

I’m getting conflicting information online about recruiters and wanted to see if someone could offer some clarification before making a decision, I potentially regret. (For brevity, TEKSystems will be abbreviated TKS)   


Quick background: I have been a program manager in the defense industry for the last several years. I have helped build all kinds of hardware systems from radios to aerospace to weapon components. I have only worked in small privately owned companies in SoCal. For the most part I have been happy with my income which after about a decade in the industry has gotten to $95k. I have stayed at this salary for the last 4 years and our company owner, does not like to give raises. We have senior design engineers that are geniuses and one told me he has been at $110k for the last 10 years. Personally, I have not needed more to be happy and can cover all my expenses and save with this income. (Single, No Kids) As I have gotten older, recently turning 41, I have wanted to purchase a home of my own and stop renting and sort of keep up with my friends, most of which own homes. In addition to this, I have also had some hard conversations with my close friends (which work in varying jobs), and they average $150-250k per year which is making me feel a bit behind. I know comparison it toxic but putting that aside, I would also like to feel like I’m growing. (One of my friends first year as a Project Mgr at one of the large social media firms told me she makes $156k before her bonus. When I was a Project Mgr I was making $65k with my bonus. This really upset me, but that’s software vs hardware even though I managed multiple multimillion dollar projects as well). Getting back to it…    
 

A friend of mine that works at FBook told me I need to get out of hardware and into software because that is where the money is. This is obviously challenging when I have very limited experience in software (about 5 months on a small project). To help bridge this gap I just completed a 6-month Product Mgt course at a reputable university. After completing the certification, one of the course leaders, knowing I wanted to move to software, reached out and asked if I would be interested in a position they knew about. I responded absolutely, and they proceeded to connect me with a recruiter from TEKsystems (TKS). The recruiter emailed me a description of the job which included the name of the hiring company, and the hiring manager. The company is a defense contractor which has a contract with the government building a software system and the life of the contract is 3 years with possible extension. The job is for a Development Product Owner (Software). Because the companies I have worked at have been small, we have not used any type of application lifecycle management software like JIRA or Version One, etc. We also never used SCRUM or Scaled Agile Framworks (SAFe). These things are however posted on the job description. My only exposure to them has been in the course I completed.   

I checked the hiring company’s website, and the job is posted on there, however without the salary information. On the TKS website, they have the same job description with a salary posted ($50 to $55 per hour). A day before the meeting with the recruiter it dawned on me that someone I met at an event, worked for a recruiting firm. I proceeded to contact them to pick their brain, and he told me that I would do myself a huge disservice by utilizing the recruiter.   
 

**As an acquaintance he said, he was going to give me the inside scoop and said the following:**

1) If clients (job seekers) knew that we (recruiters) charge hiring companies $30 to $40 per hour on top of their salary and this is money they are potentially losing from their salary, they would never use us. (He hires for typically $100+ per hour employees for Salesforce).  
 2) My salary would be between 20-40% less if I were to apply through the recruiter &amp; benefits would be also likely affected  
 3) I have a smaller chance of being hired through them vs applying directly because there is already a premium on top of my head before even walking in the door  
 4) TKS will own me. He said, what he means by this is, his firm charges 500% annual salary if the hiring company wants to make me a permanent employee. He said most companies will not pay that amount, so you essentially stay TKS property, so to speak.  
 5) If I get hired at a lower salary say at $55 per hour vs $70 per hour, that $15 less per hour, is for 3 years. That means I will lose $31,200 per year for 3 years or close to $100k!!  
 6) I get lower raises because I get paid less  


**What he suggested I do:**

1) Cancel the meeting with the recruiter (which I already did, to give me time to think)  
 2) Apply directly to the company since I have the name and hiring manager’s name. He said since the recruiter does not have your C.V. they cannot try and claim credit on you  
 3) If you do not hear back from the company within a week, I can try to follow up and if nothing in a few days post that, can go back to the recruiter if I really want the job.  
 

**A friends mother was a recruiter for 30 years and I also spoke with her. She told me the following:**  
 1) It would be unethical to go around the recruiter since he provided me the job info (which included the company name and hiring managers name). I can see the point she makes; however, the recruiter would also not tell me I am going to be out 20-40% of potential wages for using them. I can absolutely see the value that a recruiter can bring such as coaching and simply getting you through the door. However, I do not agree if there is an ongoing fee beyond the first year and one that could potentially equate to close to $100k in income over a 3-year period. This is not to forget the possible lack of benefits etc. that might also follow.   
 2) She also stated that my salary would not be affected by the recruiter and that typically companies pay a flat recruitment fee or negotiate an annual fee for a set number of candidates. This is the opposite of what my acquaintance said that is also a recruiter vs her whom has been retired for 15years. When I google the average salary of a product owner in Los Angeles, it ranges from $50-$55 per hour so the job description on TKS site is close, but my friend at FB said some companies would pay $80 per hour for a POwner. He also told me that he was hired at a company for $60 per hour and came to accidently see in his file, he was on paper being paid $95 per hour. He used a recruiter.   
 3) She said that the recruiter would potentially negotiate a higher salary for me or help encourage me to get a higher salary because his commission is based on a higher salary, (but its capped on the TKS site).  
 4) If by chance the company were to find out that I went around the recruiter, that I would walk in the door seeming shady or slimy and that would stick with me and do me a disservice. I asked her wouldn’t the company be happy that I saved them the recruitment fee, especially if I end up accepting a lower offer than the fee they would have paid the recruiter? She stated they would not.   
 

Reading the job description if I had come across it personally, I would have never considered applying for it. I do not feel that I am qualified for it, however as the course leader is the one who said I would be able to function properly in the position (he is a senior technical product manager) I'm going on whim and trusting his opinion. I really want to get into software (especially something related to the metaverse or crypto lol). He also said the job description is a wish list and that I could learn it as I go. Part of me wants to utilize the recruiter because he may be able to get me into software where I might fail on my own. But that potentially comes at a huge loss in salary for 3 years or more. The other half of me wants to apply, myself, and see if I can get the job and negotiate a better salary. 

Thoughts would be immensely appreciated!",cscareerquestions,1636953749

http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2015/12/learn-to-code-its-harder-than-you-think.html?m=1

And honestly im concerned. Everyone preaches that you have to work super hard and eventually you'll get good however i wonder if its the same with cs. I have realized that cs is NOT just about writing code. Its about mathematically finding solutions in your head 

Comparing my  long programms with the very efficient  and short ones of my classmates makes me wonder if i'll ever get to think like one of them. You can read all programming books you want but at the end of the day your logic will remain unefficient , not enough , mediocre.

Im not the worst student in my class , i can solve problems sadly not elegantly. there's a small group of people that don't have the sligthest idea of  what it feels like to come up with the program in your head. One of them is so so bad that  he seems to not  grasp even the most basic notions of programming after having those being explained to him many many times (so everyone avoids him like the plague when working in teams)  and lemme tell you if i were in his shoes i'd be switching fast af out of cs.

I myself sometimes want to leave it all behind and go have fun with the folks in other departments and tbh im only sticking with cs for the technical skills to transition to ux/ui design  which includes my other passions and talents .

I wanna start getting into ML and AI but I have some questions first,

A) What problems do they both solve? I understand the difference but I don’t understand why wouldn’t we just use ML. AI simulates human behavior and ML uses data to enhance itself and learn from past data. So why wouldn’t we just use ML if it’s constantly improving itself?

B) How to choose between the two? And do I have to learn AI first since ML is a subset from Ai?

C) Do I have to be ninja at Mathematics? I know it’s important and I am good at maths, I love it. Every roadmap I have seen has Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc. when do I say now I am good enough to start ML/AI track?

D) From your experience, is it possible to study ML/AI while working as an iOS Developer? I know that ML track is long so I can’t stop the track I’ve already started and landed a job after a year studying it to start another track from the beginning which is really long to get into.

Not even sure if this is the correct spot to post this but i have a question, i am currently about 5 months into my first position as a full stack engineer at a fairly big company (1000+ employees) and i am ITCHING for more work. Is this something that is common amongst most people?


I get a 5 point / 8 point task and can normally get it done and tested within a couple days and in our case 8 points is a full 2 weeks. I then find myself staring at my test cases for the next 4 days. I get my code reviewed and normally have small changes but for the most part i am performing fine. Towards the end of the day my team logs off and i stay on to try and see if i can pick up another ticket. 

Maybe the stigma of working at larger companies and having 1 small task for a couple of days is true? I was thinking of grabbing a part time SWE job on the side as well to try and scratch my itch. Maybe i am so early in my career and this will ware off? 

I would switch jobs BUT because i dont have much experience it would be wayy to risky on leaving my current position for potentially short term fulfillment. 

I am at the point of starting my own company on the side so i can stay at my current position and have income coming in while i build my company.

Sorry if this post is everywhere i just need someones input.",cscareerquestions,1636946482

20,Seeking advice for first job out of college decision,"Greetings,

I'm finishing my undergrad in December, I currently have two offers. Neither of them are my dream job, but they're what I've got.

Offer 1: a tech consulting company in Chicago. Starting pay is within 20% of six figures, no idea what the increase will be over time. Seemingly great culture and it's a 3 year development program where I will bounce around different teams. They specifically recommend no other endeavors like a Master's during these 3 years. Also I've been advised not to get into a serious relationship because statistically travel doesn't work for them. I don't really want to travel, but the contract requires willingness to travel 80-100%. 

Offer 2: rotational technology program with a financial services firm in Missouri. It's full time but I'm not quite a full-blown employee yet. Starting pay is a little over $60k and after a year they said I'll almost definitely be given an offer and a pay raise. They're also paying for some FINRA licensing and my interviewer said they paid for his MBA. Downsides are less money upfront and I think I'd like Chicago more.

Overall, I'm leaning toward the Missouri job strictly because of the travel. It's not that I'm unwilling, it's just the fear-of-the-unknown. I'm the kind of person who believes in structured free-time. I plan days, weeks, or months in advance. I don't want to have to fly to Topeka or some God-forsaken place every week for months at a time. But no one can guarantee me that's **not** what the job is. The Missouri job also has the perks of getting me into the financial sector, which I don't think is going anywhere soon... Cost of living is definitely a factor, but I think Chicago is the more interesting city, especially for tech anway. The consulting job definitely has the higher upper-bound in terms of cool projects I could get into (the company does have many big-name clients), but I'm sincerely opposed to living in a hotel for weeks on end. That being said, if it's truly what pays off in 3-5 years, then I'll do it with a smile on my face. I don't really plan on being with either company for more than 10 years... 

Last bit of info, I go to one of 3 biggest public schools in the US, I've got a 3.5GPA, and I completed two internships (one in industry, one in research). But none of this attracted the FAANGs or similar companies. So to all of you dear fellow programmers, I humnly ask for your guidance. Thanks.",cscareerquestions,1636945537

Now I tried applying to a bunch of Machine learning jobs and robotics engineer jobs and most of them require me to be doing software engineering in the context of Machine learning/Robotics/Artificial intelligence.   


What this means is that they have someone with a Ph.D in the team who is working as an applied scientist. He builds ""models"" and I productionalize them. Meaning I write code that fetches data, cleans it and feeds it to the model, and take its output to perform some action. This is kind of like being a second-class citizen in those teams.

26,UX Career Questions/Advice,"I'm looking to transition into a technology-based career and happened to come across UX design. I think it's something I may legitimately enjoy doing. What's the most effective way I can start learning about UX design and more importantly, actively use that knowledge? I know I can't ask anyone here for assurances, but I would appreciate any legitimate advice you can give me towards no-bullshit training into this field. I've checked out springboard, which may be the route I end up going, but that price tag makes me wary; I've come across several posts saying that their program isn't exactly the end-all-be-all it makes itself out to be. I can hardly afford to survive on the income I have now so shelling out my saving on something like this is a big deal (at least for me). Obviously, a solid introduction to this field is the most important first step for me to take, but I can't shake this feeling that I need to actually DO something in UX to see if I can make this work. How should I begin to take this path?  

If it matters, I already have a bachelor's degree in biochemistry, which I'm sure is better than not having a degree, but obviously not ideal.

30,Work gradually becomes unrelated to position and department. Thoughts?,"Hi there, I'm currently working as a backend swe with 1.5 YOE, my team is only 2 people. However, recently the work has become increasingly frontend focus. For example, creating a new page in the main website despite there is a front-end department in the company.

The company already has a front-end department (corporate) but somehow our PO and business team just  assign this kind of work for us. I don't mind learning new things but I don't like to work with frontend that much and don't have much experience so I applied for a backend role after I graduated. Right now I'm quite upset of what the work seems to be headed, as not only there is our own service to maintain, but we beed to do this kind of frontend work should the business team and PO want as well (which also has a tight deadline). Plus my manager doesn't seem to mind at all. This makes me kinda burnout since the beginning of the year and want to quit to rest and reskill because my interest is in backend, system, cloud and data engineering but not this kind of field that my team is heading to.

37,Confession: I think a lot of the devs at $company can’t program for toffee,"It’s not limited to the juniors, either.

I’ve got people calling themselves senior developers who are apparently unable to figure anything out unless exact prior art is handed to them on a plate. I’ve got people who respond to queries in code review by pulling you into a call and all but demanding you write their code for them. I’ve got people who flaunt putative “soft skills” and “project management” abilities who seem more interested in drawing up a convincing looking JIRA project than they are in actually figuring out a pathway to production.

This is my first time in a long while working at a large tech company and I’m *appalled*. Working in startups for the best part of a decade I’ve met some weirdos and some developers with serious personality problems, *sure*, but at least they could *program*. These guys seem absolutely allergic to any kind of technical problem solving. Anything that isn’t a piece of JSON plumbing that neatly fits into a three point ticket seems to inflict them with a kind of deep existential distress. They seem seriously upset at the idea of having to do something novel.

The reason we’re hiring so many people is to increase volume. The reason volume is so low is due to poor productivity. The reason productivity is poor is because of a stack of ancient PHP apps that cannot be run locally (nor their tests), where the dev cycle is largely based on pushing changes a few lines at a time to CI machines that take 20-30 minutes to spin up the required tests. It’s appalling, but management can’t get their heads around needing to sponsor a team that isn’t developing products directly, and find a different model for justifying costs to finance.

The juniors themselves are OK but largely unguided. I don’t see them making a lot of progress over time, they seem to slip into niches where they don’t need much support and work in largely unmentored, extremely inefficient ways. No one has time to support them as they’re all stressing out about their PHP changes taking months on end.

It’s absolutely crackers. I have never seen such waste. The company seems to totally undervalue software engineering as a discipline and allow people to reinvent the same wheels over and over because that’s the only thing that’s familiar to them.

I’d like to give my colleagues the benefit of the doubt and argue it’s all down to them being checked out emotionally… but it’s not. They’re actually pretty engaged. About doing everything really badly.

I feel like the senior developers at $company are all thrall to, Jesus, I don’t know, it’s like a collective cognitive impairment of some kind. The other day I was telling someone they could just store things into a relational database and join tables instead of using the crappy platform script YAML DSL to hammer it into DynamoDB and it’s like they just stopped functioning mid-call. I once mentioned to someone they wanted CDCs (consumer driven contracts) and they went on a rant that we shouldn’t use tech just because the Centre For Disease Control used it. This engineer is forty-six years old. I am dead fucking serious.

I don’t know what it is about these dweebs. I am starting to think there really is impostor syndrome in our industry, not people irrationally questioning their ability but rather people who go to work every day and convince themselves they’re doing an adequate job when they’re actually fucking daft.

And I’m sorry if this sounds elitist and gatekeeping. I have tried to be nice and bite my tongue. But I can’t do it any more. These people are lunatics. This company is a body shop. I think my colleagues are all demented.",cscareerquestions,1636935507

39,What steps to get into Machine Learning when a math major?,"Hi,

I'm a math major and I want to get into Machine Learning, especially into the field of Deep Learning. 

I have to say that I had a non-negligible experience  with Python, its data structures, algorithms, OOP... And I think I have a good basis in mathematics that's used in Machine Learning. 

I have been interested in the question a while and tried to gather resources and it seems the 'best' to me are these books:
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop
- Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy
- The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani et Trevor Hastie

I believe these books cover Machine Learning in a rigorous way. Though I have no doubt I'll acquire profound knowledge studying these books, it'll take a long time before finishing them. I wonder if there are ways to acquire more experience while studying these books as ""side studies"". I have the opportunity to do a 6 months internship starting from January 2022 and I'd really like it to be in Machine Learning.

I thought about taking a data science MOOC on Udemy or so to get the basics of Machine Learning and start working with datasets on Kaggle or something as I'm studying the books above, but I wonder if this approach efficient. I wouldn't like to spend time on a MOOC just to find myself with shallow knowledge, having hard time to apply it to real-world scenarios.

I hope someone can enlighten me with its experience.

42,Name and Shame: X by 2. Update after my post a month or so ago about my horrible experience after applying for them.,"This is an update and copy/ pasted from my old post. I’ve decided to name and shame them. I have also since found an amazing permanent wfh company with amazing benefits, culture that’s too good to be true, and salary that’s competitive for the area.

Here’s my old post with some edits for more clarification:

——————————————————————-


Basically, I applied to this small consulting company. They gave a hackerrank followed by a technical portion, a soft skill/technical and a final behavioral portion.

For my background, I graduated in April this year. I started college way back as a Biochemistry major and switched into CS. My course load was lower but in 2017 I fell into a depression and couldn't get much done. I took the classes again and passed but my family fell into financial trouble and the stress made me lower my course load while I worked. I couldn’t just say “I was depressed” but it’s insane they would drill me over this anyway.

Everything was going great and I thought, ""I've developed a lot over the years, I get along with everyone and am hard working, this should be easy."" The gaps can easily be explained with me taking time to focus on my mental health and slowly build up my career, which was true. After graduating I did focus a lot on my career stuff, and while I wasn’t hustling 24/7, my extra gap semester in college was basically work and job applications.

I was totally wrong. The first final portion was with the president and some manager who didn't even go in depth on my internship experience, they drilled me on all my gaps in college and why I was applying to jobs 5 months out of college. Sure, he wasn’t mean about it but he seemed emotionless like a machine drilling me about my past. He didn't seem to have any emotion in his face. I told him I was doing leetcode questions and brushing up on my technical skills here and there since graduation. I always planned on traveling but plans fell through as I thought about focusing on a job more. He asked where I went to highschool and if I was taking part-time college classes or if I was doing anything else on the other end.

The final portion after that was absolutely abyssmal. The manager has been working for the company straight out of college for 20 years and the company linkdin even mentions he has a family member working there. It started off well with a decent conversation but then he absolutely drilled into why it took me 6 years to finish college. I couldn't say I was fucking depressed so I told him I worked part-time and took a lower load after switching majors and taking on two minors out of personal interest and that my dad was switching careers. That seems like a lot right? Well I felt forced to answer it all basically. He was quiet with my answer until he asked me how I handled a stressful situation like that. He even asked me if my parents paid for college.

The absolute worst part was when he asked me why I took 5 months from graduation to start applying for jobs. I told him I wanted to relax for a month and started working on leetcode questions to brush up on my skills. If I didn't want to do questions for a day, I would research topics that I didn't know about. This led to about 90 questions completed and a decent understanding of programming. He told me (kind of respectfully) that it felt like gaming the system in a way to do these questions before hand because the questions asked by them are meant to actually test you. He alluded he wasn’t satisfied with the answer he had doesn’t understand why someone would want to take a gap after college. I told him that I wasn't trying to memorize them but to just understand different algorithms. He clearly doesn't know that the industry asks some of the hardest questions out there and that most candidates need to study them.

It's very clear this guy doesn't even know the industry as he's been on this job for 20 years and switched into management. He told me about this finance podcast he listens to and it just reminds me of toxic hustle culture crap even though I’m an economics minor who enjoys talking finance. I think he actually expected me to find a job immediately out of college and work day and night on job applications, while studying. He was keenly interested on all this despite me passing through all their technical questions with ease. **I'm sorry that I decided to take a more relaxing path to life while working hard on my skills in a reasonable manner.** Is he making assumptions about my class and lifestyle? That just because my parents can support me that I should have still begged to look for jobs instead of becoming a reasonably marketable interviewer?

I can't believe how much I was drilled. I nearly had a meltdown after closing the laptop because: I make friends easy, I work well with teams, and I'm a hard worker. It's clear I have passion and know a lot already and worked towards my goals. I have an internship, personal projects, and I do leetcode on the side. Why am I being judged. I'm just waiting on the rejection email, if they'll even send me that. It ended with a decent convo about his experience in the company when I asked about it.

I can't believe how normal the workers were and how mean this guy was. This guy barely asked me about my internships or projects just straight up about my life decisions and judged over them.

He didn’t even turn on his camera the whole time. Looking into the company they seem super unprofessional.

45,Having a mentor vs trailblazing,"I basically need help deciding whether to make the switch to a new challenge in my career. I had a really good mentor at my current role that left a while ago and since then I have been mostly the lead developer on my team. I only have 1.5 YOE while the other devs on my team have 10+ years. Despite this I am usually the one leading design decisions and also doing other tech lead-y type stuff like managing tech debt, mentoring other developers, working with product on decisions, etc. Although I love the challenge of taking on a larger leadership role, I feel like at this stage in my career it is probably still better to have a mentor that can help me with things only experience can teach.

**With my current role (F100 non-tech company)** 

* 108k base + 15% bonus (almost always guaranteed and typically a little more)
* very laid back WLB 
* work on a high-visibility project  (bonuses and promotions come easier)

**New Offer (Startup in Series C and tech focused)**

* 120k base + 6200 options
* was told it was very laid-back, fully remote
* interviewed with the team I would be on and loved everyone that I talked to and also found people that I could definitely learn a lot from.

59,Advice for Lateral Career Move Away from Accounting (Audit),"Hello All,

I've been in accounting (audit) for about seven years (currently a manager) and feel like I've proven enough to myself in terms of job competence and the ability to work full-time in corporate America. I got off to a rocky start with my first company where another intern accused me of being a diversity hire in conjunction with not really understanding the work I was doing. This situation combined with needing to pay off student loans kept me in audit longer than I should have been. I've known since I started in audit that it wasn't for me, but I stayed for the check and to prove that I could do good work and be recognized in the form of promotions/accolades.

Now that my credit cards are paid off, student loans managed, above average savings/investments for my age etc., it's allowed me these past few months to take a step back and ask myself do I continue on this treadmill in an effort to keep up with the audit joneses or do I hard pivot out of this now that I'm more comfortable and secure in my skin?

So with the backstory out of the way, lately I've wanted to take an extended break at work and go all in on a coding bootcamp to segue into developer work. I've currently been attending a part-time coding bootcamp for the past few months and have done extremely well, the instructors have been impressed and I could probably get a junior dev role that pays half my current salary...and this is probably a better question for the coding sub-reddit, but unfortunately due to my job, I haven't been able to dedicate the time to working on personal coding projects for my portfolio or leetcode to prepare for interviews to set me up the best for whenever I start applying. I would like to take a form of sabbatical for 3-5 months to allow me to attend a full-time 9-5 coding bootcamp and that way I can immerse myself in that world.

The reason I'm posting here is because I don't know the best way to go about asking for this. I am completely fine if I don't get paid for the time I take off, so I was wondering if I could go to HR and request an extended unpaid absence? In my 7+ year career I've never taken off more then three weeks consecutively, plus I've lost some loved ones recently, and not to use their loss as a means to get what I want, but losing them has really made me rethink how I want my life to shape up over the next chapter. I was also considering picking up some contract work from an agency like Robert Half and only get booked for 20 hours of work a week -- that way I'm still taking in some money and my resume isn't gapped.

If anyone's made an abrupt career move out via a bootcamp (e.g., Hack Reactor) please let me know the process you took or advice you may have for me.",cscareerquestions,1636924861

62,Mentoring Pre-juniors,"I'm defining a pre-junior as:

1. A developer currently working towards their CS degree, but has not completed it yet. This degree can be either Bachelors or Masters.
2. Pre-juniors are part-timers (20 hrs) with no benefits. This temporarily changes to full time (40 hrs) with no benefits during the summer months.
3. The pre-junior's time at the company will end when they graduate. The only exception is when they convert to FTE, which is extremely rare.
4. Master pre-juniors tend to last about 1 year. Bachelor pre-juniors can last the full four, though they tend to last around 2 years since keeping them around for 4 years means they enter as freshmen.

I'm looking for tips on how to mentor the pre-juniors so they can be productive for a decent amount of time before they leave. Problems I've encountered:

1. Bachelor pre-juniors, as you would expect, are objectively worse than new grads. If a 4 year pre-junior is hired, then they might not even know some of the basics, like how to set breakpoints in VS.
2. Master pre-juniors know the basics, but they are around for such a short time that their net productivity is rather small.
3. Both don't initially know the things you can really only get from experience, like estimating deadlines, code quality, and talking to customers. They understandably treat the work more like a school assignment.
4. No senior devs, except maybe myself, if you consider the dev team hierarchy. One actual FTE junior dev with benefits, except she also has to deal with school on the side. The rest are a legion of pre-juniors.
5. Pre-juniors are easy come easy go even if they do get hired. A few gave their 2 weeks notice when they only worked here 2 weeks.
6. The dev team took a major blow a few months ago when a bunch of devs graduated at the same time. There was some KT, but the knowledge was so massive, only the most important business-critical pieces could be moved, like the one involving our in-house time off system.
7. I realize this may be a cheap shot, but the junior FTE dev we hired, converted from pre-junior, had trouble with Fizzbuzz. I also had her do [this easy level leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/), which she also had trouble with. She said she never did Leetcode before.

On the flipside:

1. I'd say I have a decent reputation among the dev team. I treat them like how I would treat myself were I my own manager: 
   1. I give them tasks I want them to finish or at least progress on during the week and let them figure out the details.
   2. They tend to come back with questions throughout the week, which detracts from my IC work, but I rationalize that the question answering is part of what the company pays me for.
   3. As long as work gets done, I really do let the implementation of going from A to B up to them. This means I do not enforce in-office despite the company decree, and I otherwise let them do what they want. Code quality is handled during the PR later. One guy said he wanted to work remotely from India for a bit due to a family event, which I was okay with. Another guy said he had a job interview coming up which conflicted with a meeting, and gave me his meeting contribution to me ahead of time, which I was also okay with - his graduation was coming up soon anyway.
2. Their work output is actually okay from the customers' perspective when it is about 4 or so months before they leave, though their work can be a bit slow according to the customers. I don't really mind, since I've mentored a strong strategy into the pre-juniors for how to update the customers on progress.",cscareerquestions,1636924482

But I can do engineering and finish on time (for community college) and transfer to a uni.

The university that I’m looking at has nearly the same classes between electrical and computer engineering with just a couple different classes that are more relevant for each program. But I didn’t really see any CS related classes.

I heard electrical engineers still have to code and can get developer jobs but I’m not too sure. And that computer engineering can’t go into depth with either CS or EE since it’s 50% of either studies. But some say it’s not worth doing EE so I really am stuck on deciding.

I’m a freshman so I’m not 100% sure about these things so bear with me please.

They proposed me a software engineering position in the company. Mind you, the company is not yet registered. 

Now as a senior set on graduating my mind is on the money.

[Not in US],"Hey all. I'll try to be as much transparent as I can. Got nothing to lose but my both mental and physical health.

&amp;#x200B;

As of September 2020, I graduated from a university in Turkey. Just before graduation I had an internship at a local software company and same company hired me. We didn't sign any contract. I literally talked with boss on WhatsApp and took the job. I was asked to ""promise"" not the leave the company for 2 years. Salary wasn't bad, at least it was higher than the minimum wage. For context 37 percent of workers gets minimum wage, highest percentage in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in company knows .NET Framework and WebForms. Back in internship I was asked to do a project in .NET Core and Blazor because boss wants to do a project with newer technologies. After I got hired I didn't have much to do. So I was outsourced to my boss' friend's company. I wasn't asked anything. I just had an e-mail saying that X is your new boss now. It started as a normal job. They were using .NET Core and newer tech stack but I started to more than my job description. At first I was only responsible for backend but in time it evolved and right now I'm (was) leading two teams, developing entire backend services on my own, doing system design for two upcoming projects, deployments to test and prod servers, code reviews, refactoring, setting up new projects... I mean, it can be done, I guess(???) I'm just a new grad and I don't think it's reasonable to ask this much of responsibility from a single person. Only thing I have is enthusiasm about Computer Science in general and awareness of some things' existence. I read technical books etc. Although I'm not proficient in anything I'm just aware of things to avoid or things to do. We were 6-7 people and they started the leave the company because everyone found a better paid job. Now there are 2 people left in the development team (me and a frontend dev) excluding CTO. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm pretty occupied with my main job. However I still have responsibilities at my original company. The project  the boss wants to do? I'm responsible for that project because everyone else is working with older technologies, many of the devs are outsource to handle legacy code. No one heard of API, microservices etc. For few months no one called but from time to time I'm asked to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

Another subject is overtime. None of my overtimes are compensated. But if I forgot to log my working hours in a day, I get threatened with a cut from my paycheck. If I log my overtime, no one cares.

&amp;#x200B;

There are countless things I can write here. How I got dismissed because I'm not senior enough etc. Thanks to Turkish economy every day my salary shrinks in USD. Back in March I had a $540 per month net salary. Now it's 450. In January I'll get a raise but it will not be higher than 550 dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to improve myself outside of work hours. Been grinding leetcode for the last few months but one of the FAANG rejected me last Friday. Other companies in EU/NA aren't even calling to interviews because of either covid or they don't offer visa sponsorship. Every time I get a rejection all they're saying to me that, I'm not bad but it's not enough.

I also don’t want to specialize in just Oracle or SAP that’s depressing. I would much rather help CREATE an app or a website and be challenged to learn and implement new technologies.

Here’s what I’ve figured out so far as far as my options:

1) self study something like a full stack web developer or even a single language such as Java and build out some projects and apply to entry level SE roles on my own HOWEVER there’s risk of stagnation and lack of motivation and structure doing it myself, I’m not a super disciplined person unless I know it’s the best course of action 

2) go to coding boot camp and take advantage of their employment services - there’s one near me that places grads regularly with good companies HOWEVER it’s tough to have a family and no income for 4 months unless, again, I know for a fact this is the best option and can convince the wife 

3) apply to a place like Revature which basically teaches you coding while paying you min wage and then shops you around to their clients where you work for them for peanuts for two years under contract

93,Should I keep my Data Science major?,"  

Hello! I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. I’m a college Jr, who is currently double majoring in history and data science. However, I’m considering dropping the data science major. I have had a few tech jobs outside of my coursework, and have some level of competence in web design, networking, troubleshooting/ computer maintenance, and I have a certification in cyber security. I’m hoping to go to law school/become a lawyer after college, potentially doing cyberlaw litigation or something similar. I don’t really see myself ever becoming a full-time data scientist. So, I’m considering dropping the major. I have a few reasons for doing so: 1. I really enjoy working with computers, but not particularly with data, I’m somewhat neutral on that front. 2. While my DS major is light on programming, I’ve never enjoyed nor done particularly well there. 3. As I’m going for law, I need to keep my GPA up, and DS will lead to more classes that I’d need to take, including some rather difficult ones. 4. My school has had difficulty retaining strong faculty in the department, and I’m more confident in the quality of my history education and even the experience with computers I have had outside of class. I don’t want to sound too negative about it though. I wonder if having the degree would set me apart, whether in law or just other jobs. Having data analysis as a “tool in my belt” has long been something that I wanted. I also wonder if having such a degree would be preferable on a resume, as history majors aren’t exactly known for their computer skills haha. I’m somewhat captivated by the potential of having the DS major.

So, here is what I really want to ask: How valuable will a DS BA (or potentially a minor instead) be for someone in my situation?",cscareerquestions,1636911240

99,When should i start to apply to a new job?,"To give some context, i work at a big company and make about 84k. My job helped pay for my masters which i finished this past May. Since they gave me some reimbursements i have to stay for up to a year in the company or id have to pay back everything the company paid in the past year. If i quit now for example id have to pay about 11k back to them. If i quit in february id have to pay back about 6k. According to the fine print id only have to pay back what they spent in the previous 12 months before i quit. Id have to quit around May of 2022 to not pay anything back. But just in case lets say June of 2022.

So to my question, im interested in getting a new job. I think i can get 6 figures if i apply to a new job. I tried applying to a higher position in the company months ago but i have yet to hear anything and my manager does not want me to take the new position cause it would take me to a different department within the company. He offered me to work on some new development stuff.  theyre creating in the company but at the same pay. This is my first job out of college, its a nice start but im interested in other things now. 

Im considering applying to many other companies, including FAANG and Tesla. I know the process is long in FAANG and Tesla companies assuming i make it far. When should i start applying to other companies if i have a potential dtart date of June 2022?

0,"Software engineers with experience under 2 years(neither entry or senior level), how long did it take for you to get a new job offer?","Hi! I am a software engineer with 1.5 years experience. 

After spending a year on my team, I have absorbed the most skills and knowledge for what we are doing, hence I think it’s time to change and learn new things. 

I started applying and interviewing positions that do exactly different things than what I do now in the current company around 3 mo ago and got pretty far with 2 companies. But they all eventually chose other candidates stating that those candidates are more familiar/experienced with the skills they are looking for which I know how to use it’s just I don’t have the industry experience at.

Here’s my question, with experience under 2 years, I am obviously not an entry level or a senior level. I actually felt it was easier to get job offer back then when I didn’t have any experience. At least people don’t have expectations for entry level to have experience in certain things.

Second, my personal opinion is that a good developer doesn’t mean he or she knows every single language or have experience in all of them. The important thing is that he or she is able to understand the concepts and learn it by themselves quickly. However, I feel like at least the few companies I was interviewing in the past 3 months believe that a candidate that did have industry experience with that language is still more suitable. 

Obviously, I don’t want to stuck doing what I am doing forever in my career, but if companies are so obsessed with experience in certain things, how can I get a job in a new field without having experience in that field?",cscareerquestions,1636905851

I’m getting by fine for now but come January I don’t know how long I can stay at Amazon.

Have been considering picking up CE/CS certificates and thus my ads all over my phone are for boot camps, certs, and back to school options.

After that, the person who was training us started a startup and i'm working there as a web developer (duh). Fast forward 2 months ago, i decided to go to a university to learn computer science but i really regret it because I suck at math and i already failed my first math exam and i can barely cover tuition because our economy has collapsed (forgot to mention i live in Lebanon) and our currency (LBP) has lost all its value, plus universities decided to increase tuition fees. The only reason i decided to go to uni was just so i can hopefully migrate to another country and you obviously can't do that without a degree. 
The reason i'm writing this here is because i'm thinking of dropping out because the things i will learn there don't interest me at all.

36,Senior Software Engineer of a different team keeps asking me for help on simple coding tasks,"For the context, there is this guy (let's call him John), 5-6 years of experience and a senior software engineer, and I am relatively junior, 2 years of experience, but because of my zeal for coding I know a lot of stuff as I have been coding for last 10-12 years. Anyway, I worked with John in a couple of projects and overall he is a since guy but completely stupid when it comes to programming. Throughout the timeframe of the project, he kept on asking me for my help on simple coding tasks or just debugging easy things like semicolon missing, for loops, array assignments, char sum with int etc. I know it sounds silly but it is true. I helped him a lot with his coding during the 2-3 months of projects timeline but since then I have switched projects.

Still, John keeps on pinging me that he needs help on such simple things. I have told him many times that he can simply Google the error messages because they are so common and the first result will definitely solve his problem. But instead of Googling, he will just pinging me or check my calendar and setup a meeting with me so that I can debug his code. There are a few days when I don't have any thing to do so I help him but sometimes it just annoys me completely. I would be working on my things and he would ping me saying he needs help and needs to submit this script ASAP. I tell him to Google it but he says please look at it as he can't Google it (what!?). I have told him many times that if I were in place I would Google it or just read a book on that language to clear my basics.

Also, when I am debugging his code on video calls, he would share his screen and ask me to read the code. I gets so fucking annoying to debug the code on video calls that I tell him to just send me the script and I will correct it in 2 mins but he never does because he thinks I will take away the credits. I mean, what credit will I take in correcting a for loop? It isn't that the company will give me a raise just because I debugged a simple for loop.

More so, recently he has started to ping me on weekends to solve his things. I have been ignoring his messages because its the weekends but then he calls or message me on WhatsApp. At this point, I am completely annoyed. I know I should help a fellow coworker but this guy is a senior engineer here and has been in this company for 3 years or so.

About myself, I had few year with college in ME, but I did not finish because I moved to US. Struggling with new life and schooling extented my collefe time with no possitive result.

I decided to get a CS degree in 4yrs university next year (so 2 more years). 
About codibg or programming stuffs, I started to learn coding and web dev by myself and got some basic knowledge to do some small and simple websites. However, I often lost motivation and felt lost. I really don't know what I want to do. It's just like I'm getting stuck in an infinite loop.

44,Advice for breaking into the industry?,"Hey everyone, 

this might sound a bit stupid, but I was looking for some advice on how to land an internship in my position.

I have a degree in Graphic Design and have over 4 years of experience, but ultimately decided to switch careers to SWE due to some SWE friends convincing me (I also asked them for some help already, but the companies they work at either didn't have openings or were hiring for more senior positions). Took on a boot camp around the first quarter of 2020, and graduated in March 2021. Ever since, I've just been learning other languages and frameworks, while also applying to a bunch of entry-level jobs and internships, while also working full-time still as a designer. Ended up getting laid off a couple of months ago with my design gig, which gave me more time to keep searching for a job in the tech field. I do enjoy design still and so in my head, the clearer path for me at the moment is to search for more front-end positions. I'm definitely comfortable with your basic html/css/scss/vanilla js, and am currently in the process of learning as much as I can about React.

Out of maybe... 90 applications, I landed 2 interviews for internships, passed the technical portions, but did not get the gig because someone else just had a little more knowledge and fit the position better. one of the companies I interviewed with even stated in the rejection email that it was pretty much the CEO who chose someone else, even though the entire team preferred me.

Aside from those two interviews, I haven't gotten any luck. I'm not getting ghosted or ignored.. and some companies actually state that it's because they prefer someone ""pursuing a cs degree"", which is fine. a company can do what they want. I went into this career change knowing that it would definitely be difficult to break into the industry, but I didn't imagine just landing interviews to be this difficult. So I just wanted to see if any senior devs or people with a lot of experience have any advice for a newbie like me.

I'll leave a link to my GitHub if it helps to point out any flaws ([github.com/mikeemorales](https://github.com/mikeemorales)).

47,CS and Game Development,"Hi everyone, I'm 23 years old, from FL, USA, still in college and currently considering switching to a CS degree from my current Digital Media (Game Design) major. 

TL;DR: I'm not here to ask you what i should do with my life, but i want to know from you and your experiences, those of you who studied CS and work with game development, how useful was your degree to you getting a job and entering the industry? 

To give a little more detail, i want to make videogames but I'm not sure i want to work making games for a big company. I want to work on my own projects, eventually (hopefully) open my own studio where I have the creative freedom to develop the projects that I want to work on. I'm currently on track for game design, but from the research I've done it seems that thia degree won't actually help me get a job with game development, or anywhere else. I'm also worried about and considering i may need to get a job outside of the gaming industry for some time until I'm able to live off my own studio, and I'm not totally sure i want to do design, which is why I've been pivoting towards Computer Science, where supposedly I would learn the basic skills necessary to code/program the projects i have in mind, while also be able to get a decent job elsewhere until i manage to work out my personal goals. 

 I also frequently see people making posts talking about how they're self taught, or just did a boot camp or whatever and now they make a ton of money. So is a degree in CS really necessary or is just studying and practicing code on my own actually enough? I would still like to probably get the degree anyways, but to repeat the question i asked above, how much do you think CS goes together with game development, and if you've had experience with this, was your degree useful to you learning skills necessary for getting the job you wanted?

Thank you in advance for any advice or insight you may have!

Also I'm pretty sure this is the right place for this post but if I'm in the wrong place i apologize, please point me in the right direction.",cscareerquestions,1636861604

64,Career change from desktop app developer to backend web dev and the unavoidable job gap.,"Brief about me (skippable info, no need to read): 

Nearly 3 years experience. Lost previous desktop developer job due to being set up for failiure and backstabbed coincidentally before 3 year mark for 401K matching. Can't find desktop developer job at all, job opportunities are slim, yet there are many web developer job postings. I forgot all I used to know about data structures and algorithms because I did not use them at all for multiple years, so a job gap is inevitable (already a few months in).  Sample of professional experience : Python, C#, C++ 

Questions (don't skip this section):

1) Will I never be able to get a job due to job gap required to specialize in web development (even if it is logically justifiable)? 

2) Can focusing on learning a single backend Framework in Python (other than that wich is universally used HTML,CSS,JS) allow me to apply for jobs or fallback on freelancing in case of failiure (enterprise and freelance viability is my criteria for a ""safe"" technology stack to learn) ?  If not, what tech stack is better?

3) Is Language/Framework-agnostic programming commonplace for backend developer jobs despite the job posting suggesting otherwise?

4) Should I remove previous job from my resume if it is not web dev experience but rather desktop dev.",cscareerquestions,1636851128
65,Questions related to majors and future career direction,"Hi guys, I am here to seek guidance on what would be the best move when it comes to pursuing a college education and career direction if I want to be in the tech field. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm about to finish my AA in Psychology, and it's time for me to transfer to a university. So these are my choices: 

 ♦  Go to UW and study business administration with a concentration on management information systems and graduate with a UW degree while working hard to keep my grades up. And then apply for a CS master's degree at UW. 

 ♦  Go to a good state school to do management information system, and then do CS master there or try applying to UW. 

 ♦  Change major at CC to computer science and then transfer to UW CS major or the state school. I know the Seattle campus is really competitive, so I could just try with Bothell or Tacoma. Another thing is, I'm not brilliant at math, but I'll definitely try my best to get good grades in classes. One downside of this is that it may take me longer to graduate. 

♦ Just keep coding and get good at JS, and see if I can get a job at some small company around here to just have some work experience. (Already self-learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and currently studying the intermediate level of JS.) Then later I can still go back to school for a CS degree. 

♦ Attend coding Bootcamp, although I'm not too sure about that since I don't know if there are good ones around here. Plus, it might be too expensive and not worth the cost anyways. 

When it comes to grades, I got 4.0 in every class I took so far. And I know to be in this field you need to constantly learn and be in front of the computer all day, I am absolutely fine with that. 

My ultimate goal is to basically work as a software engineer at a company that has branches in Europe and then see if I can work in one of those branches. Or I guess I can just apply to Scandinavian tech companies and see how that goes later on. And I definitely would love to learn the language in that country. 

Please give me some guidance on which choice is better, and show me if there are other directions I could take that I did not even think of. Or share your stories with us so that we can all learn something from your stories.

66,I started my first job last month but my Salary is tied to my Visa status.,"Hi, I started my first Job as a developer last month with a salary of 64k / yr. For some context, I am an international student, graduated with a Master's in May, got a referral at the company for an internship 4 months ago. Internship was at a meager 1000/ month. And last month they offered me FTE at 64k. 

I was told that anyone who is employed during their OPT period (a visa status) would have a fixed designation and salary. HR told me that Salary and title renegotiations would occur once my Visa status changes to H1B. 

My main concern here is that regardless of my performance, my salary would be fixed for an unknown amount of time. Since H1b is a lottery based system, there is no guarantee that my application would be picked this year / next year / the year after that. And this would mean that I'd be on the same salary w no bonus and I'd have no say over it. 

That being said, this is my first job, I was barely getting any interviews so I am grateful for the opportunity. And the current salary more than meets my living expenses. Tbh I was able to manage at a 1000/mo salary albeit living frugally.

The draw-backs are that if I quit or don't accept a contract I have to pay them $10k, and I have to relocate since the job is completely in-person. I also noticed some negative reviews and claims they prey on people who need sponsorship for a VISA (I'm from the U.S. so that doesn't apply to me).

74,Serial procrastination leading to all nighters and health issues,"As a 27 year old I have, out of completely nowhere, developed an incredibly detrimental procrastination habit. I have had a remote job with a flexible schedule and a forgiving boss for over a year now. I can take time off pretty abruptly and even when I'm expected to work a certain amount of hours, it's by month and not week (so I can work 30 one week and 50 the next week instead of ""clocking in"" for example). The downside is I'm not paid as well as I could elsewhere, but I value the flexibility quite a lot, and the pay is still good. 

In the past 3-4 months, for whatever reason, I have been unable to even look at the work without getting exhausted. The idea of it turns me into a slug, mentally and physically, and I end up doing like 12 hours of work monday through friday. This leads to intense catch up on the weekend. Even up until Sunday afternoon, I may have like 30 hours of work to do and talk about in our meetings. This leads to staying up all night on Sunday to do some 17 hours of work, and then I just tell them I worked the 30 over the weekend. Then I try to make up the rest the next week. 

In the past month, I have been stopping the all nighters because it's fucking me up in a lot of ways and probably making me less focused too. I was starting to have issues digesting food well and that was the end of the all nighters for me. 

It's not just that I'm playing video games or doing something fun. It's that  would rather do anything other than start work. Any question on my mind drops work completely and needs to be researched. I would rather read shower curtain reviews than work. Even in a distraction free environment, it is very easy for me to procrastinate. This is really strange to me, because I wouldn't say the work has gotten less fulfilling. But my gut feeling is I'm so afraid of doing a bad job or being seen as a subpar programmer that I don't want to even start the work. This is a trait I have always associated with people either in bad work environments where they are punished for non-perfect solutions, or new programmers who never really learned its okay to fail (and programming often means tiny failures adding up to successes). 

This isn't really anything my boss is doing. He's really forgiving and wants to teach me things. And I have always liked breaking things in programming and learning how it all works, and I'm not afraid of errors or recognizing the code I wrote wasn't the best way to write it. So I am not sure why I suddenly feel this way. I suspect it's because I feel like I should be better at this by now, or the kind of work I'm doing has more ambiguous goals. Or that I have the idea of a promotion in mind and I'm worried I'll fail to get it. Maybe I just know I can get away with it subconsciously (although it makes me feel like a useless piece of shit and I miss learning things). I really don't know, but I clearly have had a big mental shift in how I view work and it's keeping me from wanting to even get started. 

It's also possible I am having bigger issues. I am not depressed in anyway, but I definitely used to be a person who would shoot out of bed as soon as I woke up, excited to read about something or play something. Now I linger in bed for at least an hour before I can even imagine getting up. I am wondering how this changed so suddenly (even when I had depression, I was a pretty proactive person, and I'm a lot better now). I used to work out more, and that could be another cause. 

Has anyone ever had sudden shifts in attitude like this? Is it just a part of getting older? Or is it a symptom of something deeper? I just want to be productive again.",cscareerquestions,1636845544

I have an issue that I’ve been trying to get around for some time now: I don’t know if I have imposter syndrome or if I am genuinely lacking some skills. 

I’ve been in development for about 16 years now. I’ve held many positions and worked my way up well. I’ve shipped lots of software and generally do it quite well… once I get my head in the game. 

The problem I have is visualising software as a whole. I sometimes find myself duplicating my own code in other areas because I’d forgotten i had already written it. I spend AGES thinking and over thinking and second guessing my design decisions. 

I also struggle with the basics of design patterns and principles. When I’m learning them I’m fine then when I use them in practice I spend ages wondering if it should have an interface or be in the infrastructure layer. 

I love programming, I’ve wanted to do it since I was 13. My college didn’t really do a course that interested me as they were so far behind. They were teaching me things I’d learned 3 years before. Not that I was so far ahead but the basics I knew. 

I decided to go off and learn it myself. The problem is that I think I’ve missed some fundamentals which allow ideas and principles to stick in my mind. 

When I come to planning a project out, I spend a crazy amount of time writing code then instantly refactoring. 

Like I say, I’ve delivered a lot and I’m happy with what I deliver in the end, it just takes me ages to get  there sometimes. 

I spend a lot of time developing by myself and can’t bounce ideas off people, I sometimes wonder if it’s that. 

Please can someone give me advice to whatever this is I am experiencing and potentials on how to fix it. I want to stop second guessing myself. 

I’m a contractor about to be paid out for a big project and I can afford to take a few months getting this on track as I just want to be passionate about programming again.

77,G vs Audible | I hate you G," 

Hi everyone,

First of all, thanks to this community for everything especially helping me create a better resume!

I  have seen all sorts of comparison between companies and wanted to know  about Audible vs G (think it might also help someone in the  future). I guess everyone here would prefer G over Audible. If I  had offers from Audible and G, I would pick G too. It was my  dream company for a long time. It probably still is, I don't know. I  prepared like crazy, reached out to about 20-30 recruiters and about 50  alumni on LinkedIn, to get an interview from G; but no luck.

I  joined Audible recently and received an OA from G. Guess what! I  am not even that excited about it. It took me 5 months after graduating  to land the job that I have now and don't want to go through the  interview process unless it's really worth going for. I know it's just  an OA but just curious about the pros and cons about picking one company  over another in the long run (assuming if someone has to make a  decision)

I would appreciate if experienced people in this field can share your thoughts on this.

What I love at Audible as an SDE-1

1. WLB  

   1. My teammates said that this team has one of the best WLB
   2. Even on-call is not that stressful
2. Compensation and Benefits  

   1. About 130 base
   2. 26 RSU
   3. $500/month rent reimbursement
   4. Hybrid work model  

      1. No minimum number of days to work from office
      2. I feel like this is one of the biggest pros
   5. I don't think sign-on bonus or relocation matters too much in the long run
3. Industry  

   1. I like entertainment-related industries
4. 10% employee discount on Amazon

Possible cons at G

1. I might give-up WLB. Many reviews on glassdoor say that WLB is not that great
2. Having to go to office
3. Nearly the same compensation
4. No rent reimbursement
5. only 5% employee discount on G

I feel like there's not too much room for innovation at Audible. Isn't this the biggest cons of picking Audible over G?",cscareerquestions,1636844567

88,New work / previous pay stubs discrepancy,"I'm in the final round with a company (not a FAANG or anything but the comp is good and I really like them) and it's going well.

I had a shorter contract stint prior to this - 2 months or so. I didn't drop a prod db or anything and we parted on good terms, the company was doing a kind of re-org and a few people got the axe. In retrospect it was a bone-headed move not to include it on a resume but my logic was that I didn't want to have to explain over and over what happened there because it was such a short tenure.

Anyway, I just remembered that last time I landed a salaried position the background check included either a W2 or pay stubs - I don't quite remember which it was. I suppose they'd want to verify that I worked where I say I did. However, since there was a shorter contract at the end of the gig previous to that, I wonder if anyone in the know could comment on what that time discrepancy would look like in a background check.

I passed all the assessments with flying colors and the company is into it. I was submitted via a third party agency and the rate's been agreed upon. Is it standard practice for new employers to even require pay stubs or proof of previous employment? (and again, it's not like I didn't work where I said I did... just not quite as long)

How do they get validated, anyway? I'd rather not have any of previous agencies be contacted as they occasionally get pissy that I'm not looking for work through them.

Should have avoided all this but it is what it is. Curious to hear thoughts re: pay stubs / previous employment.",cscareerquestions,1636839543

I have been searching for a job for 3 months. I recently graduated with a 3.5, but have no internships. My resume has some good projects and is well formatted.

With the interviews I do get, I would wait 2 weeks just for them to not move forward with my application. I've probably applied to 400-500 jobs.

All the business classes I already finished like marketing, accounting, finance, management, etc. The soon to be technical classes I will take are python, database management systems, SQL, system analysis, data warehousing, ETL, data analytics, business intelligence, project management, and an internship.

93,I just got my landed my first Software Developer job post-college! How do I plan out my career from here?,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions, 

I'm a Nigerian and recent computer science graduate. 

After sending out over a hundred applications, receiving dozens of rejections I'd finally got three offers and took up the offer from the company whose offer I liked the most.

I'll be working as a Back-End Developer on one or more SaaS products, my coding assessment was completed in Python/Django (I chose that) but I was informed that I will actually be writing in Java day-to-day. 

This is more than fine with me. 

I want to seek advice on how to prepare myself to get a good job outside of my country. I'm currently about to be enrolled in the country's Youth Service programme which is a year long and mandatory for all University graduates if you wish to work in the country. So ideally I'd want to use this year to gain work experience at the current company I was just hired at (starting on the 22nd), gain the necessary skills/knowledge required to be worth the trouble of employing by a foreign company and complete my youth service. 

 I wanted to ask to anybody here what sort of companies/resources I should be looking at to get myself hired abroad with a year plus to plan?

Is java as a back-end development language popular enough to land me a job abroad (Ideally Europe or Canada)? Do I need to ideally work on my front-end skills to be employable? 

What technologies/skills should I focus on learning outside my job that I'm about to start?

I'd **really** appreciate any advice people would be willing to give, I've attached an anonymized version of my CV below if it will help give any useful context and I'd be willing to answer any questions.

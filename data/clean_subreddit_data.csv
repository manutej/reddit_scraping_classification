possible implications in returning to work in the US after pursuing a cs degree in EU,"I've held off my cs studies for most of covid and now have the option to either resume studies in US or go to EU and get a degree there. I've been looking into what effects this could have and whether it'd hinder my job prospects after returning to the states even if I'm a citizen, or if its to any other possible effect. Any thoughts on what implications there might be other than visa related ones for eu? thanks",1,1637254205,80,415
VR Career Advice,"My background is in designing and programming AV systems. I've loved the work and the process of learning more, but the pandemic has changed me. I used to see myself helping people to have great meeting experiences with AV systems, but now the only meeting experience that I want to improve is the VR meeting experience. I see how it's going to change everything, and I want in!

I have ten years of experience designing AV systems as a consultant. I've had a good run of it. I also spent a lot of time building our company's Revit (3D/BIM) capabilities and programming some substantial projects in backwater AV languages - Lua would be the most widely known language. The programming work is roughly equivalent to full-stack development - lots of work getting owner buy-off on UCIs. The backend work is usually light scripting to command devices with simple protocols/APIs.

Before that, I took various CS coursework, so I took data structures, operating systems, databases, discreet math with exposure to C++, Java, SQL, PHP, and Python. As a kid, I was really into building websites: I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Photoshop for fun. I really like programming, and I'm good at it. Our company doesn't pitch ourselves first and foremost as a programming company, so the work we get isn't steady, and it's often cursed to function as a side gig. Performing difficult programming work while being shot at by architects for your 'day job' is a drag.

Quest introduced me to VR. I could never justify getting a powerful VR PC (2 kids take up all my free time outside work). However, I've decided that I can justify owning a powerful VR PC as long as I use it for mining when I'm not on it. It's working out wonderfully.

Now I'm ready to find my next career move. I'm toying with the idea of finishing up a master's program. My background is a BA in music, so my academic credentials are very meh. However, I thought more deeply: the masters would cost me \~$25k, three years, 15 hours per week. That is a shit load of effort and money for a generalized degree. I'm 38, so I feel the clock ticking. As much as I would like to prove that I can pass through the ring of fire, i.e., an algorithms course, I might do better just taking that class as a one-off and spending the rest of my time and money learning Unity, Unreal, C, Maya, Blender, 3dsmax.

My life's work has always been at the intersection of non-trivial technology and non-technical people. My wonderful Luddite wife keeps me grounded in this respect too. Maybe I don't need to aim to become a serious VR dev - maybe there's something available with less retraining necessary. Any insights are greatly appreciated!!",1,1637253634,468,2681

I Did It. I Finally Found A Dream Position. No Internship Experience And Mid-30's Something Guy. Thank you for the help everyone!,"I feel this type of obligatory post for this subreddit, so here it is. A bit about myself, I returned to school for computer science in my 30's. I came from a healthcare background where I worked in the realm of physical therapy. I started school in 2018 and finished in 2021. Due to some circumstances, I could not get any internship experience, and I knew this was going to hinder me. 

The process was tedious. There were 400 or so job applications. 200 LC questions, which I actually enjoyed and will continue to do them.  I worked on three different side projects. I received plenty bunch of ""We love your personality/enthusiasm, but we need someone with more experience.""  I eventually reached a point of stopping caring, or I was numb to the generic email rejection. When I achieved that mindset, things were much more freeing.

In the last few weeks, I casually entertained the hiring process with different companies and attended career fairs. In one career fair, I had some was quick banter with someone, and I was invited for an interview a few days later.  After that, I offered me an SRE position. I conditionally accepted it. They said it's fully remote, FT, full benefits, and unlimited PTO. There is room for me to move laterally and vertically. 

They asked about my salary range, and I said I'd need to get back to them since I didn't research this topic much. After some research and discussion with other people in the field, I concluded on $80000 - $85000. They agreed.

A couple of days later, I got another call from a company that I interviewed with, and they offered me a $100000 full-stack role, but they have a hybrid working model. I asked them to give me a few days to decide. 

With the help of this subreddit,  with the notion, ""It is okay to ask for more money. "" I decided that I would ask for a small salary bump from the original company. I asked them for $92500, to which they agreed.

Yes, I know this isn't FANG money, but I don't care. The position is entirely remote, with good benefits and good PTO. Furthermore, with no internship experience, I'd be a bloody fool to say no.

The silly thing about this whole interview process for this company. . .I wasn't asked a single LC question.",1,1637252872,400,2226
6 months into my first dev job and alarms are blaring,"Bootcamp grad here 6 months into my first role as a full stack developer and things are... not great. Dev team here consists of me, the ceo, and a team of 5 offshore devs. When I first started up I immediately noticed a lot of architectural decisions that made me scratch my head and wonder why things were being done this way. I asked questions and got to know the product and now 6 months later I'm really worried. What I at first thought was my own inexperience with enterprise level programming and this language (I had learned for a month up to starting the role) has been revealed to actually be a horrendously architected platform. Basic tenets of oop aren't being followed, almost no accepted language conventions are being followed, and we use this weird combo of mvc/ mvvm. It's a mess. What should be a straightforward CRUD part of the app has multiple methods called ""edit"", with one of them actually acting as the update method. We have one god model that every other part of our project is based on. All of this was giving me significant pause, but what really put the nail in the coffin was when we hired an actual experienced dev. He is consistently blown away by the incompetency with which this project was architected. He gets very heated and actually ends up shouting at our CEO, who wrote a lot of the code himself. He's barely been here a couple of months, but I can tell he's already at his breaking point. I don't know what to do as this is my first job. I wanted to try and learn everything I can from the new experienced guy, but I don't see him staying here much longer. In fact I worry about the longevity of the company itself.

Variation on common career path Q,"Hello all - lot's of details so I will attempt to distill, but may fail.  Just looking for opinions from folks in the field - will be cross posting for max exposure so apologies for any redundancy.

I'm 33, been on my own since 16 and have been working poor my whole life.  I'm married - no kids yet but would like to be able to within 5 years.   Have mostly worked labor/service jobs, some ""higher level"" customer service, but now due to 3 months and counting of debilitating long haul virus symptoms I have no choice but to start making moves to stay afloat, although I've already felt this way for years.  These are important details to mention to describe the sense of urgency on my part.  

Been to college twice and had to drop both times for work.  Enjoyed it a lot and did fairly well so I always wanted to go back, but I am loan shy for obvious reasons.  I'm not sure how many (if any) of those credits will transfer but I'm looking into it.  I now have a potentially once in a lifetime opportunity to get state funding for a degree (still need to determine eligibility for the program), and I can't afford to f- this up if it pans out. 

Out of all the programs I've narrowed it to 3 - a one year accelerated general associate's (with intentions to transfer to a four year degree), two year software development associate's degree through a highly respected tech school (with the same intentions), and a four year bachelor's in human services from an established state university.  The program is limited to what degrees it will pay for, and these are the best options I could find.  So here's the rub:

I've always avoided tech fields due to the fact that math hasn't ever come naturally to me.  That's not to say I can't do it - it may just take more time and effort but once I get it I really *get it.*  Digging into the computer science realm, the more I see the more exciting it looks; it would be a challenge but also something interesting/fun for once, and a much more potentially lucrative and marketable skill than I've ever had before.  I'm still not sure which direction within the field would be the best fit for me.

The life I've lived has given me natural skills that would be highly translatable to a human services field like social work/counseling, along with a bit of a bleeding heart.  I did entry level volunteer work for two years which burned me out entirely (am still learning skills to deal with that more effectively though), and was disenchanted with the bureaucracy, unethical practices and straight up fraud within that realm (I'm fully aware of its pervasiveness throughout all industries - facts of life, but it's particularly bad when the direct ""in your face"" cost is human lives and increased suffering).  I would still rather have a career like that to fall back on than say, dishwashing/cooking at a restaurant, customer service etc. (no offense to service jobs, I'm just over it).

The fact is I would like to pursue both disciplines *if possible* to minimize my chances of ever needing to flip another burger or stock another shelf.  That is the goal.  I see a lot of potential in either case and am not really asking about which is better.  There are pro's and con's to both and I have considered many, such as outsourcing/saturation, automation, burn out potential, recession survival etc.  I also see that the world changes so fast nowadays so time is of the essence, and I don't have any safety net to speak of if things go sideways.  I still haven't found a crystal ball, but I've watched the tides' steady rise for decades and need the best boat I can get.  

**Does it matter to people hiring in the CS industry what my bachelor's degree is actually in, so long as I have one and am able to do the work?**  I've seen a lot of success stories from self taught programmers, and thought if I could teach myself during school along with doing my best to take extra math classes or (minor in CS if the program allows), join programming clubs and do projects at school/on my own, The Odin Project and the like - would it matter that it was not an actual CS degree?  I've also seen people say that not having at least a 4 year degree has been a direct hindrance in being considered for many positions.  *I wouldn't consider the human services degree if it wasn't free*, but it would be nice to have for career mobility.  I also realize that it may be problematic for me to pursue a master's in CS if that was something I wanted to do later on.  

The associates or tech degree would be a good pathway to a bachelor's in CS but it's hard to pass up a free $45k degree.  I realize it would be preferable for me to just ""pick one"" but as I said, this isn't really that cut and dry IMO.  I can't afford to f- up but I also can't afford to waste years of my life, since even if I do get the free degree I would possibly need to supplement income with loans *and* work at least part time.  I realize it would be difficult to effectively teach myself computer science while doing all that, but the objective would be to throw myself into it with the vigor of a drowning man.  

Apologies for the wall of text - I appreciate any guidance.

"Getting calls for Senior roles , but I am still a junior ( or at least skills wise ), want to transition to another junior role in another company.","Need some help here , I am a long time lurker on this sub and I am using a throwaway account to post this. 

I am currently looking for a new job. I have working in my current job for about 10 months as a Software engineer. This is my first job where I am working on design and development of the software. I took this job , because I needed the job during the pandemic, and my thought was ' at-least it will pay my bills for now '. 

Before this I was working in technical support for 2 years. 

Whenever I apply for a job , I get interview calls , but the problem is , I am only getting interview calls for mid senior roles now. Recruiters / HR consider my 2 years of tech support as a work experience and push me for mid senior roles.

The problem here is that in 2 years of my tech support I have learned nothing , have not even written one line of code. It was more like fixing network issues for enterprise customers ( and that too , it was mostly related to old switches and routers ( contract TAC engineer ) ) .

Recently, I went to an interview and this guy just ripped me apart. I had no idea about how RabbitMQ works , no idea about how AWS VPC is to be configured , had to idea how to design system and all. This has happened multiple times and I feel that , interviewer tend to focus less on LC and more on design + development as you move senior in role. ( might be wrong here ) . 

I don't think I am yet qualified for a job that needs me to design system and all. I need a more junior level jobs , where I get to design small feature, handle tests , fix bugs ( you know the kind of things a person with 10 months of experience does ) 

Should I remove that 2 years of experience from my resume ? Will I still get interview calls for a more junior role ? I am not sure what to do , if I keep that I get senior role jobs , if I remove that , I would probably not get an interview call ? 

Or , shall I just , keep applying + preparing for mid level jobs in the meantime. I am thinking it will take me about 6 months of preparation to get basics right about AWS + system design etc.

Instead of accepting that this, they seems to direct there anger/disapproval towards me and other team members. The company works in a highly regulared environment and the IT teams have strick rules. As a dev there is little I can do to influence the wider company, and belive me I gave tried.

For example: Directors come to me with their idea, I explain what would need to be in place and get to work reaching out across the company to try and get things in place. I hit road block after roadblock. These blockers are often other directors saying no you can't have that tool, or you can't have access to that data. 

I return to the directors asking for new dev work and explain the blockers. But they are not interested in dealing with assisting with the blockers, or talkimg to tge other directors, instead demanding that I get it done, or end up being extremely condescending. ""Do you think it's acceptable that this has taken so long?""

"How to deal with ""laid back"" culture?","I recently joined a company that is doing quite well. I am quite high in terms of organigram but not in terms of command. But the process of the company is not good at all for 500+ engineers. The teams are horizontally divided so, there is constant ball passing, finger pointing which affects deadlines, work, etc. Stakeholders are so busy that they dont have 15 mins to discuss improvements nor do they seem interested. Their approach is most like ""dont fix it if aint broke"". Since they have capital (which is not unlimited) they are laid back and just throws money at problems in terms of hires, delays, downtimes, etc. IMO, this is not going scale as the company grows.

1. I could negotiate with company A and B to shorten their start and end dates so that once I finish company A, I transition to company B
2. I could break company A's signed offer and go with company B
3. Stay with company A, then reapply or hit up Company B again to expedite the interview process for whenever I finish company A's internship duration

May 2021 Grad trying to find way back,"Hi everyone! Not really sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really wanted advice on how to move forward with my life in terms of my career. (First few paragraphs are about me and a little more insight to why I was feeling the way I'm feeling so feel free to skip to the last paragraph to see my questions)

So just some background for myself, I graduated in May 2021 with a degree in CS but COVID hit me really hard mentally. Several of my closest family members died and it really hit me hard. It really doesn't help that I'm one of those people that coasted through school and never went out of my way to try things out. (Yes this means I never went out of my way to look for internships) Yeah I made some projects just for fun, but it's just simple projects. For example, some projects made by just using Java's Swing GUI. I never once learned on what React, Docker or whatever these employers are looking for. I only really knew how to code in Python, Java, and a little of C. 

Once I graduated, I did apply to about 20 places (Yeah, rookie numbers I know..) and have around 3 places actually calling me back. I was really fresh to how interviewing work so I passed the initial phone screening for all of them pretty much. I was moreso surprised about all the technical interviews that followed. Like I said before, I only really knew core concepts and probably the basics of coding in Python, Java and C. I even had a technical interview that I bombed and I'm pretty sure it was pretty easy as they only asked how to work with exceptions and what static was in Java (Stuff that I didn't do in my last year so I completely forgot). Then I found about this subreddit and I see people that have been Leetcoding (Would you guys believe that I never knew about Leetcode before coming here?) for months and here I am thinking that I can find a job with the basics. 

So with all that paired up with what happened to my immediate family, I just took a break for a couple months. Weak I know, but I really needed this break as how hard COVID hit my family and the realization of how different the industry is from school really made me mental quite close to breaking.

So now we come to November, where I am feeling a lot better so I'm finally back to applying. I've started looking into Leetcode and embarassingly it takes me around 30 minutes to solve one Easy problem. I'm trying to review questions that I bombed that one time (how exceptions work and what static is). Obviously a 6 month break really rusts up my coding skill (Not like I had anything impressive) but I feel like I'm getting back to the gist about it. I'm also going to eventually start to try and develop my own website if that's within my skillset.

So here are my questions. Did I screw up by taking the 6 month break I did? Not like I regret it since I feel a lot better but will employers be asking what I did? Also, like I said before, I only really know how to do trivial code in Python, Java, and a little bit of C. Yeah, I completed some projects with them, but nothing too amazing. Probably the best thing I made was a mobile app on Android Studio with Java. But other than that, I feel like I know nothing. Even simple data structures and algorithm questions, I completely forgot but I have been reviewing them little by little.",1,1637223851,629,3324
Should I quit now to switch to this completely remote opportunity?,"I graduated earlier this year. And upon graduation, I was so scared of being unemployed I applied everywhere. After months of job searching, when I finally got an out-of-state offer at company A, I just straight up accepted it. Good thing is, company A has been super chill. I feel like I have ownership of my projects and the deadlines are flexible. However, by the spring of next year, company A will want to move me out of state to where the company is located and I don't want to move there because my significant other is still working in my hometown. I really only just took that offer at company A because I wanted a job at that time, even when I do enjoy the work now.

Now, I am presented with another opportunity. This opportunity pays around 5K more and is permanently remote. However, the company does seem interesting... It has almost 1000 employees but only 3 data scientists supporting the entire company, and they are seeking the 4th... which I am a candidate of. They described themselves as desperately seeking an additional resource and have been searching for it ""quite a while"". It also has a 5-decade long company history and went through multiple rebranding of its company name. I am really tempted by the permanently remote opportunity but am afraid of quitting my current job.

Should I take a leap forward and quit my current job (even though it's still months away from spring of next year when they want to move me) or take my chances and wait for other remote opportunities until they are to move me?",1,1637222844,271,1529
Underpaid and working 11+ hours a day without OT,"Hi I am quite new in CS, I have worked for over a year as developer without CS degree but economics and I think I fit well. I work for international IT company with over 2000 employees just in my country.

When I applied to a job, corona was hitting the job market and there was no question about salary since I just graduated and needed a job. So I took 'as less as possible'. 

After three months I have checked similar positions even in my company and they offered 50 % more for my position. When I check now, they offer 70 % more than my initial pay. 

I am not very dependent on pay, but I am on bed managed project and they don't want to pay OT even we work long hours and are saying there are no money selected for OT so we should do all work in 8 hours even though it's not possible. 

I had a talk with my career cancelour about salary, but he said he can offer only 20% raise to my initial pay max due to internal rules.

Have Let Skills Languish... What do I do?,"So I graduated a 3 year program 10ish years ago. I got an easy job where I didn't learn much. I went freelance, for the freedom, and other than one project I fell back on easy shit a monkey could do. Hey, it paid the bills and I could have beers and play video games on a Tuesday afternoon.

I eventually got a full time position, things were looking up, but I was just too rusty/overwhelmed by a complex system and there was almost zero support. My contractual term completed and that was that. I didn't get permanent, but they didn't have any real issues with my work quality or output. We left on fine terms.

Pandemic hit and I did some more freelance, just subsistence level basic stuff. Didn't improve, didn't do much. Didn't care to.

I'm not really sad or depressed. I'm usually either in good spirits or neutral. I just don't feel motivated or very interested in anything. 

So here I am. I know I can DO things but I just feel so worthless in a job market where I should be super advanced at something, anything, but I'm not.

Any ideas what steps I could take to get my career into recovery? It really does feel hopeless sometimes looking at job postings mentioning shit I haven't used for several versions or shit I have never touched. Why even bother applying?

Is Operation Engineering Internship worth it?,"Well, I'm interviewing with a TECH company (finally, and again). The process is going pretty smooth, and I am expecting to be offered an internship. However I'm not sure if it's worth taking. Help me think this through.

1. I am on STEM OPT which expires Jun 2023. The prospective employer said they can apply for my H1b next year if all goes well. My current employer is trying to figure out if they can provide me with H1b (they're cap-exempt).
2. I want to become a Robotics/SW Engineer soon. Then graduate to SWE or something in FAANG. This position is just traveling the states and setting up robots. My motivation here: I have to start somewhere.
3. My current TC is \~$50k with all possible benefits (even legal!). From what glassdoor says prospective company pays $21-29/hr to interns + overtime. Idk about benefits yet. I can just assume that I will make more at the prospective company.
4. At my current job I work about 5-10 hrs/week. Prospective employer's recruiter promised 40-60 hr weeks. I don't mind that, especially since 40-50% of it is travel. Might actually save up for a MS.
5. I am in the Bay Area, and I so far I couldn't break into tech (graduated May 2020). Last year I burned out after 600 applications, 10-12 phone screens, 6 first rounds, 3 second rounds, 1 onsite and being ghosted afterwards (I would like to call out Quizzlet for this bullshit). Also had an offer which I wouldn't consider in my worst nightmares. This year I just started applying, but my callback rate isn't good at all. This job actually might be my chance.
6. Am I going to lose my foundation in non-ML machine vision I've built up in the past two years if I switch over to this position?
7. My current employer isn't kicking me to the curb any time soon, but I know that I have to move on at some point (kind of a dead end career-wise). Internship is 3 months, with a potential 9 month extension, and then conversion to FT. Recruiter promised high conversion rate.

Career Switch from Oil &amp; Gas Industry to Dev.," 

Hi All,

I have about 6 years of combined experience in the Process Automation industry Specifically in the Oil &amp; Gas sector, and currently 30 years old.  
As I work on legacy systems, my exposure has been limited to VB6, VB.net, SQL/Mongo and for now Python but not as a full-fledged Software Developer. I do build internal solutions but have never done something massively used such as e-commerce/web apps etc. 

I intend to shift to the Software Development sector, and currently investing about 6 hours a day apart from my 12-hour work schedule to learn, prepare and create projects around standard tech stacks as well as re-learning DSA in deep on weekends.   
However, in my personal opinion, and the overall feedback that I got from my company as well as when asked by different developers, I am good at Backend development. but pretty much no experience in the Web front end, unlike desktop applications.  


**My 2 major questions are -:** 

**1)** I just wanted to know if it is possible to transition from Oil n Gas sector to IT Sector at this age? or it is too late for such a career switch? The reason for such transition is the saturation in my field and the work has become monotonous, and feel no better ways to transition to good work.

  
**2)** What should be the focus of the area if my interest is towards backend engineering specifically APIs and Microservices?

Thank you for your time.",1,1637212087,249,1416

Should I be taking a risk on my last internship?,"Hey all, I'm a CS masters student and I recently received 2 summer internship offers. They're pretty different from each other and I'd appreciate any advice on which one to take. This will be my last internship before graduating.

Offers:  
1. SWE intern for a startup in NYC. They've grown a lot in the past couple years.  
2. Data Science intern for an older tech company in the Bay area.

Career-wise I'd like to work more in data science/ML engineering. I've done a couple internships in data science. I don't experience in SWE (besides taking a class in it next semester and basic software development), but I'm interested in exploring it before I graduate. However, I'm worried that if I do SWE next summer and then look for data science/ML jobs in the fall it'll look bad or be a step back career-wise.

On the other hand, the tech company has name-brand recognition, but I didn't do any technical interviews for the position. The team I'd work for is really small, and I got the impression that they don't have many well defined projects. However, I'd be doing stuff that's more aligned with what I'd like to work in after graduating.

"I got an odd email about a job placement program from an IT bootcamp, and I'm confused.","The email title is this...

Morally conflicted about working for big tech,"I’m a senior in college studying CSE. I’m about to start applying for jobs and ever since I was a freshman I dreamed of working for a FAANG company. I had many different reasons, I wanted to work alongside the smartest devs, use new tech, work on most challenging problems, learn from the most experienced people, and make lots of money. 

The problem is that over the last 5 years I have begun to absolutely detest companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. I don’t agree with their business practices and I hate the negative consequences of their products. They quite literally run the world, and have massive implications for the economy, for politics, for culture, etc. I hate Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, and the other people like them who lead these companies. I could go on and on, but the point is I don’t think I could ever work for them without feeling like I’m a hypocrite, but it sure seems like the best way to get all of the things I listed above is to do just that. 

I want to work for a company that gives me all of those things, but has REAL human beings leading them. As cliche as it sounds, I want to work for a company that wants to make the world a better place and wants to move humanity forward, not just generate profit. Is this hopeless to wish for?

Is it hard to become SWE after SRE Co-Op?,"Quick background, I took Computer Engineering in College, worked at some jobs (mostly support and finally  Cloud Admin) but went back to school for Software Engineering after I took a layoff at my most recent job.

Fast forward this year, I've decided to do co-op.  Didn't get very lucky with Software Developer interviews (I even had one for Amazon) but got an offer for an SRE role at a highly reputable company. It is fully remote which is also pretty cool.

Originally it was 4-month term, but I asked if it was possible to extend when the term ends since I wouldn't be able to complete my final term until 12 months later anyways (this is due to the way the courses are available and becaue I only have one semester remaining.

I do love to code, and took this on due to the automation aspects of the job.    However, I believe I would mainly like to code, if I get an exciting development role.  My question is, how difficult would it be to move onto a development role after finishing the co-op term and graduating?  

I am sort of safe because the term would end and I would return to school for a semster, but I also realize I won't have opportunity to do other co-op work during the 12 months.  In case a software development co-op opportunity came.  But I also know, I may have better chances at taking on a full-time development role at the same company if I do kickass work, but not sure about other companies.

"Just got out of my second cubital tunnel surgery, don't be me (9 YOE)","**TL/DR:** If you start losing feeling in your arms, that's downstream of being a programmer and inflaming your forearms holding your hands in a cocked position.  Which then compresses the nerves etc etc etc.  And then you don't do anything about it for a year and a half and then you get to have a surgeon move some nerves around.  Woops!

So do something about it ***yesterday***.  

**Longer version:**

In 2019, I started losing feeling in my hands and suffering severe and ongoing forearm pain from an inflamed common extensor tendon in both hands.  My right mouse hand was worse.  In late 2019, I started doing the process of getting it looked at and then had to stop when COVID hit. 

So at home, I stretched, stopping using trackpads (I have an M705 on every surface I will ever use my laptop on, you're welcome), and shifted over to either the Newtral Mouse or, no joke, the [Cutesy Beanie Baby](https://www.amazon.com/TY-Beanie-Baby-CUTESY-Dog/dp/B015EV60HG/) as a wrist rest on my main dev box.  

And then in early 2021 once I had managed to get my shot, I gave in and went to PT which made things even worse in general and \*great\* for 2-3 hours following every appointment.  Dry Needling is legit.  And then we gave up and went to surgery.  The right hand in August, the left hand at 7AM EST this morning.  

The problem is that the swollen tendon would trap the nerve so when I bent the elbow, my ulnar nerve wrapped around the elbow and stretched out.  And then it got super-swollen, so it was even bigger and even when we got the forearm to (sorta) go down, it made things worse.  And the resulting surgery is to literally pull it up on the side of the elbow with some slack so it never needs to stretch. 

I can't say it's perfect, I'll probably get 9.3 fingers back at any time and it's really really sensitive to vibration so long drives are no bueno and I'll probably wear either elbow pads or compression sleeves for the rest of my life.  But it's a massive improvement especially as I keep working on my tight forearms. 

**So your todos today:** 

1. Ask yourself about numbness, tingling, or lack of fine motor control in your hands
2. Stretch, massage, Theraband, and rest.  Hammer stretches for wrist rotation, table stretches for the wrist ROM, door stretches just in case your compression is in the shoulders (I had a touch, that \*did\* respond well to PT also known as grabbing a door and leaning forward for 3-5 minutes at a time).  For massage, foam rolling is good, getting someone to pull up a wooden rolling pin for baking and roll out the tops of your forearms is even better.  5 minutes a side every day.  
3. If you need help, go get it early.  The idea with PT is to work the muscles so they heal stronger and better but if you're at the surgery point, this'll knock out all remaining feeling in your hands when it makes all your problems worse.  
4. Completely related, dry needling looks ridiculous and is amazingly effective.  I might go out to a PT in a few months and try another round or 17 twice a week just to get the forearms loose again.    
5. It's not a bad surgery if you get that far.  I'd say a couple weeks to 90% of OG typing speed, a couple months to full strength.  FWIW, I'm following Lyle McDonald's injury diet and it does seem to work (You.... do not understand what enough protein is.)
6. Noting that I love WFH, having two setups and also an hour (or four, see ""I love WFH"") of commuting to at least put your wrists in another position and a distinction between your work and home setups might be a big part of the reason this took so long to get so bad.  

As an aside, amusingly, this all happened at *Google* and not Amazon.  Had a lot of other health problems at Amazon, but this wasn't one of them.",1,1637206788,710,3769

"Manager will ask me about my career plans, don't know what to answer!","So, my background: 2 years in the current company. Position is software engineer II for our data platform, which basically means data engineer. Earlier this quarter I was promoted to this position from SWE I. I had been working towards this position for a while, and after long (and also with a good bunch of support from my manager) I managed to get the promotion.

Now, my manager wants to ask me about my career plans. And to be perfectly honest, I have no idea. Partially because I have been ramping up in this position and taking bigger and more complex tasks, but also because I honestly have no idea what I want to do in the future, and I haven't really been thinking a whole deal about this.

Some considerations:

* I am not interested in management. Too big of a responsibility and I don't really want to move away from tech. This only means that senior and up positions are what I should be seeking for.
* I am not 100% sure I want to stay within data. Let me be clear: I am absolutely enjoying doing this. I feel I'm learning a great deal about a lot of stuff. Sadly, it's slowly starting to become the same as time goes by. Writing pipelines was challenging the first 50 times, but it's becoming repetitive, and that's a DE's bread-and-butter task.
* On the other hand, the bigger challenges I can see myself facing is to actually be able to translate business requirements into an actual, usable solution, and right now I need more business-savvy colleagues (manager included) to help me get some things straight, such as particularly complex queries or data sources that are not obvious.
* Technology is also rather repetitive. It's always some data storage, some ETL/ELT tool, a message broker, and data warehousing. Add in batch/streaming concepts, Hadoop, and some knowledge of microservices and computing and you have a decent stack already. And I feel there are increasingly less things to learn.
* I moved away from backend engineering because I also felt the work was repetitive (take some task, translate that into some form of API and data processing, rinse and repeat).
* Frontend does not interest me in the least. I understand it has its own complexities, but I already know I hate writing HTML and trying to make things pretty just because someone else thought it was a good design.

Ultimately though, I have no idea what I want to do in the future, and that includes continuing being a data engineer. And I have no idea what to tell my manager when the time comes. I have about 2 weeks to think of a good answer, so I can still sleep on any decisions or at least anything that comes to my mind.

Is it ok to ask my manager in our 1:1 if my job security is at risk?,"2.5 months ago, my manager told me I need to demonstrate substantial improvement within 4 months. The other day, I asked him in our 1:1 if I'm on pace to meet that improvement. He said no. This would make my job security appear at risk.

On the other hand, there's this form he has to fill out every 6 months and that form has a check box that asks if the employee is needing improvement. If that button is pressed, I get put on a PiP I assume. Well he filled out the form that other day and didn't press the button.

So I'm having a tough time gauging if my job security is at risk. **Instead of trying to brainstorm if my job security is at risk, would it be ok to simply just go ahead and ask?** I'm trying to gauge what my sense of urgency should be in terms of job searching. Because of vacation plans, I'd rather not start job searching for another 2 months if possible. But if my job security is down the drain, then I could start sooner. I would essentially ask something like ""I understand you feel I'm not on pace to meet expectations. If expectations are not met, how much risk am I at in terms of my job security?""

In previous 1:1's I've asked what the expectations are and I've asked him what can he do to help me reach expectations.

value of an asset vs. expected return from that asset,"tried posting this in r/investing, r/stocks, etc., but i'm getting moderated into oblivion. figured there would be some community overlap with this sub, so i'm posting it here.



quoting from [here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/the%20rise%20and%20rise%20of%20the%20global%20balance%20sheet%20how%20productively%20are%20we%20using%20our%20wealth/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-nov-2021-full-report_final.pdf):

&gt;Strikingly, net worth is still mostly tangible. While investment in intangible assets has grown relative to investment in tangible assets in many countries when broadly measured, under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence. On paper, intellectual property products make up less than 4 percent of global net worth and real assets. Intangibles do, however, generate economic returns. The OECD reported in 2015 that intangible assets had expected returns of 24 percent, the highest rate among produced asset categories.

my first question is specific. **what does this sentence mean**: ""under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence."" **what are you investing in, when you invest in google, if not in the value of its intellectual property?** i realize google has not been around for very long, in the grand scheme of things, but it would be quite a surprise if it weren't still a major player in five years, no?

now my questions start to get vague.

if you read someone like buffett or sam altman, you leave thinking that only productive things are valuable (buffett likes a sure linear function; altman likes a possible exponential function), but that is obviously in some sense absurd, not just because valuable things are also valuable, but also because it is not at all clear that there is a clear distinction between things that are valuable for being productive and those that are valuable for having a personal canon of historical value. (indeed, altman does make caveats for land, even at the crescendi of his [hymn to productivity](https://moores.samaltman.com/).) again, from the mckinsey report:

&gt;The global economy has undergone a vast transformation over the past two decades, as rapid technological progress including digitization has taken hold and investment in intangible assets has soared. Yet over this same period, global wealth has grown largely as a result of the rising value of household real estate, a historical store of value

my rough read (very possible that this is not just a simplification, but downright inaccurate) is that they (mckinsey) basically attribute this discrepancy to loose monetary policy — i.e., it has been, on average, easier to increase net worth by taking out a loan, buying a tangible/valuable thing, and paying off that loan, than by buying an intangible/productive thing.

**but then why are all the largest companies in the world precisely those that principally (?) own intangible/productive things (tech)?**

i read [something](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/) recently that includes a lemma (see the ""Scratching the surface"" section), referencing another [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3667309), to the effect that the housing valuations in 2008 were in some sense *not* inflated, insofar as the run-up basically amounted to an increasingly accurate assessment, on the demand side, of the intrinsic (even *productive*) value of living in certain properties.

i think the best tl;dr, here, is that i am becoming increasingly suspicious of the distinction, which seems pervasive (especially the higher up you go in the intellectual totem pole), between speculation, on the one hand, and investment in productive/technological assets, on the other.

Junior Transitioning From Midwest To Bay Area Tech?,"So quick background: I grew up in Northern California and graduated with a B.S. in CS from a small state school in mid 2020 with an internship at a start up and a research project with a big lab under by belt. I was doing work for my family's company up until May of this year when I (foolishly) took an underpaid developer position in the suburban Midwest and have been wanting to claw my eyes out ever since... The company is reputable in the area and the work environment is nice but I find my self doing very little coding and the pay and location are driving me nuts.  


I want to move to the urban Bay Area as a developer. Badly. I'm just wondering what the best way to make that transition would be? Since I know everyone will say this: **yes, I have been applying to jobs out there.** The point of this question is trying to know what the best strategy for someone with my level of experience and situation is. Would it be worth quitting this job to go back to working with family again so I can be closer to the Bay? The down side would be I wouldn't be getting paid as much (since family) and the company is even more no-named and a lot smaller than this one, but I can live with my folks and I would be doing more relevant work since I'd actually be coding frequently again.

I was being unsure about a certain logic,  So I have asked the senior to review the methodology that I have designed for such feature.

Then he said I do not need to make things so complicated,  just do some work around to achieve the function.

After a few weeks, he needs to take over the project  from me, and after reviewing the project, he said that I shouldn't be using such workaround here, and should be applying xxx (which was the exact method that I had told him at the beginning. And making me look like a unprofessional noob.

"When you practice leetcode, do you use “shortcuts”?","I am noticing that a lot of solutions in Python3 for leetcode or similar type problems, often contain shortcuts, i.e.:

A solution that is recursive with memo, simply using `@lru_cache` instead of actually implementing the cache or even just declaring `mem={}`.

Perhaps more blatantly, a solution for the “merge two intervals” problem that I’ve seen posted, uses `list.sort()` method. Well.... That’s most of the solution. The Nlog(N) solution is to sort the list of intervals, and then walk through them. The sort is obviously the most algorithmic part, and requires a little bit of brains, since you have to decide based on the data, will you quicksort? Bubblesort? Mergesort?

This seems like part of the point of practicing these types of problems. Otherwise when sorting a tree why not just install a library that does it?",1,1637195947,133,828

Started a new job 2 weeks ago and just heard back from a larger company - background check questions,"I'm not in CS but in a similar engineering field for about 10 years. I finally heard back from a large company that I interviewed with over a month ago. Unfortunately my timing was terrible - I was wrapping up interviews with a startup around that time. I had warned the larger company of my competing offer, but was told there wasn't much they could do. I ended up signing the competing offer but gave them a few more weeks until my start date, hoping that I could hear back before I start.

I heard nothing back and I ended up starting at the startup about 2 weeks ago, and it hasn't really been how I quite expected it. It's probably my fault for not vetting them out well enough, but I haven't been enjoying my time here. 

So finally after all this, a few days ago I hear back from the larger company and they want to move forward with an offer!! I'm super excited because it actually sounds like an amazing opportunity and I had my hopes up.

I went ahead and signed the offer. I know it's terrible to leave a company so soon after starting, but it happens sometimes and this feels like a once in a career move.

This whole time I haven't mentioned to the large company that I've already started with the startup, I just told them I had a competing offer I was waiting on and that I was still working with my previous employer on a contracting basis (which is true, I contract with them very infrequently but still ongoing).

I'm about to fill out a background check for the larger company since I just signed the offer. If I don't put down this startup that I just joined would there be any way of them finding out? Would that instantly disqualify me for some reason? And if I do include them on the background check, would that raise red flags that I didn't tell them up till now about this experience?

Thanks!",1,1637195272,337,1819

Is it normal for an offer to forbid any outside work?,"I apologize if this has been asked and answered, but I was wondering if it’s normal these days to have a clause in an offer letter that you are not allowed to engage in any “outside activities,” specifically any contract work or business activity, while you are employed with the company. I have always done freelance work on the side for my full time job which they never had a problem with and there was no clause in my contract forbidding that. Is it standard now for companies to include that requirement in their offer?",1,1637194441,95,524
How to approach when leveraging another offer for a raise.,"I am paid way way WAY under what I should be at my current company. Even though they hired me straight out of college without any internships, for someone with a bachelor's in computer science from an ABET engineering program, 45k was way too low in a medium cost of living city. 

After 5 months, I emailed my boss telling him about my dire financial situation. That once they resume federal student loans, i flat out won't be able to afford my rent. My boss told me that there's nothing hr can do until 6 months which is my provisional period. But after that, at best I could expect a 5-6% raise to keep with inflation. He DID however authorize me for overtime since i'm non-exempt. If i worked all 15 hours of overtime i'm allowed weekly, I can get up to 75 thousand a year. But of course i'm also working more than full time if I do that. 

He explained to me at length that him, his boss, and even his boss's boss were aware of how little I was being compensated but that hr is a nightmare. I work for the 3rd largest employer in my state and its tangentially related to education and has a lot of public funding. 

So they have this formula they use to calculate compensation, and they have a salary range and they won't hire someone above the midway of that range blah blah blah. 

Well that conversation was last week and I started working overtime this week. And this morning I got an offer working somewhere else as a software engineer (rather than my paltry ""programmer 2"" title here). The offer is for 65 thousand a year 40 hours. Its a contract position. So i'd be working for a large pharmaceutical company that you've definitely heard of, but my actually ""hirer"" would be this small staffing company. 

The obvious answer is ""just take the new job"". But I like my current job. something tells me I won't like this new one. I have SO much flexibility at my current job. GREAT benefits, amazing relationship with my boss (he specifically crafts tasks to help me grow and get better experience). And its 5 minutes from where I live. If I can keep this job, I want to. Also this staffing firm is a place i'd never heard of, seems very VERY small (the president of the company has been emailing me personally) and it kinda sketches me out.

But I think that now that someone else is offering me 20,000 more a year and a more impressive title, I think that might factor into hr's calculations. 

I want to approach my boss without sounding like i'm trying to blackmail my company or anything. 

Currently I'm thinking ""hey, remember that stuff you were telling me about hr and how their compensation rules follow this contrived formula they came up with? Do you think it would factor in anywhere if I was getting a job offer with much higher pay? Well funny story..."". 

Also, if I tell him I have a job offer, its going to obviously alert him that I was applying elsewhere. I don't want this to be taken as a sleight. 

How should I approach this?",1,1637193739,544,2957
Does repeating question provide a benefit or stunt growth?,"I was wondering what the general consensus is for repeating a problem on Leetcode is. More often than not I am repeating questions. If I fo bad on it, i'll repeat it in 2 days, if I do good, ill repeat it in 4 days and if I feel confident I will mark it down as done.

It's all fun, and I feel like I am learning a lot but.. at what point am I memorizing a question instead of a pattern?

Sometimes I redo a question 4 times, because I keep forgetting to do some sort of ""trick"" that is applied to that question. For example, forgetting that I should reverse through a for loop using the two pointer method, but not forgetting that I have to use the two pointer method for this problem.

So am I stunting my growth by repeating questions often? I do 3 questions a day but that includes redoing questions so there will be days I spend purely redoing questions I did last week instead of trying out new questions.

Leetcode crash course when you haven't done them in a while?,"I've been happily employed at a company for about a year now but was called by a recruiter for a role at another company.

I have a technical interview lined up next week and from preliminary Glassdoor research, it looks like it's nothing crazy but I'm expecting Leetcode Mediums which I used to be able to do somewhat. 

I haven't even looked at Leetcode for a year since I have a great job and have been enjoying the efforts of my grind when I was younger.

"Negotiating offer: Recruiter wants me to name comp expectations / competing offers first? Normal, or trying to lowball?","Hi all,

I've cleared HC @ the big G and can move onto team matching for a L4 SWE role, but my recruiter is asking me to name comp expectations or submit competing offer documentation when I get it, saying outside of those the comp team will just offer me the ""default"" package, which would be low.

Is it in my interest to name a number first? Is it actually true if I don't give a number or submit competing offer documentation that they'll just slap together some baseline package with low numbers?

Recently got hired as a new grad developer and completely lost!!,"Hello all, 

I recently got hired as a software developer at a big well known financial institutions here in the states. When I joined the company, they didn’t have any onboarding process or documentation for me to read to understand the application. I had no onboarding process to begin with and for the past 5 weeks I’ve been trying to get only the required access to login to the application. The entire process to get the roles approved for the application has taken 5 weeks and I still have no idea how the application works properly. I was given brief demos when I started but I haven’t had the chance to actually play around with the application. I was able to finally pull the code base to my local machine last week and the code base looks overwhelming and badly documented. I’ve asked my manager and other coworkers to provide any documentations that can help me understand the application or the architecture better but they don’t have any documentation and thinks the best way to learn is code.I’m not sure if that’s the actual process in other companies to help new developer get familiar with the application and the code base. My manger has given me couple of small stories to look into to improve the performance of the application and fix some bugs but I still don’t understand the application or the code base properly. Every time I ask my coworkers for demos they briefly give me demos on how things work when I didn’t even have access to replicate or test things out myself. I want to learn the application better and also start contributing but I’m completely lost. I haven’t had the chance to play with the application on my own and most times I get pulled into some silly meetings to talk about things that I don’t even know. My questions is how should I approach this situation? Should I ask my manager to give me some alone time to go through the application on my own rather than attending meetings all day? How can I understand the code base better or how should I improve my learning regarding the code base. Im very confused about this process and any advice is greatly appreciated.

Afraid my CS degree will go to waste,"I graduated with a CS degree from a good school (University of Pittsburgh) in April 2020. When I graduated I felt I wasn’t ready to apply for jobs because I barely passed my classes and had to repeat several of them, didn’t have any internships or personal projects outside of school projects, mainly because I was working 40+ hours a week in a restaurant to pay my bills. So I kept working menial jobs while I occasionally studied and refreshed on things like DS and Algorithms.

Now that it’s been a year and 4 months since graduating I’m starting to panic that I’ll never get a dev job. I keep applying places but hear nothing back. The one company I got two interviews with for separate associate software developer positions that turned out to be tester jobs, but I didn’t even get an offer for those. 

The first one was my fault because I was thrown off when the interviewer told me it was actually a testing job and I pretty much told him I was looking for a dev job, not a tester. 

The second one I thought was actually a developer job (that’s what the posting said) but it turned out to be a tester job as well but I acted like I was still interested. The lady then started grilling me on what I’ve been doing for the last year and a half and how something must be wrong with me if I can’t get a job with a CS degree in this hot market. I told her I’d been refreshing my data structures etc and talked to her about my capstone project (a group project that was an Android medication tracker app). Then she told me that I was lazy and they’re looking for motivated people. In the back of my head I was thinking I worked 40-60 hour weeks slaving away at manual labor while getting a CS degree and commuting, and your take away from that is that I’m lazy?! And this was just for a junior testing position, where I know this company routinely hires 3 month boot camp grads from that barely understand Java.

If I can’t even land a junior testing job and my degree keeps getting more dated by the day, I feel like I’m screwed and will be doing manual labor for the rest of my life. What do I do here?",1,1637189319,401,2106

Infosec Internship Offer - Good?,"So I am a sophomore computer science student with a concentration in cyber security at a small public university.

New grad bloomberg vs squarespace?,"Details:

* Both in NYC
* Pay is about the same for first year, but bloomberg is higher after the first year. I'm not sure if pay after first year matters since I feel like I would jump to another company in nyc after a year to learn more

As a new grad, I just want to learn as much as possible and have good WLB.

My plans for the future aren't really solidified but here are some possible long term goals I have in mind:

* Master's degree in CS, focused on ML/personalization maybe
* A job with in tech with interesting work - specifically one that is related to both swe and math, so maybe a team at a tech company working with ML or a HFT company? not too sure yet..
* Good WLB :)",1,1637187027,179,946

And i find it incredibly difficult to study on my own because theres just so much to learn and i learn better by being taught. i feel like i get the concepts of the code i should be implementing but when it comes to actually writing the code i feel like i know nothing, i really just understand the basics and thats it. another reason i feel like i wont be good enough is that when i learn a concept whether it be the logic or the code i can pick it up pretty easily but i immediatly forget it. i dont know what to do, its kind of too late to switch majors right?",1,1637184630,170,828
Sweating small details of my background check,"Recently signed an offer for new position and am nervous about some discrepancies with my resume and the background check (through ProForma). 

* My current position (been here for about 3 years) is ""Technology Analyst"", but I put ""Software Engineer"" on my resume since that gets more responses and more accurately reflects my day-to-day (primarily backend development).
* 3 years ago, I worked as an intern for 6 weeks since I found a better paying job (my current role), but I put 3 months on my resume since I thought it would look weird that I only interned for 2 months.
* 3 years ago, I had another internship with a startup and left after 3 weeks (put two months on the resume) since they refused to pay me. I was never paid nor given any employee accounts/ids, so I won't show up in any of their systems as previously employed there.
* For all of my work references, I put the number of the HR departments rather than people I knew. I also haven't even called the numbers to check if they were right.
* I did my freshman year of college at a different university than the one I graduated from. To save space on my resume, I put that I went to my alma mater for 4 years. On the background check, I included both colleges. 

Will any of these raise flags?",1,1637184076,231,1261
Which makes more in total comp: IC route or management?,"I am at a bit of a crossroads:

10 years experience, typical path thus far: straight dev work a few years, then more architectural stuff, now about 50/50 given the project. I enjoy being an individual contributor, but also am a rare bird in CS that seems to enjoy people.

I am located in the Midwest, and not too keen on doing any FAANG stuff at his time.

Thus, that 5-6 company outlier aside, what typically makes more long-term in terms of overall comp? I love working with people, but I also do enjoy straight dev work as it comes about.

Simply put: would management be more likely to make more the next ten years? (Putting aside emotion, ""do what makes you fulfilled"", ""it's not about the money"" -- just assume I'm a robot and asking for a simple weighing of either/or).",1,1637183967,138,777

Hired to be junior software developer - expected to now be company jack of all trades,"At the beginning of Q4 2020 - I quit my job in hospitality sales/customer service to enroll in a coding school/bootcamp. I saw this as an investment, and a career choice that would provide me with ample job opportunities, and personal, professional, and income growth. 

Beginning of Q2 2021 - I land a job as a junior software developer with a SaaS company in the hospitality and travel space. It seems like a great landing spot to start my new career in technology, and I'm hopeful that I will be a great asset to the team, while also having an opportunity to learn a ton from the senior developer I will be working with, and also begin building a strong resume, and larger skill set to eventually grow my career as well as my earning potential. (32 years old - looking to buy a home, start a family - yes income is of high importance at this stage in life)

I am immediately given assignments to write API integration code in PHP (I studied Javascript at coding bootcamp, so took a bit of time to get accustomed to PHP), and eventually given a hard deadline to write a certain number of integrations by a certain date, or lose my job. This was a stressful time, and the senior developer was largely unavailable, or fairly nonresponive at times when I needed help (which was quite a bit, this being my first job as a developer). I barely met the deadline (with some help from folks on CodeMentor, paid out my own pocket). 

As a result of not exceeding expectations on this, as well as some pressing needs in other areas of the business, I am moved off the tech team for a couple of months to assist in our client onboarding process. This has mostly consisted of juggling various manual tasks in different software programs we use that have been thrown my way. Have not been writing any code during this time. 

Am I doing the right thing by being a ""team player"" in this situation and taking on these other tasks - or should I be looking for a different opportunity where I am put in a situation to build up my dev skills more intently, and possibly be in a position to receive more direct mentorship/interaction with a Senior developer?",1,1637183238,390,2140

New grad new job but don’t want to relocate,"Hey everyone,

A few months ago I started a new job, and everything about it has been fine. Not perfect, but fine. I’ve been content and the pay has been pretty good. My only riff has been I don’t want to relocate. So far we’ve been working remote and the relocation has been pushed back a few months for COVID. However as relocation time draws near, I’m less enthusiastic about relocating for the position.

Is it worth just relocating and continuing my position or should I take the time to apply to other positions now before I have to relocate. How would that look on me as a job seeker? If I do decide to apply, should I remove the job from my resume or could I use it to get myself into a better position with the experience that I have so far? For the most part I’ve only been doing Automation Test QA and I’ve wanted to delve into development but I won’t be able to until the project I’m on is complete.

For reference I do not have any ties to the company right now, there hasn’t been any company matches on the 401k yet and I’ve been only given a relocation bonus but I don’t mind giving that up if it means staying where I currently am. I am also located in the greater New York area.",1,1637180483,228,1195

How do I deal with my boss who knows nothing about software?,"Here’s the thing. I love my job. I love my company and co-workers. The salary is good. The problem is, the owner of the company knows nothing about software and has outrageous, impossible demands. 

Just recently, I was working on a web page creating a dashboard with a bunch of graphs and data on it. I had one and a half days to do it. At the end of the day he calls me and in other words says he’s “disappointed” with it. He doesn’t have a clue how many backend stuff I had to do prior to getting up that page. Sure, it’s not pretty, but it works and does the job. When I said I need more time to make it “pretty” he just smiled and handed it over to another developer.

You might think my boss is an ass, but he’s a great guy and I love working with him. How can I make him understand that I am not just sitting in the office all day fooling around? I even send out an email every day of a detailed report of what changes I’ve made and it almost feels like I am making things worse.

Thankfully, the other devs understand.",1,1637180158,202,1026
Negotiating with big tech using quant offers?,"I received an offer from FAANG and my recruiter told me that if I gave her some of my offer information for other companies I received offers for, she might be able to bring the information to the compensation team to bump up my offer.

Or if I should stick to just showing her my highest offers at other big tech companies, since I've heard tech doesn't match quant/finance?

How much communication is required as a programmer?,"I have been working toward becoming a developer for a few months now due to feeling burnt out in my current career (insurance claims). I have since realized one of the biggest problems I have with my current career is the amount of communication required. Constant phone calls, emails, texts, meetings. Requests for information that has already been provided (sometimes multiple times) that they didn't listen to the first or second time. Requests for updates when I've made it clear if I have not made contact, there is no update. No one listens, causing me to repeat myself. There is almost no uninterrupted time when I can just get my work done. I consider myself a good communicator, but I am more introverted so the quantity is a problem.

I really want to avoid an ""out of the frying pan, into the fire"" situation. How much of the above reflects your experiences in programming/on developer teams? Is this a chronic issue in programming as well? I would really look forward to a job where there are a few specific people I need to communicate with and who actually retain what I tell them.",1,1637179501,192,1095
Feeling like I'm stuck in CI/CD pipeline hell sometimes -- is this just normal dev or is my company doing something wrong?,"I'm currently waiting for my pipeline to run so I can submit a merge request, usually takes about 10-12 minutes to find out if you passed or not for this particular project.

This is one of 10 components I need to merge into for this current project. Every component must pass build/test of course, as well as a Sonar scan, a security scan, a linter stage, and then actually upload the releases or pre-release versions so they can be deployed. 

This thing I've been working on was done over a month ago. One developer wanted a pretty minor change but due to all of these interdependencies, it took a long time for me to implement it all the way down the line. It is a matter getting project1 working locally and THEN passing the pipeline, so project2 can consume project1, so then project2 has to be working locally then passing the pipeline so it can pass it along down the line, and so on.

The actual ""meat"" of what I am working on is so minor, but all of these pipelines and scans makes it difficult to actually get my changes out. If someone wanted something as simple as adding a single field (10 seconds of development work), but that logic is added at the root of the project (our core library for example), it would probably take at least a day to get that to a state where it could be deployed.

It is just so frustrating to develop like this. You lose your train of thought so easily. I try to optimize my local environment as much as possible but it isn't always possible to not rely on pipelines and some of these projects being available in the cloud as opposed to referencing them locally.

Is this a normal thing? Is my company doing something wrong? If so, how do we fix this?",1,1637179369,311,1694

Should I continue down this SE career path?,"Hello All, could really use some guidance for my situation.

So I currently working as a Senior SE at an agency for about a year. The agency has a contract with a customer where I'm basically just maintenance support for their systems. The job pays well, but I'm just the guy that relays information to other teams. I would not really classify myself as a software engineer, I would like to be a developer. 

I graduated from college in 2017. I have very little work experience as a developer. I was not very engaged in school and learned just enough to graduate. My first job out of school was a development role but it was entirely PL/SQL, low paying and had very little room for growth. 

Since my current job requires very little of me, I try to use that free time to teach myself new skills and expand my knowledge. I have been struggling over the years to teach myself anything. Java is my main language but I wouldn't consider myself to be good at it. Whenever I try to practice or learn, nothing clicks. I sit there for hours trying to understand and it feels hopeless. I've been trying to teach myself Spring over the years so I can create something and motivate myself to continue but it seems useless.

Despite my shortcomings in learning, I do believe I have good work ethic. The customer I am currently assigned to is essentially looking to hire me from the contracting agency I work for. Managers/Team Leads have been inviting me to calls and giving me pointers on my resume so I can easily bypass the first stages (HR) of the interview process. They've told me that no real interviews will be conducted and the job is basically mine if my name appears on their list. 

I like how much I'm being paid. Sometimes I do like having free time during work hours, but I feel like I'm kinda wasting my time here. I don't feel like I have what it takes to become a developer and I feel like if I continue down this path, I will hit a point where nobody will hire me because I don't have enough knowledge in a particular category. What should I do here? 

TLDR: My job wants to hire me on full time, but the job is very boring. I want to become a developer but I don't believe I have what it takes. Should I just take the job?",1,1637178392,416,2231

Amateur wants to go pro...,"I've flirted with coding on and off for years. I learned some BASIC in highschool 20 years ago. I did a single semester of CS in uni as an elective where we learned some C++. I've been modding bethesda games for fun for a few years now, picking up bits of their in-house 'papyrus' language as I go. I once made an interface and search engine for a databse in microsoft access at a job that had nothing to do with programming (where I ripped off other bits of code that I googled and copy pasted and changed slightly till it worked). Nothing fancy, but the things I want to make eventually work the way I want them to. Basically, for years now, if I wanted to do something that involved programming I learned as little as possible to get the thing I wanted to work, and never really invested much or any time into formally learning things or doing courses.

Two nights ago I decided to try codeacademy out of boredom and worked through their free C++ lessons over the last two evenings. I liked being able to work at my own pace and I burned through the lessons relatively quickly. If I remember by C++ college course from years ago, we didn't get to vectors and arrays until like week four and there was a lot of boredom waiting for the slow kids once I'd already done the exercize for the day. With codeacademy I was able to finish one exercize and move on to the next as fast as I wanted. So I signed up for the pro version and they gave me more projects and quizzes to work on (turns out the paid content is a little more extensive than the free stuff).

One thing jumped out at me, the ""Fizz Buzz"" problem. Their intro paragraph said that is was (or maybe still is) a common interview question to test creative problem solving skills to filter 99% of prospective coders at the entry level. Is that true? Because I solved that problem first try with no help and it worked. (well not quite first try, I had my nested IF statements backwards, but I figured that out first time I ran it) Is this really a thing that people have trouble with? Is this really the kind of question that comes up in interviews for entry level programmers?

Basically, I'm 35, I have no credentials at all, and I have no time or money for a full CS degree, but I think I enjoy this kind of work and I might be good at it. Is a bootcamp the right thing for me? Should I just keep working through stuff on codeacademy? I'm probably going to finish the rest of the intro C++ exercises tonight or tomorrow, but where do I go from there?

I'm probably going to stick with C++ for now, because It's what I'm most used to, but I'm not ruling out learning other languages.",1,1637176346,498,2642
Non-disparagement clause as part of employment contract,"Has anyone had to sign a non-disparagement clause as part of an employment contract?

It's a good offer, and I would rather not turn it down after this. I am currently unemployed, and though I have been able to get a couple of other offers, I'd turned them down because they weren't very good (and they could have made me sign something similar anyways).

[Help/Advice Needed] Optiver SWE Internship Location,"Hey everyone, I've recently received and signed an offer for Optiver's SWE internship this coming Summer. I'm trying to decide between their Austin and Chicago locations. I've listed a few pros and cons of each location. Any advice is appreciated. Struggling to decide between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

Chicago:

\- Bigger Office with more amenities (In Office Barista, Game Room, Window View of the Bean, etc)

\- More employees (360+ employees); almost 12x more than Austin; \~60 interns

\- Chicago is the Hub of major HFT companies

\- Good weather in summer (rougher weather rest of year)

\- Codebase is primarily in C (some projects use C++ too)... but most roles use low-level languages like C

\- There's more projects and teams (only 1 team in Austin)

&amp;#x200B;

Austin:

\- Small Office with fewer amenities

\- Fewer Employees (30 employees); \~5 interns

\- Austin is a tech hub (not an HFT hub)

\- Slightly hotter weather in summer (rest of year weather trumps Chicago)

\- Will use C++/Python and some Machine Learning as well

\- Start-up like feel since the Austin Team is expected to grow very quickly over next few years so it'll be like watching a small start-up grow in front of your eyes

\- EEveryone is super close to each other.. they went Go-Kart racing last week and even watched Eternals together this week); they seem very close

\- I've spoken to 2 employees at Austin and they seemed super nice as well (one of my interviewers who I really liked also was in Austin)

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be really appreciated. For me, weather and office perks don't mean much because I know I'll be desensitized to them in a bit. What matters more for me is the Team and Future Job Prospects. I feel like Austin's team is really nice and that I'd get along with them easily (although I've never talked to anyone at Chicago so Idk if they're also similar). Also, the skills of C/C++ and ML sound like good skills to have in the future versus C-programming in Chicago. But a lot of people I spoke to said Chicago would be better because that's where all the top HFT firms are. And tbh working with C at the lower level sounds kind of fun (I'm not super into ML stuff).",1,1637173396,367,2194
Starting OMSCS as a career changer. What else should I be doing to get a internship other than LC?,"I’m a Biology grad from a top 50 school with CS coursework that is equivalent to a minor. Decided that medical school wasn’t for me, however, I don’t have any internships or industry experience at all in the tech industry. I enrolled in OMSCS to fill in my CS gaps as well as use it as a springboard to get a job (I live in the Bay Area). 

Other than Leetcode and working on side projects, is there anything else I can be doing to increase my chances of getting an internship/job? 

I'm not super familiar with getting referrals or reaching out to recruiters but is that something that is mandatory for me to land a position? Should I be contributing to open-source, going to meet-ups, or maybe hackathons?

 I'm honestly a bit lost and overwhelmed right now considering that I'm already out of undergrad and feeling a bit left behind in terms of all my friends who already have CS degrees and are now SWEs.

Switching jobs and being confused by job offers,"I am on notice period and have 15 days to join another organisation. I am 32 years old, single, and live with my parents.

leetcode grinding while working,"I've discovered something that, in hindsight, seems obvious now:  

Grinding Leetcode __*while*__ working on a high impact service team as an adult with a normal life and potentially other responsibilities will likely be an order of magnitude more difficult than doing so while on a longer vacation or while in-between jobs.  

In the past I've struggled with practicing on Leetcode.  And that made me think that I simply wasn't good/smart/working-hard enough.  But negative self-talk isn't going to help.  

Over this last week I've found a much higher degree of success there while not having the distraction (if you want to call it that) of a day job.

What to major in for business side of tech?,"Hello all. I’m currently enrolled in CS at a reputable university (regionally accredited) held 100 percent online. I’m having some dilemmas with the program at the moment…

I really hate the way the material is being presented. Each course lasts approximately 10 weeks. Which has been fine but I also find the way in which the material is being taught to be really backwards (especially for beginner/basics material). This makes it incredibly hard for me to retain information. Unfortunately brick and mortar schools are too expensive for me/too far. 

I also don’t have much interest in SWE positions. I’m much more interested in business ops, supply chain and PM within a tech company. Could I instead major in Operations Management while learning coding and building a portfolio on the side?

What can you leverage in salary negotiation?,"I see a lot of posts talking about competing offers and experience. I was curious about something that is a little more unique since Covid happened, massive housing cost changes. 

My city has been listed in multiple articles as a top 10 city with the most overinflated real estate market in the US. We saw housing prices go up as much as 40% in some areas in town over the last 12 months, which has caused a similar increase in rent(I rent and my most recent lease went up 25%). If my current company(local internship) comes in with a lowball offer when I graduate, is current housing costs viable leverage?

Extra info ahead of time.
This company doesn't allow fully remote. 
Adjacent cities and being slightly outside the city has seen similar housing increases so moving farther away from inner city doesn't really help.

Advice on landing cs job while I’m uni/college,"
TDLR: Trying to get junior software job but feel the barriers to entry (long requirements lists) are so high and I have no contact currently to get me around it.

I’m a second year cs major. I live out of home and my fast food job is shit since I have to work at awful hours. I’ve been programming since I was about 11, and I’ve almost held a perfect grade at university for all my courses thus far. I don’t receive financial support from parents or government, and believe me, I’ve tried.

I’ve made a plan to teach myself the curriculum for backend development set out in roadmap.sh which I plan to finish within 6 months. I’ve got access to LinkedIn learning courses for free, and I’ve aligned relevant courses to get me up to speed with these skills.

I’ve also worked as a junior software engineer before for 8 months, but I resigned as it wasn’t a great fit for me when I was just starting uni. For reference, I had connections to the boss there. I got exposure to the cloud, databases, lots of programming in varieties of languages.
(C#, JS, SQL, Python, etc etc)

Besides this, I’ve had exposure to lots of different things as I’ve programmed since I was young, and I feel that objectively I’m decent at picking up new things easily. A project of mine at the moment is to create a web scraper to put my shifts in google calendar using azure functions, nodejs, azure logic apps, etc. I’m just learning this as I go and I usually just learn what all the cloud services can do in an overview and go from there.

Right now I don’t really feel like I’m making progress towards landing a junior software role. I could reevaluate my goals and work backwards and do the things like network l with people, build projects, so up my GitHub, etc, but I’m a bit desperate. Every job search I seem to be doing are junior roles requiring years of experience, and the only roles which don’t have these long lists are internships. Who the hell is going to do a three-year internship to meet these ridiculous goals?

Somewhat long winded but has anyone felt they’ve been in a similar position, and how did you get out of it and land a role?

In-depth Technical Questions," I am on a job hunt right now, graduating from my master's. I have a recurring problem that I can not find a solution to. I have experience full 2 years before that and I worked as a student in software development jobs while I was studying for my master's. I do not apply for senior positions, only junior or mid-level, I know that I am not ready with my current skills.

So, the general structure of interviews, as everyone knows:

If I am not already rejected; HR talk -no problem, casual talk

A casual technical talk with some leads - no problem, casual talk, even crack some jokes

Usually a task implementation - most of the time no problem

My problem - technical interview in-depth with engineers

So, I can not point the problem at this step. I study for my task implementation, so I am ready for questions about the task or some other related topics. Of course, I can not answer all the questions, when I can not answer it I just say my ideas based on my current knowledge or straight up say I do not know.

I realized that, when I am talking, sometimes I am not so sure of myself. When I make a guess, I say ""I think"", ""It can be"", "" I am not sure, but"", and so on. Should I be always sure of myself in technical interviews? Or am I supposed to give the correct answer to all the questions? If I do not know the answer, should I just shut up? English is not my native language, can it be a problem, maybe I can not express myself in some technical details? Should I be always serious and technical?

I can not deny the fact that I need some studying, but I do not think that's not the whole picture. Maybe everyone is a CS genius, I do not know. I would really appreciate some general directions towards this.

If it is related, I am based in Europe.

Currently I'm Jr C++ developer and working as a technical support in small company (I know, so unrelated) and recently thinking to quit my current job for more interesting fields but so struggling what do I actually should apply for.

I need your experience to guide me.

I've got kind of diverse experiences in IT universe such as: web development, android development, networking, linux, hardware troubleshooting and naturally c++ developing.

And except for hardware troubleshooting, none of my jobs were actually in official company and mostly in start-ups or personal works. 

Although, through these jobs I came up with two fields that seriously interest me: Cybersecurity and Operating/kernel development. 
However, these two are way ahead of me and of course I wouldn't find a job like that. So I'm looking for an internship/entry-level jobs to get started and that's where I'm struggling.

Choosing between internship offers,"Hi there! 

I am very fortunate to have gotten two great SWE internship offers this summer, but I’m having a tough time making a decision and would love to hear any insights from the members of this community!

One of these offers is Amazon which is a great company to have on a resume. I’ve heard working at Amazon can get you an interview at most places for future jobs. It’s also a larger tech company and I’ve only had experience working for smaller ones. The downsides here are that I’ll be put on a random team and I’ve heard negative things about the working culture there.

The other offer is MongoDB. MongoDB seems to have a great work culture and the people I’ve talked to have all been awesome. I also get to pick the team that I work on. The internship seems really well structured as well. My main concern here is that Amazon is more well known and might open more doors for the future, especially considering I don’t go to a well known school.

Personally, I would lean towards MongoDB for a full-time role between the two, but if my goal is to learn a lot and get a good experience this summer and then apply for other competitive companies in SF/NYC/SEA again next year for a new grad role, which company should I go with? Does Amazon look much better on a resume than MongoDB, and does that outweigh the positives that I get from an internship with MongoDB?

Am I a lazy developer?,"Am I a lazy developer?

So guys, I've been working as a software engineer for about  5 years and I have such a ""weird"" daily schedule for my point of view (maybe it's not weird, maybe it's common, but I believe it's weird)

when I have something to do I break it into small tasks daily.. I have a deadline and I try as much as I can to deliver everything I have to do, but often I take long breaks after finishing some of those small tasks and rest for the rest of the day.

For example, I have to complete some sort of new feature, so I break it into small tasks, and when I complete one of those small tasks instead of proceeding with the other ones somehow I assume I finished it and then I rest.. I watch youtube, I take a nap, I go to tiktok, whatever.. I do any other thing but the following small tasks.

At the end of the day I basically code for about 3 to 4 hours and the other following moments I do basically nothing or I go to meetings.

I'm being really honest.. sometimes when I try to continue I cannot focus.. I get sleepy or I cannot concentrate for any other reasons.

Is that a normal thing that ""normal"" developers do? or am I lazy?

of course, eventually I have to put some extra work to solve some problems and I work more than that, but that's not a common thing for me.",1,1637158861,250,1294

Can someone help me pick the right specs for an upgrade?,"I've worked with a crappy laptop before finally landing a gig as a software engineer. While my work laptop is great, my personal laptop is the still the same ol' crappy laptop, so I've been saving up money over the past few months to invest in a new one that'll be future proof and last me at least 5 years without any hiccups, and that's when the new Macbook Pros caught my eye.

I've done some research and what specs would work best for developers, but, at the end of the day, I find that these review videos/articles don't really represent the real world very well. I mean, there's only so much synthetic benchmarks or one-off tests can tell, which is why I've decided to come here for help, as it seems like there are plenty of experienced individuals here to give me some wise advice.

Here are the specs I chose with my reasoning :

* 16"" Screen : More screen real estate === more room to see more code

* 32-Core GPU: Might be overkill for a developer, but I enjoyed working with 3D software and designing back when I had access to my university lab computers, and I would love to be able to do that again as a hobby

* 32GB RAM : My friend told me that I should go for at least 32GB if I'm planning on continuing full-stack development, along with tools such as Docker, as I could run out of RAM really fast. I'm considering 64GB just to fully future-proof this thing, but would be that overkill?

* 512GB Storage : Honestly, I would go even less if they had the option, as I prefer to store everything in an external SSD anyways.

I don't know if the logic behind my choices were good enough for me to truly future proof this laptop, but I'd want to go for the cheapest, yet most future proof option, and this is what I was able to come up with. Of course, I'm willing to shell out more cash if I have to. It may be a lot of money, but it isn't too bad an investment if I'm planning on using the device 7 days a week for at least 5 years. At least, that's how I look at it.

I'd love to hear your criticism(s) on my reasoning behind my choices and whether or not I should go for weaker/more powerful options. And, of course, thank you in advance!",1,1637156503,408,2156

GPA drop after intern offer,"3.2 GPA right now but it will drop below 3 this semester. I can't remember if a current intern offer I applied to was through the website or through a specific university portal, anyway, their open SWE internships all say that the GPA has to be above a 3.0.

Having a Mental Breakdown at the wrong time,"Hi all, this'll be mostly for me to vent anonymously, but I'd really appreciate any advice. It is related to a career question too, just read a little bit in to find out.

So I'm 23, about to finish my 11th and final semester in college. CS major. I switched majors a few times so I actually had to pack this semester with some really hard classes that nobody takes simultaneously. It's made me very miserable and I'm not even able to take in everything in my classes, just rushing to get HWs done. 

Every 10 days after being really productive, I'll break down and not leave my room for 3-4 days doing absolutely nothing but watch Youtube. Then I have to catch up coursework for a week and then I break down again. And now it looks like I might fail a couple of classes unless a lot of things change.

I've only been sent a couple coding online assessments in my many, many, job applications. And I've failed all the tests when I've took them with no prep. But get this, out of no where last week a recruiter for a company emails me, on an application I long gave up on. We schedule a time to talk, she seems very interested in me, we even discuss salary and such. Tells me she'll send me a coding assessment (on coderpad) and if I pass, I'll do 3 back to back live coding stuff with SWEs at the company.

Unfortunately, I am at very very low motivation right now and I have absolutely no time to prep for the online assessment. This honestly seems very rare opportunity since this is the first time, I've actively been recruited and the salary and the company is great. I haven't spoken to anyone in real life about this so I'm just putting this out here I guess. I'd appreciate any advice or any kind of response. Thanks.",1,1637139491,322,1724

"Severely underpaid, should I stay at current company or not?","I am severely underpaid for my role at my current company. I do frontend and am currently taking care(due to having made them) of the reusable components (datepickers, autocomplete, combobox, multiselects, popups etc.) as well as developing most of the main website itself. The reason why I am doing these is because according to my manager, I am very technically skilled. I am also very stringent on the graphics(I want the UI to look great). I have also led/am the main contributor in 3 projects so far in front end. 

I only have 2 and a half years of work experience(but have had projects with ReactJS in college and made a website/deployed on to GCP for my uncle) and am paid a total comp of 118k. The company is located in the Bay Area and is evaluated at 300+ million. 

I have been doing a great job and contributing a lot, but the work has been staggering/unbearable for me lately. Since we have an India team, I was getting messages from 5-7 different people on slack when I wake up in the morning and during the day I have more people asking me for help. This is because I am doing the main website which everyone interacts with. And during the day, I will have more people asking for help. I have 36 tickets assigned to me last sprint(serious) which I reassign to others since its too much. I am being pressured to do overtime due to issues being high priority.

But my title and salary doesn't match what I am doing. Other frontend developers at the same level and pay at my company don't need to help so many others. I was fine with what I doing before I got moved to developing the main website. I like front end but I don't want to lead projects anymore or do the main website anymore if I am being paid the same.

I complained about my salary, and have been told that currently is not the time for raises and that I will likely get a title promotion next year. But even if I get a promotion, the salary just doesn't fit with other Bay Area salaries. If you get 7-8 unfamiliar people messaging you daily and sometimes blaming you/asking for instant additions or fixes/ etc.. The pressure is too much. And honestly, I am fine with it if I get paid good for it/quite down for a 996 schedule if the salary matches the overtime. I have coded 20 hours no sleep etc. Every developer who joined with me(total of 10 people) have left and have urged me to leave. I feel drained. 

Thanks for reading. Let me know if any advice for me. I am not a greedy person, but there are family issues atm.",1,1637135273,465,2500
How long do you typically get to accept a return offer?,"After all my efforts as a third year university student, I'm glad to say I landed an internship. It's at a semi-large company and I'm extremely grateful.


I'm wondering though. If I were to get a return offer (my internship ends second week of August), when would I typically receive a return offer (if at all), and how long would I have to accept it? Say I don't enjoy my experience or I'd like to expand new horizons, etc. Wouldn't it be risky to reject a return offer and go internship applying again without having any guaranteed backup? Ideally I'd only reject a return offer if I have a few interviews lined up for other companies I'm more interested in, but obviously if it's in August and the duration I have to except is short, then I likely wouldn't be that far along the application process to have that assurance.

New job as product owner: need advice on turning a project around,"Hi,

I've joined a new job as PO since last week, for a really promising product.

Here is the thing though, there is a gigantic understanding gap between the business and software team.

Although there is no documentation to help my onboarding, I have already a pretty good idea of what is going wrong.

The backend dev / app is extremely mature, although there is technical debt because the dev was pushed a lot by commercial pressure.

The frontend is the issue: it started out because the software team had no staffing to fill the job. So one good willing enthousiast filled the gap but he is NOT a software engineer or part of the digital team.

It is supposed to be a mobile app but it's just an improvised angular webapp (no ionic) without unclear requirements. It is not production ready and should not be sold as such, but it has been sold already. I haven't seen the codebase but I can tell it's not done by a professional software developer, and I can tell it was done without any roadmap in mind.

They're thinking it's a good start and can be improved upon, but I think it's due for a rewrite with proper specifications and technology.

The thing is: noone from the business (including my manager) seems to realize the wall they're heading towards. Only the backend dev gets it I think, I still need to confirm my feeling with him.

How do I procede to tell the business to stop doing shit around like excited children (they're right though on one thing: the product IS promising) - 

My advice would be hire a real mobile app/ react native but it's gonna hurt feelings and I'm the new guy ?

I've rarely seen such a gap of maturity between the engineers and the business, usually when clueless stakeholders have too much powers, they also have terrible developers. Here there are great software engineers but incapable of educating their colleagues from business.

Please advise my career plan,"Hi everyone,

I am currently working as an actuary. After some reflections regarding my passion and career goals, I am now plan to switch to become a software developer. I have not taken formal comp sci classes before but have some experience coding in Python. Due to visa issues, I cannot go to a boot camp or do a part-time Masters degree. My plan is:

* Spend 2022 self-study programming and doing some side projects. At the end of 2022, apply to grad schools (I have taken GRE before and got an okay score). My targets are NEU Align Program, Upenn MCIT, NYU Tandon.
* Start grinding Leetcode at the beginning of 2023 and looking for an internship. If I cannot get an internship in the US, I will go back to my country to do one before starting my Master's degree.
* Use the first year to build foundations and work on projects/ LC.

Is this plan too ambitious? Can I start Leetcode after taking DS &amp; A? Should I apply to the Master's program for the Spring 2023?

Recruiter from top company reached out - advice?," A recruiter reached out regarding an SDE II position at a company starting with ""A"". I'm at $85K TC (Ohio) and the position averages about $230K TC (Seattle, Washington). I've been working at my current job for 3 and a half years as a defense contractor with a clearance. I kind of hate to give that up to go private sector, but I think the pay is too much to pass up. What are your thoughts on giving up a clearance to go from government work to private sector in a situation like this? I am not actively looking for a job and my pension vests in 1.5 years, but I was already considering moving and I'd love to have FAANG on my resume.

I'm basically coasting through my job right now. I put in a ton of work in college to get a 4.0 in bs-cs and then found a cushy job where I sit back and work once in a while. It's made me soft and it's kind of boring, but I've gotten to actually take time to enjoy life because of it. My small team of 4 is awesome to work with and my boss is exceptional - basically lets me get away with anything as he knows I have some sense to manage myself and produce results. Am I making a mistake to go for this? I've heard they make you work extra hours frequently but I don't know if that's mostly just a myth. I'm not afraid to work harder, but I fear that joining something like private sector, after government work, will be a shock to the system.

The recruiter says he feels pretty confident about my chances, and from a resume and experience perspective, I can see why he does. But from a coding interview perspective? I don't have any idea what I'm doing as my current job was handed to me on a silver platter by my professors. I will have a week or 2 to prepare before taking the assessment, but I'm not sure that's enough to prepare myself for this from scratch - I'm a good programmer, but my DS&amp;E is very rusty. I'm nervous that I'm going to mess this up from lack of practice - is this a really rare offer for my situation, or do I have little to worry about and there are many others like it for people with my experience? I can't even fathom that high of an income.

I've only gone to a lesser known college due to proximity to my parents at the time, so I'm kind of surprised that FAANG is reaching out. Will my college of choice affect my chances, or is experience really all that matters at this point?

I'm having trouble making a decision as to whether I should even be looking into this, as I really like where I'm at and have a clearance that can take a year or more to get. I need some context as to whether this is a rare opportunity or if I could have this opportunity without a recruiter reaching out. Any advice regarding studying for the assessment would be greatly appreciated as well - so far, I think I'll go with a little Cracking the Coding Interview, a few easy-medium LeetCode, youtube videos on DS&amp;A, and a read-through of the Leadership Principles.",1,1637127913,559,2924

Do you ever choose learning potential over money?,"Hi. I recently took a position as a senior software engineer (React/Node/AWS) for a massive corporation in the business data analytics space. It's my second senior role, technically.

I thought I was moving from a place where the engineering discipline was okay (small team of 8, very nice workflows and automation that we worked hard to setup and get right) to a place where I would be really able to learn best practices from hundreds of engineers. It didn't turn out that way. My new organization, at least with the product I am working on, is very disorganized. The stuff that makes it passed PR is unbelievable sometimes. I would complain about having no tests running in the CI process or as PR checks, but the truth is there are very few tests and low coverage. In fact, the developers don't seem to know anything about it and don't run the tests we have, so things break and nobody notices. It's the wild west, and I've already made a bunch of changes that provide some guard rails in terms of both processes and tooling, but we have folks on the team that are clearly pretty happy doing whatever they feel like and the level of investment in being much better (which we could easily be with buy-in) isn't there.

I'm making about $60K above my previous base salary, and now I have a yearly bonus which is cool I guess, but if I would have known that this is how it is, I would have stayed at my last job longer until I found something where I could really stretch my skills. So far, I can tell that this is going to be constantly cleaning up after developers who aren't constrained in making bad decisions by good processes and automation. 

I take my growth as an engineer very seriously. I am looking forward to thinking what this sub has to say about taking less money or forgoing opportunities where the advancement in terms of skill is unlikely to be strong.",1,1637125579,338,1872

Deciding between a Qualcomm SWE or Capital One PDP role as a new grad," I am a senior who will be graduating college next year and I am trying to decide between a software engineering role at Qualcomm and an associate product manager role at Capital One's Product Development Program. For the Qualcomm role, I will be working with the modem software team to apply machine learning algorithms to optimize modem processes. I do not know what team I will be joining at Capital One since it is a rotational program. My long term goals are to pursue my own start-up, join a startup in a high impact role that involves both engineering or product, or become a technical product manager at FAANG or similar tech companies.  


Pros and cons of each:  


QUALCOMM  


Pros  
1. More exciting work. My potential manager said that the team is working with cutting edge machine learning technology, patented work, etc. Plus, I feel like ML and AI are hot topics right now in the tech startup ecosystem, so having some ML background may be beneficial if I want to join some startup working in that domain. I will definitely grow as an engineer in this role.  


2. Excellent compensation package at 100k base, 25k sign-on, 10k relocation, 13k/yr RSUs, 10k retention bonus. Not as impressive compared to FAANG salaries but it will still feel weird turning down this money.  


Cons  
1. If I start off as an engineer, it may be difficult for me to transfer to product management. I asked my manager how difficult it would be for me to try out PM at Qualcomm and he said it would be like applying to an entirely separate organization since his team is an engineering focused-team. I will definitely grow a lot as an engineer, but if I want to develop those leadership and collaboration skills for me to be an effective startup leader, I may not find that at Qualcomm.  


2. Progression. Looking at my colleagues' profiles, it seems like most of them have master's and PhD degrees in ML, EE, CS, etc. I definitely know I won't be doing a PhD, and I am still contemplating on whether I should do a master's in engineering. Based on my performance in school, I know I won't be a hotshot engineer, which is why I have started looking into product management and am considering an MBA in the future. I think a mix of engineering and business background will propel me further in my career than if I just stayed a pure engineer. So I am concerned I won't be promoted as quickly as my colleagues given this.    


3. Distance. My family lives on the east coast and this position is in San Diego. I asked my manager if it would be possible to work remotely for 2-3 weeks for several (4-5) times a year (i.e. during Christmas, Mother's/Father's Days, birthdays, etc.) but it doesn't sound like he wants this to happen too often. He did say he would be flexible on this during holiday seasons and summer, but that's it. I won't have as much of a problem with distance if the job is really worth it (eng/PM job at FAANG or a high growth pre-IPO startup), but I don't think Qualcomm is worth the distance.  


CAPITAL ONE  
Pros  
1. Flexibility. Since it is a rotational program, if I find that I don't like product management as much as I had thought, I can apply to join their technology development program (TDP) for my second rotation.  


2. Location. I am considering their offices in McLean, VA or Wilmington, DE, which will make visiting home less of a hassle.  


Cons  
1. I am concerned their product program may not have as much of a technical focus since on LinkedIn I see a bunch of business and psychology majors in the program. I don't want to lose my technical edge or become rusty in my technical skills when it comes time for me to apply for FAANG or tech startup jobs in the future. However, they do send out a form for new hires to indicate if they want a more customer-facing or a more technical role, which is a relief.  


2. I am not as enthusiastic about the pay (87k base/9k sign-on/1.5k relo at Wilmington and 96k base/same sign-on and relo at McLean. No RSUs.) as I am about Qualcomm's pay.

How do you line up a job before graduation?,"If this is the wrong community to post to let me know and if you could comment the one I should post to. 

I’m going to graduate this spring with a bachelors in cs and a minor in applied math. I’ve been reading about how people lined up jobs 3-6 months before graduating and I’m wondering how they did it? If you have had this experience comment the steps you took.

Do I look for posted jobs that are actively hiring now and apply? I find it odd that companies would be willing to wait 3-6 months until I could start. 

My advisor has been very unhelpful in this and has mostly dodged the question. They have told me to apply for as many jobs as I can when I graduate. Although, to avoid moving back in with my parents it would be best to have a job lined up.

"Coworker is a nice guy, but more of a Junior developer than my manager realizes. How do I approach and bring this up?","I'm transitioning into a Lead/Senior dev role for my team, which means additional responsibilities; one of which being delegating tasks out to my co-developers, and managing things from a technical standpoint - But no people management. I have no reports or anything.

One thing I'm concerned about is **raising my voice about coworkers who aren't... as good as my manager thinks they are** (not because my manager is wrong, but because they don't have insight)

---

Foremost, we have no ""junior devs"" on the team. There are devs whom have greatly improved the last few months. I love it. Makes it easier for me to trust them and delegate more to them, since I have to start off-loading my work since I can't do it all.

**But I'm getting stressed** from, Bob, whom is a good guy. But to put it bluntly, **is more junior that we expected**. Bob actually interviewed for the ""senior"" role - but after the interview we agreed:

&gt; ""he isn't quite there yet, but we have high hopes for him to grow into that""

Unfortunately, the more I work with Bob, the more I fear that Bob is actually pretty Junior.


# At first I thought I was being to harsh of a critic...

So I gave Bob a project to himself. I had an initiative to solve [x] problem given to me from my manager. I knew what needed to be delivered: fixing [a], implementing [b], and [c]. And was told

&gt; its up to you on how to delegate, between you, Bob, Dick, Jane, Sally, Phil...

So I decided to lay out the requirements, explain to Bob, and give him the keys. 

*I didn't wanna do it myself. I wanted Bob to do it without my help, because I feared I was previously holding him back by not letting him fly on his own.*

***Both me and my manager seemed on the same page that there was no reason why Bob couldn't do it.***

---

**Unfortunately, this led to Bob getting stuck and coming to me.** 

I did not mind! Its okay to get stuck. But what disappointed me was how Bob mentioned:

&gt; yeah I'm not sure about [a]. Its not working and I don't have experience with [a] so I'm not sure what to do.

I'm not an expert in [a] either. Thats the point. figure it out. 

... after a little bit I realized that idk if Bob had the skillset to do the above. By 'skillset' i don't mean 'knowing about [a]' I mean the skillset of ""learning and figuring out something hard by yourself via reading/documentation/exploring/trial-error/etc""

**So eventually, I took half a day and did [a]... then handed Bob the keys to do [b] while I did [c]** 

Objectively, I don't think Bob could have done it, now looking back. At this point I start to get more involved in doing work alongside Bob - *at the end of the day, I need to deliver this to my manager*

**Bob is slower on [b] than I would have expected and its kinda messy and ehhhhh stressing me out...**

[b] wasn't that hard to be honest. I did [c] which was the harder part in a few hours. But Bob took a couple days. And I got stressed because I had less and less confidence in Bills solution to [b]. But he already spent 2 days on it. I can't scrap it all and do it myself... well... I could... but thats being a shitty coworker.

I **have** had to 'secretly redo' some of Bob's work. Refactor it at a later time to clean it up, and so on. Largely do to the above. its okay. and our review process allows it to be upped in quality at the time of PR. But, it sometimes leads to other problems, due to poor implementations - that I had to account for myself later. I think: ""its good for now, just approve it""

**When I have to step in, I do it because necessary but feel guilty in how that comes off**

# In addition, I see other areas where Bob is very junior-like

- When it comes to bugs, some fixes were fixes that were ""idk why it works, but this other way works now"" which resulted in causing future problems.... 
- Less input than hoped for when discussing things as a group
- Less than ideal ability to find out whats wrong rather than ask for help
- Limited ability in exploring new things outside their toolbelt (adding unit tests, etc)


---

I'm now stuck between how to go about this...

**Bob is really a Junior, so in my mind, he needs to be used more as a Junior...** Meaning, bug/simple feature work goes their way. Bigger stuff he's not ready for.


**Problem is that my manager doesn't really know (i dont think)...** and the plan was for Bob to grow to take on more. 

So idk how to approach. is this something I bring up to my manager? I feel like I need to, but don't know how without sounding like:

&gt; yeah this bob guy aint that great

- If I keep going as is, I will sabotage myself in delivery time of things. When I give someone a task, I need to trust that they can do it. I can't continue to ""fill in"" whenever they get stuck over and over.
- If I treat Bob as a junior, I kind of ignore my manager's initial ideas and sabotage Bob.",1,1637122205,893,4869

Leetcode/Hackerrank 1 year roadmap,"Hi, long time lurker here. As the title has said I want to know if any of you have any specific roadmaps to follow to ace these coding interviews for FAANG. A little bit of background story, I am currently studying computer science in the second year of a four year course. I have just failed and been rejected by a lot of companies for internship. I aced my coursework for algorithms and generally am doing well for school and even personal projects. But I am having issues with just solving these problems in the time constraint that was set. For example a company I was interviewing with gave 60 minutes to solve 4 questions, 3 was medium and 1 was hard. I managed to only do 1 and a half. Now I do not want to be depressed about what is done and gone, but definitely I want to be more prepared for next year. Right now I am doing on average around 3 leetcode questions per week, but felt that the topics were all over the place. It went from data structures to dynamic programming and I just felt like I need a roadmap to follow.

Can I succeed in computer science?,"Background: I'm in my first semester of university, and I am hoping to major in computer science. I had very little programming knowledge prior to this semester.

I am currently taking an intro programming course in python at my university, and I have been struggling a bit if I am being honest.

I understand all of the topics. For loops, while loops, lists, dictionaries, etc. The concept of each of these topics is not so much an issue for me. The main problem is the assignments. 

I was able to finish the first assignment with relative ease and did OK on it. The second one however was worse. I was unable to finish, but I did whatever I could and managed to scrape a B-. We are currently on the third assignment with just under a week left, and I have completed about half of it. However, we are supposed to write a function which I feel is quite complicated. It is really scaring me, as I am afraid that I may not be able to fully complete this last assignment either. I plan to get help in the coming days, but I am still worried.

I really love computer science. I find it extremely fascinating, and I really don't know what else I would want to do. I'm far more into it than just for the money, trust me. I love the idea of being able to create programs to perform tasks, to make apps, etc. I just find it all so fascinating, and I really want to get to the point where I can built these things myself.

I plan to do my best until the end of the semester, hopefully get a decent grade, and then practice every day until next September (which is when I will be able to take my next CS courses). 

I guess what I am trying to get at is, am I cut out for computer science? Seeing some of my classmates whiz through assignments has kind of bogged me down. I know they likely have years of prior experience, but it still makes me feel bad about myself and my abilities.",1,1637117624,356,1875

How much is a high ranking school worth?,"Hello redditors,

I am switching careers from a sale career mid level to programming. I am going to go to online school to get my first degree. I have two different options for completion and I want to know if the high ranking public school is worth the price? 

&amp;#x200B;

The first option is as I said a highly ranked public school. I would be going online so I don't believe that I am eligible for the internship opportunities and even if I was I live in a completely different state. This option would be roughly $12,000 more than option number two.

The second option is an online school. It's not a degree mill, they have a brick and mortar, but it's nothing to write home about. It is a okay school, instate so pretty affordable, and ultimately $12,000 cheaper for the degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that schools with phenomenal reputations values lie in the relationships built and the internship opportunities. With that being said, is the high ranking public education worth $12,000 or will it not open any additional doors or have a better education?

But on the other side, I got over some of the uncertainty of what interviews are like. I know what to expect, more or less. And the parts I need to focus on. I know the kinds of questions asked based on the qualifications they give you beforehand.  I’m hoping the more I apply and interview the better I’ll get.

Is it worth it to switch my major to try and pursue a degree in CS or just go for a bootcamp?,"A little background, I’m currently almost done with a finance degree, however it’s only my 3rd year in uni since I had a lot of credits from high school. I’ve always loved CS but chose finance when entering college bc I thought it would be too hard to get into the major at my school.

I’m now however having doubts about my future career in finance and really would love to be a software engineer. However, changing my major now would mean another like 73 credits to take as none of my finance ones transfer over to that major. 

Is it worth it in this field to have a bachelor’s over a bootcamp certificate? As in, would the benefit of having the degree on my resume outweigh the negatives of having to take a ton more time to complete it?

Feeling Dejected after not getting an internship,"So I didn't get an Internship this year even though I got one last year and have developed way more experience by developing more projects and getting other related experience through being a TA and getting another part time SWE job.

Feels pretty sucky looking through LinkedIn and seeing friends and people I know all getting Internships and some for the positions I applied for.

I don't know where to go from here about 88% of my applications I got no response or rejected after submitting resume. I've had some employers say that I have a ""strong resume"" doesn't look like it.

Out of most of the interviews I've gotten I either passed the technical round or there was only a behavioral aspect to the interviewing process and even through I think I nailed it, I keep getting rejected.

5 years in and I feel like I chose the wrong profession,"When I got my first WebDev job I was ecstatic. I had finally made it as an engineer in Silicon Valley and I was hungry to learn anything and everything. What I lacked in formal CS knowledge and schooling, I made up for in enthusiasm. Nearly 4 years on the job, I moved up ranks through the Junior frontend engineer leveling system at my company and got great performance reviews from my manager and generally good feedback from all others. 

Long story short, I began to burn out slowly and ignored it. I was part of a team that didn't seem as interested in front end as I was and they deferred difficult tasks and business logic over to me. At first I took it as a sign of respect and trust but now I see that they were really just taking advantage of me. At the three year mark at the company, my long term gf (and soon to be fiance) left me. It was the straw that broke the camel's back; it broke me. My work ethic tanked and as soon as it did, new (offshore) engineering management who I did not have as strong of a relationship with turned on me over the course of 2 quarters. Feeling like a shell of myself and completely defeated, I quit. 

Today is the second anniversary of that day. It took me about 18 months to even have interest in interviewing again and today I've done about 50 different interview processes. They begin well, and being very comfortable with React.js programming, I usually ace the technical screens and move along to the onsite. Several 4-5 hour virtual onsites later and I'm still here at square one. Nothing seems to matter before the onsite, and one tepid conversation or missed question within that onsite leads to a rejection. There is never feedback and each time the boulder rolls back down the mountain and you're forced to start from the bottom with less fervor, enthusiasm, and confidence. 

At the very least I learn something new each time to improve on. Usually system design, navigating cultural questions, or leetcode trickery. But each company is different and in each case, my skills are found wanting. On one hand it feels ridiculous because I KNOW I'm good enough to make an impact but enthusiasm and past achievements aren't enough to sway the swollen ego of an interviewer. The worst part is that startups and small companies seem to have more difficult and opinionated processes than big companies. I have made it to the final onsite with several big companies while simultaneously failing screens with 15 man startups. I have done countless hours of take home projects sometimes to be rejected immediately after. While generally longer and more drawn out, bigger companies seem to be easier interviews...

Tonight I received a rejection after a 5 hour virtual onsite with DoorDash last week where I gave my all. Most of the conversations went well, but I have the nagging feeling like I will always be lacking something. I will never ace the interview, some answers will always be wrong no matter how I prepare. To pour salt into the wound, the old colleagues that I outperformed (in compensation, contributions, and engineering level) went on to get hired by companies like Intuit and Google. I have onsites coming up with Coinbase and Google (somehow Google let me bypass their tech screen but there is no way I will pass based on past performances). If not for a lucky stash of crypto investments, I would be completely destitute right now. I know deep down that when the money runs out, I will probably consider ending my life.

Career change,"Hello all, 

I've recently been thinking about going back to school and pursuing a degree in Computer Science but I'm not sure if that's really what I'm after. I love working with computers and find different programming languages very interesting to learn and use. I currently have a degree in Architecture but I'm thinking of switching fields and going something more along the programming route (although this is very broad and I'm not really sure what exactly I would like to do). 

Bottom line is, my local community college offers a wide range language certificates. For example, they have C++ Language proficiency certificate, JAVA, LINUX, UNIX. and a lot more. They also have Computer science degree paths too, and as my community college is one of the biggest in IL, they have an extensive amount of paths I could take. 

But I essentially want to know if it's worth it to just go for these certificates and if that alone would be enough to get my foot in the door for a job. I'm of the mentality that you NEED a degree to really make it in an industry but I have no experience whatsoever in this sector so any help at all would be great.

One of the positions I'm interviewing for is a renewals manager for a software startup that just got a 3rd or 4th round of funding.  This position would basically be the first of its kind in which I would be in charge of the renewals process.  So building out a strategy/process for renewals going forward and then being the sole person dealing with renewals (at least the foreseeable future). 

The pay is still good, albeit it's less OTE than what a typical mid-market or enterprise sales rep would get (very little bonus but solid salary) but I'm genuinely fine with that.  This role appeals to me because it seems much less stressful and I don't want to carry a bag anymore.  

So I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts about this that they could share with me about my situation specifically or about being in charge of renewals in general.",1,1637105321,193,1046
Hired on as Engineer I but apparently bumped up to Engineer II without being told and/or pay increase,"I finally started my first position with a company at the very beginning of the year. Coming in as a junior (Engineer I, as my company classifies it), I was told I would receive the base salary that all juniors are started at, which is fine I understand that.

Just recently however I found out somewhere along the line I seem to have been moved up to Engineer II. This is great to hear from a progress viewpoint, however, I was never told and as such not given a change in compensation.

My question is: is this normal? Is it standard practice to just not receive any pay bump within a year even if you move up progression levels? I'm curious as this is my first position in this industry and don't want to come across as greedy, but these roles have different responsibilities and expectations and if the pay is the same between these two roles, I would technically need to wait to become a ""Senior Engineer I"" as that is the next step in my company's progression. Is the only benefit I have in this role simply being closer in progress to Senior?",1,1637105158,193,1049

Got 1 offer. Will probably get another in a week. What should I do?,"Hi All! I have been a structure engineer for a few years. I decided to make the jump to software. I just got an offer for Software Engineer I for 80k in a HCOL area. I will probably get another offer in about a week. I have some questions, but my main one is: how do I decide what to do? I'll provide information as needed.

1. Offer for 80k. 45 minute commute. No WFH.
2. Suspected 80k+ offer in about a week. 35-40 minute commute. Some days WFH.
3. Stay at current job making 87k + working 2 part time jobs = 140k. 10-15 minute commute. 3 days WFH. Not software.
4. Possible PhD grant(s) (sort of involving software) for funding available in April. Not a guarantee. I would keep working at the 87k job and do the PhD. 15 minute commute. Some days WFH.

Issues with Hackerrank,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this or not, if it is not, please redirect me to a better place to ask. But since it involves online assessments for a software job, I believe it still adheres to rule 1.

I had an online assessment at some company that involved essentially a rewording of this problem [https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/) and using 2d arraylist data structure instead of arrays.

I was able to ""solve the question"", but I had issues when I came across one part of the instructions that said  ""If no location is possible, return a list with an empty location, not just an empty list"" I have no idea what this means. How can a location be empty? It is not an object that I can just create a default value or null value. The location is just a pair of two integers. And since points can be negative also, I can not just use (-1, -1) as a default ""non empty location"". I don't think using null is a solution either, so I was completely lost on what exactly they wanted from me. 

I just want to learn how to avoid this type of situation in the future because I have had similar issues with vague working on Hackerrank a few years ago. I was able to take my exact code from Hackerrank and convert it from arraylist to list and run it in Leetcode and it ran faster than 99% of submissions and with less space than 50% of submissions, so I know my code works and is fairly efficient, but I ended up failing half of the test cases on Hackerrank. If companies are going to keep sending me Hackerrank assessments in the future, I want to make sure I can avoid falling into the same pitfalls and actually use this opportunity to learn.",1,1637101184,311,1737

"Told I was going to get an offer, and then was ghosted","I interviewed with a company a month ago and actually did really well on all of the interviews and technical interviews, which is strange because usually I royally fuck up the whiteboard coding questions. The job looked very promising with at least a 50% raise in base salary.

I did the final round of interviews on a Friday and got told Monday evening by the recruiter/HR person I had been talking to that they’d be offering me the position and would get in touch with me the next day. I was ecstatic and couldn’t focus much on my work the next day, refreshing my email every 15 minutes. The email never came.

The next day I send a follow up email and get a response saying that they apologize for the late response as they were traveling and delayed and didn’t get back until late the evening before. She also apologized and said the position I interviewed for was filled the day prior but she was contacting another hiring manager to confirm I would be a good fit on their team instead and she’d have more information for me tomorrow.

Well, that’s incredibly frustrating that I’d been told they’d offer me a position for a team and then straight up fill it in one day before they’d even talk to me, but I told her that was understandable as mix ups happen and that I was happy that they were looking for other spots in the company as they clearly wanted me. I figured a mix up in HR wasn’t indicative of the engineering culture there, as the engineers I interviewed with were very pleasant.

The next day comes and no email. I email her again on Friday asking if there was an update. She said there wasn’t yet, but there would be next week. I waited until Wednesday of that week too email for an update and then the Monday following that and I did not hear back once at all.

This entire experience has just soured me on this role, it seemed like an incredible opportunity for me and it seems I’ve been ghosted.

To twist the knife even further, I got a notification from LinkedIn the other day about a similar position from the same company in the same place that had just been opened. I’m strongly tempted to share the link of that job posting and ask if that was the position she was talking to the hiring manager about.
If you were told no by the other hiring managers, I perfectly understand but please fucking tell me. Don’t get my hopes up and then never respond. I can somewhat understand not responding to every single application, but if you get to the interview stage for the love of all that’s holy, just fucking send a rejection, *especially* if you tell me you’re going to send over an offer and then don’t.

Thank the lord I had the awareness to not immediately put in my two weeks notice and to wait until I had signed an offer. Guess I’m stuck in my underpaid job for a bit longer.",1,1637099631,514,2804

"New manager wants me to take lead, I want to stay in the background","I am a Project Administrator for a Telecommunications company. I have worked here since February 2020. I was hired to be project support ie. documentation, invoicing, spreadsheets, reconciliations, supporting project managers etc. Generally supporting the team in the background, without having to lead/coordinate/make decisions.

I recently got a new manager, and I'm not sure if maybe my title was confused somewhere in the transition but he keeps referring to me as a Project Coordinator and is wanting me to do Project Management training, and is kind of moving me into a role where I take the lead and am coordinating and scheduling things, making decisions and driving a project forward.

I'm not interested in that role. I have spent my whole career seeking a job where I can support in the background like I was. I've been in an administrative role in some capacity for 10 years. I've gone through a few different industries and roles in my 20s trying to figure out what's best for me, and have finally been happy with this role for the past almost 2 years. I'm not interested in climbing the corporate ladder, nor being a decision maker. It makes me extremely anxious having to do those sorts of things. Case and point, I don't even like planning events in my personal life! I also have my first baby on the way, and my dream is actually to be a stay at home mom, but we can't afford that so will eventually ask to go part time at least. My main goal in life has always been a family, and a job that I don't hate that provides enough for a family in addition to my husbands income. Call me old fashioned. 

My role thus far has been moreso, I am instructed/asked to do things, and I do them, and am valued for my work. As opposed to me deciding tasks and things for others.  

My question is, how do I relay this to him? I know its always included in job descriptions that ""duties may change as required"" but is there a point in your adult life when you can say no I don't really want to do that? If this was part of the role initially, I would not have applied. 

Any advice appreciated.",1,1637098626,381,2097
Should I ignore new recruiter and try to work with previous one from same company?,"For context, I interviewed at a company in February, passed the phone screen, and got rejected in the onsite with mixed results. 

From my understanding, from what I've seen online, people who make it to the onsite can usually interview again in the future, skip the phone loop and go to some onsite. This is what I wanted, and intended on doing. 

A recruiter from the company reached out and I had a phone conversation. They mentioned that they didn't see my onsite in their system, and asked that I do another phone screen before proceeding (although they did see the phonescreen, said it looked good, but because it was &gt; 6 months I had to do it again). 

I'm thinking of contacting the old recruiter, mentioning I'm interested in retrying an onsite and want to try to skip the phoner and set an interview for some time in the future. At least then I might get more info in context if I still can't skip the phone screen for whatever reason (they know I attended an onsite). 

Does this sound like a good plan? I want to skip the phone screen mostly due to avoiding spending an extra day in the interview process, as well as to allow me to set the onsite date to some time in the future (maybe 3 months) and not care about rushing to do the phone screen.",1,1637098272,234,1261

Has anyone been fired from your company for not vaxxing?,"OSHA vaccine mandate is tied up in court, but some companies may just follow it. There is a separate vaccine mandate for Government contractors and that is not tied up in court since its based around contracts. I work for Oracle and we have to show proof of vaccine or claim a medical/religious exemption by 12/8. No word on whether oracle will go after people who claim their silly exemptions. FYI. the number of people who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons is just people who are allergic to compounds in the vaccine and its a TINY fraction of 1% of the population. Like 1:10,000 people at most. 

Oracle just announced voluntary return to work in January other than people who are ""business critical"". I am remote anyway. So it does not impact me. If I had to go back in the office, I would not want to sit near some typhoid Mary's. I am late 40s and have asthma. I am a high risk case even if I am triple vaccinated. 

So has your company started firing people for not being vaccinated? I don't know what happens at Oracle after 12/8. I do  not know if they are going to start firing people. A bunch of people are throwing fits on teamblind about not submitting anything and rebelling, bleh. A few people fight like kids back and forth on slack (I am not touching that. you gotta be crazy to argue in a slack channel with 15,000 people in it). 

When I read a news article about the Vaccine mandates its pretty soft. Companies don't have to fire people right away. They can decide what to do. That is actually fairly smart. You don't want to wreck a business line ,but I would not want to return to the office unless we are near 100% vaccinated and the only ones who are not are people who legitimate can NOT take the vaccine.

How much will it screw up my career to job hop for a second time,"I’ve got a weird situation. 

I graduated in December 2020 from a rural college in a town with no tech sphere. I took the first offer I got, which was with GM. They baited and switched me into data entry with effectively no hope of becoming a real software dev, so I bounced quick. I plan to not even include this job on my resume. 

I then started a job as a software developer for a pretty low salary ($54k, Charlotte NC) to GTFO of GM. I’ve been here 6 months now. This company only works in contracts and outsourcing; we have no product of our own.

Manager won’t give me any more responsibilities and I’m only learning what I teach myself with all my downtime. My manager is not a pleasant person and the workplace is a bit racist. High turnover after one year. 

I’m getting attention from recruiters on LinkedIn for positions that pay 60% more at minimum. Would it destroy my career to bounce a second time, particularly if I leave GM off the resume?

Job not matching description: what to do?," Throwaway account here.

Hey all, I'm a new [M.Sc](https://m.sc/).  graduate who had previous experience in Software Engineering / ML  through internships and a good track record of accademic pubblications  (Machine Learning). I'm based in Southern Europe.

After  receiving some offers, some of which were in academia and other in the  industry, I decided to join a company that makes financial software  tools with banks as the main customers. The company has about 500 people  in technical staff and is part of a larger group counting 10k  employees. The wage is quite good.

I started two days ago and I realize they blatantly lied during the interview process because:

\-  I asked how many direct managers I would have and was told 1, I  confirmed to them that I don't like having more than one manager because  more often than not there is drama. On my first day at work I find out I  have 2 managers.

\- I was told I  wouldn't need to travel. Now, I found out I'm the only member of my  whole project that is based in my city. The rest of the team is based in  a city 200 miles from here so I'm spending my day in teams calls. I  feel like they should have at least warned me of this. Moreover, they  haven't formally requested it yet, but they've already casually asked me  if I'd like to pop my head in the other city.

\-  I was told the job split would be 80% backend engineering and 20% data  engineering/pipelines. I also checked in with them to confirm they had  no short staffing issues. First day on the job and I get told by my boss  that due to short staffing I'll actually need to do more like 60%  backend and 40% frontend.

I couldn't care less for frontend as I want to work in a data-centric field.

What should I do? Confront them? Leave just because they lied? Put up with it and see where it goes?

I want to quit my internship after one month," A month ago, I was hired for an internship at one of the most famous IT companies in my country. The internship is unpaid and lasts 5 months. I was extremely proud and satisfied and expected to learn a lot. Each intern got their own mentor, and we were told we would be doing technologies like Angular and Node js. I thought, ""Okay, this is an ideal opportunity to learn something new."" But the last month of my life turned into a nightmare. I do absolutely everything myself, and the mentor just reviews what I did. We have no education or lectures on what we do. I go to college at the same time, and it’s impossible to keep track of both things. The internship takes me at least 8 hours a day. The mentor often responds slowly, and sometimes doesn’t even know how to solve a problem I’ve encountered.

"If a posting lists the salary range in the description, how do you handle salary negotiations?","I've read up and down that you should never throw a salary number out first. After my second interview, the recruiter followed up, asking me what my salary expectation was. The job description had a cash salary range listed at $125k-145k, though it varies based on experience, skills, etc. I tried a couple times to defer, but the recruiter was persistent, asking what I was looking for. I ran out of ways to avoid answering, so eventually I said my range was $150k-160k. After all the interviews were done, they came back with an offer for $155k. 

Yes, this is higher than what the description said. And it was exactly in the middle of what I asked for. But I am a bad haggler, and there's a part of me that says if I throw out a number, and the other party accepts without negotiating, then I sold myself short.

What are your thoughts? Would you hold the line and never give an expected salary until an offer is made? Or did I negotiate fine and am just overthinking it?",1,1637095034,179,974

Counter offer taking a long time - what to do?,"Hello,  


Just for context

I'm based in Canada with 1 YOE in full stack development and currently working.

I recently went through a full stack development position at one of large grocery chain in Canada and received an offer Nov 5th (Week and half?) through the phone for 70k.  


I counter offered for 75k  and they said they would get back to me after they contact their compensation team.  


Fast forward to now, I've been in touch with them, however, ever time I get in touch they said they are still waiting to hear back from the compensation team and would let me know this week.  


Now, I'm speculating whether they are just waiting for me to cave into the their initial offer or it's actually taking 1 week + to hear back in regards to my counter offer.  


Any insight would be appreciated.  


Thank you",1,1637092111,151,820
From frontend to other areas,"Hi!  


I've been a frontend developer for the past 4 years or so, and have developed applications in php, vanilla js, angular and react, and well, being upfront: I think I am **bored** of frontend development.  


I currently work in an amazing company, the pay is good (but somewhat lower than the average), but I don't have the thrill to do the work anymore, every sprint is just fixing things and working on the design systems, and while I have no problems at all, and can deliver ~~dubious~~ quality code every sprint, I don't feel motivated at all to stay in this field. Though I know that it must be like that in every other area of software engineering.  


So I was doing a casual article reading and got interested in webgl and computer graphics, though I am not sure I should invest my time learning it (I followed some examples and it was quite complex to me), as I don't know if it will be a profitable career in the future (but it seems like so, with all this change towards digital worlds and all \[~~meta~~\]).  


To summarize, is computer graphics a thing? Should I change my learning focus from frontend to learning opengl, vulkan etc? Are there jobs related to these tecnologies?",1,1637091866,218,1199
Which offer should I take? Palantir vs Morgan Stanley,"Recently received two internship offers, one as a Forward Deployed Software Engineer at Palantir, and the other as a Technology Analyst at Morgan Stanley. 

I hear that Palantir has a better reputation in terms of technology, but I was worried about pigeonholing myself in the Forward Deployed role and not being able to move on to pure Software Engineering jobs in the future. 

On the other hand, the role at Morgan Stanley seems to be a more traditional software development role, where I would be more involved with development - it also has a much better location and balance in terms of quality of life.

I would really appreciate it if people could give insight/advice about this!",1,1637091192,116,687

But this last month has been horrible because there are some problems with the higher ups and my department was under heavy fire. The attitude of my managers shifted, every idea I shared with them was put into a backlog because ""now we can't afford ourselves to make time for that"" and I even endured a manager lashing out on me for a very petty reason (a task got delayed because a new undocumented bug appeared after solving the main issue).

After that problem I reached out to my boss to tell him that I wasn't comfortable with the latests events and he was very supportive. The next week the managers started treating as a human being again, but I feel like I can't go back to my previous self and getting as engaged with my tasks and ideas as before.

Unethical job search as a new grad,"Using my throwaway for obvious reasons. I’m gonna be a new grad soon with a very low gpa and no relevant internships. I wanted to outline my experience job searching and receiving an offer. Now before I do this I want to make it clear that I know I’m a piece of shit for doing this and I don’t recommend anyone do this because the stress and anxiety of it all is not worth it, regardless of if it works or not. I am mostly doing this to clear my conscious tbh. 

Like I said I will be a new grad soon, this spring. It has taken me 5.5 years to receive my bachelors. I have a 2.3 GPA currently with a non-CS STEM degree (Physics) and CS minor. I originally did not take college seriously which affected my ability to get internships. I understood that without internships I would basically be screwed when trying to find a job and became extremely depressed and anxious about my future, which also affected my schooling. I have failed a handful of classes, one class took me 5 times to pass. And before anyone says I’m privileged I live with a single parents with 3 other siblings, I receive no help and currently have 70k in student loan debt. 

Now to the job search. Like I said I knew I would be fucked. When I first started searching I took the advice of this sub. Left my gpa off my resume, did personal projects and tried to focus on those in interviews. Notice how I said interviews, I indeed get a handful. However with my debt I really wanted a job lined up for when I graduated so I wanted more chances. This is where the unethical stuff comes in aka lying. During one summer I worked for my ex’s fathers company, very small and nothing to do with CS. I knew the only way background checks would be able to verify this is by calling them directly. So I put the company on my resume and labeled that I did SWE work as an intern. Doing this with no other changes got me significantly more interviews. I even got to the final round in a few. However in these interviews it was always brought up that my gpa was not on my resume, and I was asked what it was. In the moment I would lie. I knew eventually they might find out but I wanted the interview experience. 

After these experiences I took an even greater risk. On my resume I put that my gpa was over 3.0. Once again this resulted in even more interview hits. It got to the point where I was having 3-5 interviews/phone screens every single week and it was honestly overwhelming. I had interviewed so much at this point that I was able to talk convincingly about my fake internship and the work that I did there. My gpa also was never brought up in interviews again. I would specifically apply to jobs that made no mention of gpa requirements in the hopes that I would not have to submit my transcripts. 

Like mentioned before I eventually did end up receiving an offer for a position. This was contingent on a background check. I reached out to my ex and told her that when they call to give the title and dates that were on my resume. They called, she verified everything, and the background check cleared. There has been no mention of submitting my transcripts and I am all set to start in early June. Overall I applied to approximately 200 jobs over two months. I only did 3 leetcode easies, 1 medium, and 1 hard. I did not have to do any assessments for this position. All bullshitting. Like I said I know I will receive heat for this but I wanted to give my perspective since I recently saw a post asking what happens to people who bullshit through college. I regret not applying myself earlier and doing better. I will most likely delete this post later but will try to reply to any questions",1,1637086672,693,3663

Company considered retracting offer after pay discussion: what are your thoughts?,"I recently got a job offer and as part of it (as is normal) I started negotiating salary.

Big Tech vs Salary increase,"Got hired in a big tech company less than 6 months ago but been working on the side for a startup. Startup wants to hire me full-time for almost x3 of my current salary

"Tech seems to be full of dbags now, how do you deal with it?","I think one of the results of tech being such a popular area now is that it is getting filled with non-technical people.

Which alone is not a problem of course, but tech seems to be full of people who…shouldn’t be there. Like, I swear 90% of them don’t actually do anything. Tech “managers”, all kinds of HR people, product owners, advocates, sales people, coordinators…I know technically they have jobs but it seems like they cause 90% of problems, and 90% of those problems are will be solved by tech people.

For info, Im a CTO so like 20-30% of my job is meeting with non-tech people. And I swear 90% of them have no clue about technology. They don’t even understand their own products other than the pitch deck somebody else wrote. “UX experts” having an eye watering hourly rate but only copying other people’s work….Also, not even understanding the technical limits of the platforms…Sales people cannot answer simple questions about their platforms…Product managers managing nothing because the lead devs do the actual managing…Etc

The list just goes on. Its like douchbaggery, empty buzzwords and politics everywhere. 

I’m stressed out trying not to hurt people’s feelings who should run a hot dog stand, not tech companies…Anyone feels the same? Tech used to be a bunch of nerds discussing D&amp;D, now its like engineers are actually looked down upon or at least treated as necessary evil.

"Considering dropping from CS job to do programming only as a hobby, has anyone tried that?","I've been working for around 4 years as a developer, and all of my jobs have been relatively laid back as I just need to work 40 hrs per week, however, I'm starting to play with the idea of leaving the job field altogether.

I love programming for myself, I'm always making side projects related to low level stuff and I love to learn about videogames and how things work, it's what keeps me motivated to learn more programming. However, I just can't stand working on corpo projects, spending my time on irrelevant bugs and features plagued by huge amounts of technical debt. I hate spending time on pointless management meetings and having to meet the expectations of someone that wants to climb to the top of the salary ladder. All in all, my dev job kills my energy and motivation to do programming for myself.

Additionally I can't spend as much time programming or playing games on my free time because it involves sitting in front of a computer for even more hours, and that's not healthy at all.

"Help me decide between offers, I have one day left","I am a junior in college and I currently have 3 tech consulting internship offers I am deciding between for this next summer (I have 1 day left to decide so any advice is appreciated).  


1. **PwC - Cloud and Digital Technology,** specifically the Salesforce team in their New York office
2. **EY - Cybersecurity** Tech Consulting - Atlanta office
3. **Deloitte - Risk and Financial Advisory** \- Technology - Atlanta office

**Pay differences (hourly):** EY is highest, then PwC paying $2 less, and last is Deloitte paying $3 less than PwC. I am not too worried about pay since it is just an internship but I believe these would reflect their full time offers so I am also trying to keep that in mind. 

For context, I have no experience in consulting, and I haven't taken any cyber or cloud classes yet so I am not 100% sure on what each one does. I have been leaning more towards cloud since it seems like a broader and less technical field. I am a Management Information Systems student, so my technical skills are pretty lacking lol. Another reason why I liked PwC is that I would be in the NY office which sounds pretty fun since I've lived in Atlanta my whole life, although I have a feeling I could ask EY to switch my location to NY as well so I am not too worried about that.

Education advise,"Hey guys, so I was wanting some advice/guidance/general thoughts regarding what I should consider or do for education. 

So a bit of back ground I got a BA in Anthropology and a BS in GIS I’m currently working for a city that offers tuition reimbursement. I work pas a geospatial programmer/analyst/admin

I landed this job by learning a bit of Python, familiarizing my self with automating workflows, and automating my old jobs work flow. So now that I am in a better financial position and have a job that is offering me tuition reimbursement I’d like to go back to school (I actually wanted to go back for a while now even before this job) however I am not sure how to approach this. So I really like CS and what all it does, I can learn stuff on my own specially with this job but I genuinely like school and would like to go for a masters. I just don’t know how to approach this. I have looked into Masters programs but they require a bunch of courses that I didn’t take since I wasn’t a CS major. Which I don’t mind taking them since I’ll learn a lot along the way(but like one that’s annoying is the Math not bc I don’t like it but bc the pre req is calculus but the pre req to that is pre calc and the pre req to that is like trig lol like it’s gonna take along to just meet the pre req) . So should I get a masters ? Should I just got for an associates? A third bachelors? A certificate? I guess the question is what is my end goal right? Well I don’t want to do this for the money but I do like that software developers get paid very well. (Right? Lol) so I started as an anthropology major focusing on archaeology and still love the field but they don’t get paid well and you really don’t get to lead excavations or research until the masters level, so I fell into GIS bc it incorporates into Archaeology very well but also the plan was that I could land a great job that paid well which would help me fund my masters education in anthropology but also I really enjoyed GIS. So right now I could do that but I still want to also peruse a higher education in the tech sector which my interest in it initially grew through GIS. 
Again I really like CS and so it feels like the same thing as before where I want to peruse an education in CS which can fund more education in anthropology later plus I can be learning something that I seem to enjoy.

Roles that you can move into after being a network administrator?,I’m working with an apprenticeship program and am possibly getting a position as a network admin. It’s a 12 month program and I can either stay with the company after or move jobs. I’m just curious if there are any other positions I can expect or look into down the line as far as progressing in this career field. What other positions would someone who has experience as a network admin be able to move into either with just their job experience or a minimal additional experience they may gain on the side outside of their role?,1,1637078121,97,530
Is this rejection rate normal?,"I've been hearing a ton lately about how the market is crazy hot and that it is easy to find new jobs. However, I have been casually searching for a new position for the past couple months with disappointing results.  

From maybe 50 applications (some knee-jerk one-click applications, and 20 or so 'real' applications), I have made it to the virtual on-site four times. So far, I have been rejected from three and have one pending.  I know this is a relatively small sample size, but on top of a full time job this has been draining. Each of the four interview processes took at least 10 hours out of my life. I'm not going to quit, but to be honest I'm getting discouraged.

Is this a normal response rate? Is it a red flag regarding my skill level that I haven't landed job yet in this 'crazy hot' market? 

For some background, I have a little short of one year of professional software engineering experience w/ Java and four years of IT/cybersecurity experience, as well as a couple small projects on my GitHub (willing to share if anyone asks). I just finished my Bachelors last year. I'm leaving my current position because it is a bad environment. I have been applying to fully remote positions, generally asking for 1-3 years of Software experience. I improved my resume about halfway through the process and think it is now pretty good (IMO, of course).

Any suggestions would be helpful. Should I keep doing what I'm doing? Do I need to stop and reevaluate? 

Thanks.",1,1637077256,263,1480
Insights on Adobe Internship,"I have recently received summer SWE internship offer with Adobe! I am wondering if I could get insight from a former summer intern on their experiences and how much they enjoyed their internship! I have been reading other online posts and I have heard that they hardly extend full time offers to their interns. Is this true? Additionally, I have heard good things about the WLB at Adobe for full-time, but what about the WLB for an intern? Another question that I would be the amount of responsibility that is given to interns? If all of this is dependent on the team that I am assigned to then which teams should I be on the look out for if I do not want to work overtime every week? I would love some more insight and clarification",1,1637076936,136,733

It's now viable (even profitable) for companies to let employees/candidates spend some time working for a good cause. Why do they refuse to?,"Conventional wisdom would say letting employees work for charities and good causes is a massive resource drain, but that has been dramatically changed by remote work. It's now viable to fit blocks of 'micro-volunteering' into normal day-to-day schedules without leaving your desk.

More importantly, there there are increasingly common business activities that:

* A: Can be replaced with impact alternatives with relative ease
* B: Where the impactful alternative would actually provide superior value

For business activities that meet the above criteria, there isn't even a time-cost to volunteering, because it's time that would have been spent on the activity anyway! The two most obvious examples are:

1. Replace the **fictional** case studies and tests in the hiring process with real-world (remote) equivalents that allow candidates to solve real problems for non-profits.
2. Replace traditional L&amp;D activities (i.e. useless seminars/workshops) with real-world (remote) training where employees solve real problems for real non-profits.

I have been speaking to different management teams and it seems that, even if they agree with the viability, they don't have any desire to change. I started a [company](https://www.impactdistributed.com/) to try kick-start this change by doing all the implementation/coordination for companies, but the resistance has been the same.

I know it is too much to hope for altruism from companies, but why resist if you genuinely believe it can drive profit and competitive advantage (e.g. attracting better employees, increasing engagement and tenure)? 

Does anyone have any insight on the matter? Has anyone came across companies that are actually trying to direct a significant portion of employee time/skills to good causes rather than vanity volunteering for PR purposes? Would it make a difference to you if your company let you do skilled work for good causes?",1,1637075802,280,1914

Asking for too much TC?,"I'm looking for front end/full stack jobs now after 7 years at my current company, over 10 years of experience, so I've totally forgotten what interviewing is like, but I've started to get concerned I might be doing something to sabotage my chances at getting a new job. I feel like I am interviewing well but then getting to the end of the interview process and being told 'we are going to pass on you'. I ask for feedback but no company responds.

The primary concern is that these companies are seeing what I'm asking for and at the end of the process and saying 'nah, he's not worth that'. I'd generally qualify that I am not blowing any minds with my answers for coding challenges or system design problems, but I am solving them correctly and quickly. Is it possible they are saying  'yeah, he's a solid senior dev, but not one that's worth what he's asking'. To put numbers to it, I am asking for 180k base and trying to get to 200k. I based the base on what I'm currently making in a LCOL area and what that would translate to when I move my family to the NYC area next year. All my opportunities thus far have been through external recruiters putting my name in for these companies, so presumably that number has been relayed to them.

Is it possible I am asking for too much TC and that companies don't try to negotiate a candidate down, even if they like them? Cause I'll take that feedback right now. I already feel like I'm punching above my weight for TC and I'm getting sick of interviewing, so at the very least I'll entertain the conversation.

Major Advice,"Hello everyone,

I have been double majoring in CS and DS at UW-Madison until now and I have taken a fair amount of classes in both CS and DS, but my interests incline more towards data science. I have 2 CS electives, advanced math, and a software/hardware course left. I don't seem to find any interest in OS/Compilers etc. I wanted to take Software Engineering but it's not being offered in the Spring. I honestly feel more inclined towards data science, even based on my past internship experiences and the courses I took on campus. Also, the internship that I'll be doing this coming summer will also (most probably) deal with AI/ML. I don't if it sounds like the right decision but I'm thinking of taking more data science courses and planning to just end up with a minor in CS and a major in DS.

I gave up on programming... and it feels good.,"**TL;DR: Make your experience coding, and do not feel like a failure if you do not go ""all in"".**

Hi everyone, 

as this community has helped me throughout my journey, I wanted to give back, by telling my story. Hopefully it sparks some ideas, inspiration, direction or at least some good time wasted :)

Beginning of the year, I quit my job (at a FAANG company) to pursue a boot camp. Why? Because I was always interested in coding and solving problems. In former jobs, I used to consult (hence a lot of Excel/Spreadsheet work) and work very closely with Product Managers and Developers. 

The bootcamp went well, and at the end of it I understood a very basic OOP language with added JS, SQL and HTML/CSS - hence all the basics to be a web developer. I generally started the bootcamp with a huge interest in product management but with this bubble I was immersed into, I was more and more dragged into the idea of becoming a backend developer. My main goal was always to have a remote job and to work location independent - not particularly being a freelancer or being self-employed, I enjoy/don't mind working for a company.

After teaching and job hunting for some months, I landed a job as a junior back dev. I was happy. When I finally started my new job, it hit me like a truck. My brain does not think like a dev. Due to my previous positions, I developed a very strong customer experience/satisfaction view on things, always questioning what the benefit of features are - ""Why is this needed? How does the customer engage with it?"". In my personal experience (I know some of you might see that different, but circumstances showed it to me this way) I saw, that developers rather think about the ""how to solve a problem"", and less about the ""why"". 

I simply did not feel as good coding full-time as I thought it would feel back when I finished my bootcamp. I took my time, to think about my decisions and - here comes one of the hardest things in life - be honest to yourself. I was romanticizing this job because of (1) potential high income and (2) remote job possibilities. I simply was blinded by it. I decided to leave my dev job.

Now I am starting a Strategy and Project job in a tech company and work closely with developers and product managers. I understood that Google AppsScript and doing some Spreadsheet magic is enough ""coding"" for me to be satisfied. I see that I flourish more in this role and hence have a higher chance of getting what I want and being okay with it. If I enjoy doing something, then (1) I have a higher chance of being good at it than other and ultimately getting appreciated and paid more - and additionally I believe that if we do something we love we can resist a higher level of stress for it. 

Regarding my main objective of working remote (personal opinion - feedback welcome): Corona has proven that - at least for tech companies - remote work is possible. There are many more jobs that can be done remotely than just coding - e.g. Product Management, Project Management, Account Management, etc. I hope that at least Corona proofed this to a lot of companies.

Concluding: I think coding is still a beautiful job, and I love doing it by myself. I enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when solving something. I just see that in this whole construct of developing an app/website my part might not be the one of a dev, but I might excel rather in strategy/project management. Giving up on coding does not feel like a failure, but more like a confirmation that it should be a small part of my professional life, and I am thankful for the skills I learned and experience I made.",1,1637072844,655,3626
Aren't big tech companies supposed to value strong fundamentals and problem solving skills over 'knowledge'?,"For context, I'm a freshman at some university in the EU and I applied for multiple internships at big tech companies.

To my surprise, a recruiter contacted me via email very shortly after applying (less than a week) for a front-end internship at one of these companies and we scheduled a phone 'conversation' in which they asked me some technical questions.

First off, I wasn't expecting a technical interview with a recruiter, so I mostly prepared by answering questions such as 'why do you want to work at our company?'. 

Secondly, the questions were not the type of questions that I expected from a technical interview at such a big company. The recruiter asked me about some JS methods that I had never used in my personal projects and weren't actually that common (from what I read online). I didn't want to google the questions during the interview as that might have backfired, but after it was over, I could find the answers to most of them in less than 10 seconds. I was expecting some leetcode-type questions, or at least something that didn't involve memorizing the JS documentation page.

Lastly, one question that was really weird to me was ''What is the behavior of the 'this' keyword?''. I obviously asked for some clarifications but the recruiter didn't seem to know what they were asking me and just repeated the question. I politely said I didn't know the answer and we moved on, but that was definitely the biggest red flag for me.

My question is, has this happened to any of you before and is it normal at big tech companies to be asked this kind of technical questions by recruiters that don't even understand what they are saying, or was I just unlucky?",1,1637072551,291,1680

Could I find a remote job as a new grad?

I transferred here with a 2 yr transfer degree in psych so I have a lot of catching up to do with the CS pre-requisites and it'll probably be a year or so before I have the skills for an internship. I've been told internships are vital, so that's been on my mind a lot lately.

Unfortunately, I live in a small town, and commuting to the nearest city (which is exploding with tech jobs) is really difficult.

About to be PIP due to poor performance,"Almost 2 yoe (a hw &amp; sw company), couldn't keep up with workload.

The higher seniors were swamped with work and was difficult to get help from any mid level engineers. A senior that I was working closely with would get mad &amp; paranoid if I didn't understood or made minor mistakes. Never got a praise for things that I've been doing correctly.

There were some important coding mistakes I made (unintentionally) from 3 months ago were found out, adding fuel to fire.

1. The fintech startup is saying that the SaaS industry will grow like crazy and I can ride the wave to riches. I will become a senior engineer and architect sooner. E-commerce time was 12 years ago. And they are aiming to become a Unicorn startup and my ESOPs will make me Richie rich someday. They also said that the pre-IPO company, Myntra/Flipkart stocks won't increase as much now as it has already matured. We can't even count on it being x2 times, in fact, many companies' valuation decreases post IPO (I don't think that will happen to Flipkart!).  
2. The E-commerce startup is saying that they are a part of a huge company that is eyeing a bumper IPO soon. I will be given the freedom to take up the kind of work I want to grow in my career.

"I want to get a job in the tech industry, but I have issues.","I want to get a job in the tech industry (specifically web development), but I have a few issues stopping me:

1. I don't have a degree. I attended university, but was never able to make the grade and dropped out.

2. I don't have any experience in the field.

3. I have started using resources like freecodecamp, and Udemy, but I feel like I'm going nowhere.

Are there some or a lot of companies in New York City or Silicon Valley that will hire a self-taught developer?,"I feel like recruiters and some of the people that do the hiring will not even look at your resume if you don't have a degree. How true is this? Or is this not the case?

Do you still have a good chance of getting a job with a portfolio?

Do you need to expect a lot of rejection if you don't have a degree?

Are certifications like the Oracle Java certification that you have to pass a proctored exam I think to get useful? Or do you just not need to do this? This requires extra memorization so it's better to not do this if you don't need to.",1,1637061875,107,545
Is “I want to work at a place where I have an impact on more people” valid reason for leaving?,"I am a recent graduate with under a year of experience and work at a quant/HFT firm as a software engineer and I’m getting pretty dejected that the features I implement and the big changes I bring to our software that we spend weeks planning/implementing will only be ever used/appreciated by a handful of niche traders. I have always wanted to work in this industry because of the impact it has on people and the interesting problems I get to solve - now I get to solve a lot of interesting and complex problems but the impact is pretty much on a few traders who then end up making more money for the company. After graduating seeing the big money they were offering I took the role, now I regret it, I want to jump to another place where I can work on software that will impact millions or work on things that will help others make impacts on millions. 

However, I do not know if I will get thrown away during the interviews if I reveal that is my reason for leaving, would you turn me down - should I make up another reason?",1,1637061848,195,1028

How do I ask for a promotion without it blowing up in my face?,"I've worked incredibly hard over the past two years as an analyst, doing tons outside my job description going above and beyond. My direct manager who is new to the team is unsupportive and doesn't really do much to recognize my efforts. My past manager and director of our department are people who I'm more familiar with. I brought up the topic of being interested in promotion last year with the ex manager and he never relayed any of it to the director. So neither set me up for success



So I've scheduled a meeting with my director to run through a PowerPoint of all the value I've brought to the team, and what I've done outside my job description, how I've been successful.

How do I make the change to tech from finance/accounting?,"so I (28 year old male) work in data entry right now and I've worked odd jobs for the past few years doing contracting for companies like facebook and robinhood in the bay area of california. I got a bachelor's in economics and an associate's in accounting. I've essentially been working towards finance (fp&amp;a) and accounting my entire adult life, but now I'm weighing the options of sticking with this and getting my cpa license or getting into tech. I'm from San Jose, CA and I don't want to leave California. For those who don't know, Bay area is huge on tech.  


Problem is, I know nothing about the industry or what sort of specific positions there are, nor do I know what it would take to land a job. I heard some people say that I could get a job in programming or coding without having an actual degree in CS if I teach myself the material and can show what I know via interviews and projects. But, that would be another huge time commitment. I want to get somewhere before I'm 30. I want a career job before then. So, I'm trying to see if the mountains I'd have to climb are too big to get into tech.   


It appears people unanimously agree that CS has better pay than finance/accounting and I'm planning on trying some programming classes at my old community college seeing how I like it. I just want to know what steps I'd have to take to make a career happpen.

"Newly Graduated, need advice (M21)","Hi all, I need some thoughts and suggestions on my current dilemma. So I've finished my final year and got a 1st class honour, however this year has been utterly shit cos of the pandemic and I feel completely burnt out and unmotivated. Now that I've got my results, my parents are pushing me into applying for jobs cos the training opportunity would be beneficial along with a bit of cash. But I don't feel adequate nor confident in my coding skills, and having a lack of experience bums me out. I was planning on doing an industry year but covid, and I'm at an all-time low. Not to mention that I've been very depressed this year because of the pandemic and other family related stuff that's occurred. 

I've been thinking that maybe I can work on a project and do some recap of modules from my course, whilst working part time (for some cash on the side) to re-spark my interest in programming, feel more confident, and at the same time have something to mention in my CV to fill the  'Experience' section. 

At the moment, I'm looking at my tech CV and feeling very pathetic about it. Maybe this is just my low self-esteem talking, but I just want to hear your thoughts on it from an outside perspective, cos I've just been in my head for far too long now.",1,1637045437,234,1259

Good salary for senior Frontend engineer in Boston?,"I got an offer for $136k at a co in Boston. I don’t know anyone who works there, is that a fair salary? I’ve got 4 years experience as a front end, but 7 years in digital and web based work.",1,1637044623,41,190
"Thinking of changing into information security/pentesting, need advice on how to get there","After spending some time doing real programming jobs, I've learned that I kinda hate it. Constantly getting thrown around from feature to feature and leaving a bunch of shit hanging, bad project management, fixing legacy code, dealing with awful data... ugh.

However, I find security-related work much more interesting. I pwn prolifically on some CTFs and it's something I can get very passionate about and watch hours melt away into moments doing. I've written some security tools and working on some open source exploits and innovative malware to maybe beef up my Github with some security-related shit, obviously I'm worried though about people taking the open source projects and using them for illegal purposes but so long as I disclaim I hope I'm fine.

How do I actually go about making a career path change into this, though? I have 5 YOE programming if you include my startups etc, 2 YOE as an employee at other companies. I'm also still doing my degree, but I struck gold on being able to work while I study, even if it makes my life a total hell in terms of scheduling.

But, beyond that, I'm really not sure about what further certs beyond OSCP and the basic IT set (A+, network+?)  are needed (or, which from that list are not needed?), whether my YOE in programming jobs will get me anywhere looking for netsec jobs, how to actually get a netsec job, etc

Company wants references from current employer... after I've accepted the offer?,"I just accepted an offer for a 75% raise, great benefits, etc etc. Ideal tech stack, sounds like the company puts a lot of effort and resources into solid engineering. Totally remote. Sweet. I'm as grateful as can be, but waiting for the catch.

I haven't put in my notice at my current job yet. Start date in 2022. I figure I'll just hang out until the dust settles from the other developer (of 4 total) leaving at the super small startup I work at and then put in my notice. Now the new job wants references, after I've accepted the offer, from my current/previous boss and a current/previous coworker, ASAP.

Why wasn't this part of the interview process? I can't give my boss from my last job - that specifically ended _because_ his issues with addiction were invading the workplace. I left with ample noticed, but that bridge is burned, for better or worse. I'm skeptical about giving my current boss, because in the year and a half I've worked here I've talked to him maybe 6 times, only 3 regarding performance and he never has any feedback to give. He's part time, seems to be late career and is doing this for fun. I don't think he'd be malicious, but the position the company is in, and given me leaving puts them in a hard spot, I don't fully trust he's going to give a shining review either. I don't have a clue what he'll say. I don't know what to do.

Anyone have experience with companies asking for this? Should I communicate this to the new job with his information? Or reach back several jobs ago (4+ years) to when I was fresh out of school?",1,1637040327,286,1560
"If a CS degree doesn't actually teach you to be a software developer, do you basically have to learn on your own on the side?","I guess I just feel a bit lost. I'm not currently in school, I'm currently taking a year off to figure out what I want to do but I'm considering eventually going into computer science. But from what I've heard you don't actually learn to code much or really the practical skills needed to be a software developer. I take it that if I were to just get a computer science degree, I wouldn't be able to get a job as a developer out of college. So how do you actually learn to do that? Am I supposed to self teach on the side while in college? If so, how do I even do that? I just feel like I don't know what the path forward is when it comes to education if I want a career in software development.

Need a second opinion: reputation as candidate,"So I recently joined the job market again after being employed/self-employed for almost a decade. About to start job hunting in Singapore. I chatted a bit with some people in a South-East Asian online discussion group not unlike this one. 

My initial take was just ""hey, I'm gonna just try to get as many interviews as I can, cast a wide net, see what happens"". I didn't think there was much wrong with this strategy other than being time consuming. However, I got a lot of people telling me not to do that as the employers are fickle and if you do bad in a few interviews, your reputation will ruin your chances at other places as well. How true is this in Singapore or any place for that matter?

I used to work at a FAANG and interviewed a LOT of candidates myself, I've never heard of such a thing although I didn't really see what happened to the rejected candidates in HR.

Can't imagine companies that get hundreds of candidates on a weekly or daily basis bother spreading ""reputation"" about candidates that couldn't do some leetcode easy questions.

I have a wife and a child on the way; we've decided together that we can't continue with the Army and want to settle down in San Diego to be near her family.

Goals (in order of priority):

* Be a present father and husband

* Live and work in San Diego

* Maximize income


Education/Test Scores/Certifications

* BS in Electrical Engineering (4.0 GPA) from West Point.

* GRE: 170Q/165V/5W

* FAA Commercial Pilot (Airplanes and Helicopters)


Experience:
6 years as an Army Aviation Officer flying AH-64D Apache helicopters. Multiple operations management and project management-equivalent positions. Combat experience.

I'm thinking the best route to accomplish my goals right now would be to apply for an M7 MBA program and then attempt to return to San Diego either as a management consultant (BCG, Deloitte, PwC, Accenture), as a product manager for tech/biotech (Qualcomm, Viasat, Intuit), or as a program manager for a large defense contractor (General Atomics, Lockheed, Northrop).

CS vs Data Science Major,"Hello. I am currently debating on whether I should do a CS or data science major. Right now, I am taking an intro CS and intro DS course at the same time. I’m currently on track for the DS major, but I’m not sure if I should commit. I don’t exactly know what I want to do in the future other than something in the CS/DS field. 

I’m struggling in my DS class compared to my peers due to most of them already having a lot of knowledge of python. I’m set to continue the class sequence for the rest of the year, but I’m not sure if I can handle it. I find the topics interesting but the programming difficult. The things that lean me toward this major are the fact that I tried really hard to get into the DS classes in the first place and the rewarding nature of DS jobs. But I also heard that job searching with data science is more difficult because you have to compete with masters/PhD students for most job listings. DS jobs  also seem to be hard because they’re more math heavy, which isn’t something I’m too interested in. 

On the flip side, I am doing well in my CS class because I am actually learning the fundamentals of programming, albeit in DrRacket, which is considered “useless.” Because of this, I find myself actually struggling less in this class than DS despite the fact that it’s expected to be harder because I actually have to problem solve. I also find it a little fun. However, future CS classes might be harder compared to future DS classes. I heard that it’s easier to get a job in CS compared to DS because it’s more generalized, although I’m not exactly sure what I want to be yet since I’m still fairly new to programming. I also heard that your GPA doesn’t matter as much and it’s more based on your personal projects. 

So it mostly boils down to how easy it is to get a job and which major’s GPA matters less during job search. I would appreciate feedback on whether some of the things I said are wrong and would be willing to clarify anything if needed. Thanks for the help",1,1637031179,380,2005

"If you are a socially anxious person, what could your boss say or do to work with you on your career goals and challenges?","I vouched for a person on another team, so they're coming to mine. I will be realistic - they can't speak up for themselves, don't complain when warranted, don't try to actively move menial tasks to automation or a team that can help with automation. I feel like I'm the only one trying.

I know that there is some social anxiety, and a solid level of discomfort talking to clients and presumably others in authority. I at least emphasize, but this is stifling their career growth, at this company or elsewhere. With the projects they were stuck with for the past year or so, the only reason I assume they hadn't quit is fear of interviews.

I want to approach this topic, and I'm not sure what to say without coming off as an asshole, but at the same time I don't want to downplay it. The lack of assertiveness is what explicitly stifled even just financial growth, I was told in no uncertain terms.

If you have dealt with this as a manager or as an employee, what helps frame this sort of conversation? That ultimately, I need them to at least aggressively outline their existing duties that are candidates for automation, and channel it through me. To speak up when there are obvious areas of improvement or excellent suggestions, which I know they have if I pull teeth. Can I recommend a mentor? A course? Just force some conversations with users and push through discomfort?

1.) am I too old to be jumping into this field? I was planning on doing a bootcamp (codesmith, etc). I’d hate to put in that effort and then find out that no one in their right mind would hire someone that’s 37-38 that’s a complete newbie with no portfolio

2.) what’s the job security like? Realistically, in my current role, I can find a job in most big cities for roughly the same amount of pay and you generally don’t get fired unless you’re incompetent. Will they fire me 5 years in because they can get someone younger for cheaper?

Thanks in advance to all of your input!",1,1637029807,225,1223

"Lack of ""Experienced"" developer","Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

I often see posts that there is a huge demand for experienced developers. Can someone explain to me what ""Experienced"" means? 

With covid and every one going online, my expectation is that the most desired skill is being able to write scalable systems to keep up with the online demand. Is this the skill set that employees are looking for in ""experienced"" developers, or is ""experienced"" just a broad term depending on the company?

* E.G a .NET shop would want someone with x years of experience in .NET framework and .NET core etc

Appreciate the responses!",1,1637028925,96,587
"Learning to deal with rejection, though my assessments were correct?","Sort of venting here. I made it to the 2nd round interview and did a coding assessment for a company here in the Bay area. Per the specs, I did it correctly, concisely, and exactly how they requested it to be done. I tested on my end and it precisely matched their needed output. I still got rejected the next day, with no reason given apart from “me not being a fit”. I kindly asked for possible feedback on where exactly I went wrong, but they’ve ghosted me.

I understand it’s ultimately their choice. I’ve had my share of rejections already, but this one stings a lot more because the location was perfect for me and it was a company in my dream industry.

art associates with coding bootcamp or engineering associates with film portfolio," 

I'm in my first semester in community college getting an associate's and transferring to a 4-year uni. I have a really strong passion for film vfx &amp; design which I have a portfolio with real-life work I did for small clothing businesses here and there. I want to do Computer Science not because I love it, but as a safety backup and for the salary. So I'm getting an engineering associate's and honestly, I really dislike the math classes and the prerequisites I have to take for the next 2 years when I can learn something I love.

First Comp Engi Job - Feeling a bit stressed,"Hey guys so I made a post a few months back about getting my first comp engineering job as a software developer. I just have a few issues which I need some advice.

So I been at this job for about \~2 months, and initially I was told it would be at the office but as soon as I got here, they had re-imposed working from home. Initially it was somewhat difficult to really understand what I was doing as I felt a bit isolated, although I did try to talk to my team through our group chat/ calls.

 I felt a bit down as it took me a few weeks to complete a ticket, since I kept reviewing it with my team mate, which they always seemed to want improvements. I do not mind but I guess I feel a bit slow compared to the others. I am currently doing another ticket, and most of my tasks have been just front end work, and I honestly don't really understand most of the other aspects of the project the team is working on. 

I also have an issue with working from home, as sometimes I just feel really unmotivated to begin working. Along with this issue, I feel a bit slow working and sometimes feel anxious in stand ups as I don't really have much progress done sometimes. I guess overall I don't feel like I know enough sometimes to keep up, plus working from home just makes me feel isolated from my teammates.

Has anyone had any issues like this? or tips to improve?",1,1637022843,263,1378
Worth pursuing down-leveled role @ G if higher TC? Factors to consider?,"I passed HC at Google to move onto team matching, but they approved me for a L4 rather than L5 which I was targeting.

I currently work for a large, established F500 tech company (not peers w/ FAANG, but maybe one notch below that—they're well known enough in tech) as a mid-level SWE, and will be promoted to a senior SWE in January as pt. of the mid-yr promo cycle.

Given then that it would be a title downgrade for me to work at Google as a L4, but it'll still likely be much higher TC than what I currently make or would make after getting promoted at my current job, how would you guys go about thinking about it? Is it worth it to continue the process w/ Google, and see how the numbers shake out, or would the down-leveling be a deal breaker for you?

I don't have any major gripes with my current job (just looking around b/c job market is hot), so I'm okay staying. I have decent confidence if I were to interview at Google later down the line: I interned there in college, I got a return offer when I graduated which I declined to work at my current company, and this time around I got very strong feedback for L4, so I don't worry about letting this go. At the same time, more TC is always great, and Google's known to be a pretty cushy place to work w/ excellent benefits and WLB, what's your take on it?",1,1637022764,252,1317

I feel like most people are looking for either fresh graduates, or people with 2 years of experience. But I'm stuck in the middle. Another part of my brain also tells me though that it shouldn't be that relevant and I should be hearing back more, so I must be doing something wrong.

Front end dev, 1 YOE

BOTH companies are offering me ~85-90k, HOWEVER.

Accenture is fully remote, and I would be getting a clearance and be a fullstack engineer.

As for why I'm not just applying to companies in those places: 
Trust me, I am. I am either getting rejection emails or hearing nothing back. It's a little disheartening, but I can probably attribute it to lack of experience (many of them wanting at least 2-3 years) or lack of experience with certain stacks.",1,1637012935,175,968

Comparing remote and in-person offers,"I'm currently a graduating senior in the robotics field who has accumulated about 6 job offers and am now looking to decide between them. Most of my offers are robotics start ups in the ATL area who offer the opportunity to work remote with competitive salary for the area (100k base + equity). At first, I was pretty content with working remotely in ATL, as I own a condo and the cost of living is fairly low, but I've recently been informed that I've passed the final interviews at Nvidia and that they're putting together an official job offer soon. The job will be based in Santa Clara and I will have to move there within a few months of accepting the offer.   


My question therefore is, how do you evaluate job offers in different locations? And how much would you value having a big name like Nvidia on your resume? I know I could research cost of living and make adjustments from there (about 60%), but there's still this component of having to move into an entire new area where I wouldn't know anyone. For some more context, I'm currently living with my GF and she expressed that she would be okay with moving to Santa Clara, however she's not graduating for another year so we'd have to go long distance in the meantime.  


I think I would be better off mentally taking the remote position but my heart is telling me to go to Nvidia. I did some research on NCG pay for NVidia and found it to be between 140-160k but I'm hoping to be able to leverage my competing offers and past experience to negotiate close to the 180k range. I'm currently scratching my head as to what the best option for me would be or how to weight these differences. I would love to hear any opinions!",1,1637011848,315,1688
"I quit my career to go to a bootcamp, and just started a full-time job. For anyone else trying to get into CS Careers, I believe in you! Here's my stats.","**Disclaimer:**  
This post is just meant to encourage people who are trying to get into a CS Career, either as a school grad or bootcamp grad, and are feeling discouraged.  I'll be sharing my experiences and stats through the job application process, and stuff I think could help.  

My point-of-view will be described from getting into Full Stack Web Development.  Feel free to AMA! 

**About Me:**

* I quit my job in March to totally switch up careers and go to a bootcamp, with hopes of getting a job ASAP.  My career before I quit was Executive Assistance, with 9 YoE, TC was $67.5k salary. 
* Though I have my AAS, it's from 2009 and I've literally \*never\* held a job in a CS field, nor had any formal Software Development schooling before this year.  At this point is more of a formality than anything I could lean on solidly, but I acknowledge it's benefit on paper. 
* I'm 33 y/o, live in Minnesota USA, and attended a local bootcamp program that started in late-March.  I graduated from it in mid-August and started a full-time job at the start of November.  
* Before this year, I had some some courses on Codecademy, and taken some intro coding lessons -- but that was it.  I could maybe tell you some HTML elements.  My school program was very fast paced, and by the end of it I had built two complete web apps from the ground up. 
* Current TC is $55k salary for a 3-month probationary period, then $60k salary after.  

**The Job Hunt:**

* Not going to lie, it was tough.  I would agree with the sentiment that the new grad/entry-level hiring field is saturated -- but take that with a grain of salt, as I see my school churn out new grads every two months. 
* I used huntr.co to track all applications, status, etc., so can confidently report these numbers to a good accuracy.  
* I applied to over 220 postings over the 2.5 month period before I received an offer.  Out of that, I had roughly 25 interviews (not counting initial phone screenings, only video meetings/etc.), and roughly 8 take-home assessments/challenges/etc.  There was probably 4-5 interview series where I made it to the final stages but wasn't selected.  
* Honestly, I'd consider the above stats a mid-to-fast timeline for recent grads.  I'm about in the middle of my graduating class to get employed -- I know people who've done it faster, and people who are still looking. 

**Things That Helped Me:**

* These are specific to me and my scenario, but wanted to share them anyways. 
* Part-time gig: My school links us with clients and one of the capstone graduation projects is building a live application for them in real-world use for their needs (for free).  After my team graduated, our client 'hired' us on as contractors to keep the app going and add new features.  I quote 'hired' because since we're fresh grads, we quote our work at dirt cheap prices, but it's a great resume builder.  Basically I can say I'm 'freelance team lead' since graduation, when it's actually only been like 50 hours of work over three months.  
* Part-time Gig: I also accepted a part-time gig (\~4 hours or less a week) in October doing contract Code Review for their current students code.  Again, a great resume builder.  
* Volunteer Work: I'm in a mentorship program with my school.  It's only one hour a night every other week, and it's cool to see how fresh students are doing.  Again, a great resume builder.
* I'm continuing to do all of the above in addition to my FTE. 

**Things I Know Very Well:**

* Web development &amp; Restful API's. 
* React/Redux/Saga, PostgreSQL, Material-UI, and GitHub.
* Documentation and written skills.  Helped my resume and portfolio stand out, IMO. 
* Relaxed and friendly teamwork. 

**Things I Wish I Knew Better (aka, Experience That Would've Helped the Job Hunt):**

* Object-oriented programming (TypeScript, C#, etc.). 
* All forms of testing (unit, integration, automated, etc.). 
* Cloud services (AWS, etc.). 

**My Advice To Other Junior/Entry-Level/New Grad Developers:**

* Find a way to make yourself different from the rest of your classmates, and fast!  IMO the best way to do that would be learning different/other in-demand tech stacks or languages, but it could very well be a good story for why you're here now too. 
* Keep your LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, and GitHub ***polished and in-sync!***  If you don't have each one of those things, I'd recommend building them out.  Every new application I built goes onto my Portfolio and GitHub profile.  All new experience goes onto my LinkedIn and resume.  Make sure your written skills convey what you want to! 
* Apply, apply, apply!  When you're fresh outta school, it's a numbers game.  Hit every posting on the job sites, but if it's a job you ***really want***, also go to the company's direct website and look at their careers page to apply there.  Hundreds of people hit the Indeed posting, but maybe only tens hit the careers page, so you'll have better odds. 
* Do small things that can help build your resume and portfolio.  Take small gigs, volunteer to mentor other grads, build small projects, just do whatever to show people you're out there learning and coding.  
* Lean on your alumni community!  Go to the meet-ups, network, and make friends who are in similar situations or careers.  It's now always *what* you know, but *who* you know that could be the deciding factor.  

**My Questions To More Experience Developers:**

* Since this is the Reddit hive mind, I'll take answers with a grain of salt, but I'm curious on the following: 
* Do you get annoyed with your companies tech stat, or rather, do you wish they'd use something you really like?  If so, how do you handle that? 

Of course, take everything I have to say with a grain of salt too.  Skills, luck, and determination will play a lot more into your search than my stories could.  Thanks for reading, and good luck!",1,1637011569,1055,5888

Ethical dilemma at work,"Hi,

A few months into my first software job (not counting the first one that I left after about 3-4 months).

We are an agency/consultancy and are creating some software which will be used by multiple clients. One client wants the feature to group multiple countries under one country code, and it has been implied this is in order to group Taiwan and China underneath China. This may be because one of the clients has a Chinese office, although they haven't named the client specifically.

Obviously I don't feel great about this, what should I do? I'm not massively educated on politics or anything but I understand this is a bit of a hot issue and I don't really feel comfortable being responsible for this feature.",1,1637011335,123,719

"Jobs for the more ""unmotivated"" devs out there","I do my best to stay off this subreddit and sites like Blind because I feel completely disconnected from the majority of developers here. 

Here's the thing -- I want to do everything I can to minimize the amount of time I have to spend stressed out staring at some bullshit on a screen from 9-5/5 days a week. It's crazy to me that we just accept this amount of work as the default considering how limited our lifespans really are.

I seriously want a simple life; get some remote land near the coast with access to decent surfing, have some dogs/cats, play video games, and make music.

Switching from finance to tech industry.,"Hello all,
I am a four year professional looking to change industries. I graduated with a BA in Finance in December 2017. I started in oil and gas sales out of college and when the pandemic hit, I switched over to the financial advising industry. I like this industry but I am not happy about the environment and career path. It’s going to take a while to build my book of business and start making serious money and also having to work a 9-5 for most of my life sounds miserable. I have seen people in the tech make a lot of money starting out along with some great benefits such as WFH. I want to make a switch as I see that tech is great place for someone young like me (28). I am thinking of teaching myself how to code or maybe taking classes. I wanted to ask if this is a good idea? Is coding worth learning and will I have a good chance of landing a job with no experience? I am also open to learning new career paths within the tech industry that don’t require you to go back to school. Any advice is welcomed when it comes to switching over to the tech industry. 

Thanks in advance for the advice.",1,1637008585,215,1107
How do I ask my boss if I'm training my replacement?,"Fairly large company, I got hired on a couple years ago as a Jr Linux SysAdmin.

My first real corporate gig and I experienced quite a big learning curve. My boss has been extraordinarily patient and I finally feel as though I'm coming up to speed two years later.

We recently on-boarded a new guy with some prior Linux experience as well as some AWS knowledge, since we're planning on moving from on prem to the cloud.

Now we already have a few others who are well versed in cloud infrastructure and I once again find myself struggling to catch up.

My annual reviews with my boss have gone well and this most recent one is no exception. I'm honest about where I feel I stand as far as my technical know-how and my boss has expressed that he agrees with this being my largest shortcoming but feels it will continue to improve. He also lauded my soft skills.

Have you ever introduced a new language to your team?,"My project at work now is at a point where I believe we need to introduce a new language to our stack.

I obviously want to integrate it as seamlessly as possible with the team (i.e. I don't want to recommend some very niche language) so I'm thinking of playing it safe with Java or even Kotlin, but I'd like to hear your opinions on this.

Unicorn vs Qualcomm Job Offer,"Hey everyone,

I have two job offers right now:

One is Qualcomm return offer:

\~100k base + 25k sign on + 10k relocation + 40k stock / yr (starting after 1st year) and 10k retention bonus if i stay at least 2 years. Qualcomm also gives a yearly bonus based on performance which would include cash and stocks granting over 4 years. This is in San Diego.

\~140k TC

The Unicorn is offering 140k base and 10% guarenteed yearly bonus and 5k relocation. This is after negotiation, I probably could have asked for more but the ship has sailed. They wouldn't budge on sign on bonus. They are also giving some stock options which I am not including as part of my evaluation because the options have a chance to be worthless. The unicorn is worth about 1.5-3B right now. They have gone through many rounds of funding and the lastest one raised a couple hundred million dollars so I think they are probably not too risky to be at.

If the company 2x'd then the options would be worth about 15k a year so it is not much. It is vesting over 4 years and they only give a refresher every 3 years right now. The startup is around the Mountain View Area.

\~154k TC 

Which looks better? San Diego has a cheaper cost of living, but I would be doing work on embedded systems which I think would pigeonhole me. My manager and techlead for Qualcomm was awesome though. I am also worried because Qualcomm has career slow growth which is based on YoE, whereas the startup seems like it provides much more growth. The guy interviewing me at the startup got two promotions in 3 years. At the startup, I would be doing work on distributed systems, ML/AI, and AWS, which I think is more interesting and would help me grow as an engineer more than sticking with Qualcomm. I think Qualcomm is worth more money, but I'm not sure if it would be the best choice career wise.",1,1637003717,335,1847
I feel like I was hired just to fix some CSS,"I work in my company for two years now. I got quite decent experience on both sides (frontend and backend) and so far I absolutely loved my job but wanted to find a new challenge after the last few projects.  Because of that, I applied to a different team at work - the job sounded exciting, interesting, with cool collaborations.

So from the very beginning, I knew that there was something wrong - engineers with who I spoke during interviews apparently weren't the ones with which I finished working. The HR recruiter who was taking care of my interview process told me that I basically don't deserve a higher salary and I am not that good, but they will still hire me in the new team.

I was a bit shocked, cause in the previous team I was getting very positive feedback, I won some hackathons outside work,  I had my own projects, I was mentoring other team members - overall I felt pretty confident. And when I was doing my interview, the engineers which been interviewing me seemed to be happy with me and my solutions (I think there was a problem with only one of the tasks). 

I decided to ignore that, cause I thought that moving to this new team will be great for my career.

I was utterly wrong. The role was advertised as a full-stack but in practice, it turned out that they just needed somebody to sort some CSS for them. My supervisor doesn't know anything about me and my experience, outside that I had some frontend knowledge. I decided to be optimistic, thinking that maybe over time I will be able to prove that I am more than that, but NO. 

It got even worst: one of the seniors is micromanaging me so I cannot even do more complex stuff, majority of my tickets are: fix heading, fix padding. I feel like I literally stopped progressing. When I got an opportunity to move to a different team, I wasn't allowed to do so. My days are basically 3 hours of work and the rest are pointless meetings that could be easily done via email.

There is lots of favouriting and huge egos. Every day after work I just want to lay down, read a book, go to the gym or spend time with friends. Being bored makes me tired. I see changes in how I perceive myself. I complain all the time, I feel tired all the time and dumb. If I speak up during some meetings, I am totally ignored, and often treated like I can hardly do whatever tasks I am doing now. One engineer acts like I cannot code, and the other one like I cannot read. I hate that.

I have a few options: try to go back to my previous team (although this does feel like a failure) or apply to a different company and hope for the best. For that, though I need time to prepare myself and lots of luck. I feel like a few months before I started in this new team, every week I was using a whole range of different skills - SQL, React, AWS, Node. Now I am just bored and usually doing the same mundane tasks every day, cause no one else is able and wants to finish them and I am not allowed to pick up different tickets.

 Should I wait and give it more time, should I change teams or find a new job? Am I overly dramatic by feeling so disappointed with the new team and responsibilities?

Any advices?",1,1637001887,597,3161
"Frustrated on being ghosted after a take-home project. How do I follow up on specific, tangible feedback as to why so I can learn and not waste my time in the future","**TL:DR:** went through 3 rounds of interviews over the course of a several weeks. All the feedback was very positive along the way, including the technicals. At the end they asked me to complete a take-home and got rejected. Not upset at the rejection so much as the fact that I wasted hours of my time for quite literally 0 feedback or explanation. How do I follow up to get actual tangible feedback so I can improve my coding?



I was reached out by a recruited from a pretty reputable company with a lot of positive things going for them. Was very excited going into it. Even though I was primarily an Angular developer, and this was a React role, they assured me that that wouldn't be an issue since I was currently learning the framework, and their legacy code was in Angular so it would actually be helpful.


I go through two 1-hour technicals with their senior devs and an hour with the CTO, and the feedback right after was very positive. They even said that as the next-steps, there would just need to be a follow-up culture fit interview and then the final decision. However, when they asked me to complete a take home assignment I was caught off guard a bit, but assumed that it came down to me and some other candidate and they needed a tie-breaker. I was hesitant to go through it because I was anticipating exactly this, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because I was excited about this company and wanted to stand out. 


It wasn't a difficult project at all, simple SPA using their API, make it searchable and filterable, etc using some specific React libraries and a very open ended deign requirement to ""showcase my artistic side"". Regardless of how simple though, it still took several hours to learn these libraries, come up with a logical UI and troubleshoot and test before sending it over. I hit all of their technical requirements.


I get an email back with very minimal feedback on the project (""We've all been there and you just need to fine-tune your code"") and a lot of fluff on offering to help me with my career progression/code review/advice and offering to contact me with future job openings. I was very cordial in my response, thanking them for their time and taking them up on their offer to receive the feedback since I am honestly trying to improve and figure out where I went wrong. Haven't heard back and it's been over a week. 


Honestly very discouraged to go through any more interviews that require take-homes even if it means passing up a great opportunity. How do I follow up again asking for tangible feedback without seeming desperate?",1,1637001277,460,2595

Has anyone ever used an existing offer to expedite the process at another company?," Hi all,

I just recently received an offer from company A, but since I've only been passively sending out my resume, I am not far in the interview process with any other company. I completed an OA from Company B 6 days ago and passed with 100% (it was on Codility so I was able to see my score). Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from the recruiter at company B yet.

The position at company B is much more attractive to me. Not only is the company more established, the role itself is a lot more interesting, and while Company A's offer is competitive, they are a pre-IPO startup and relatively unknown.

Would it be considered rude to use Company A's offer to nudge the recruiter from Company B? I realize that I am not even at the phone screen stage yet, having only completed an OA, so Company B might not even be considering my candidature at all.

I'm also half tempted to reject Company A's offer and keep looking, since I haven't even started actively applying yet and my current job is really comfortable (I'm looking to leave ASAP).

**TLDR:** An offer came extremely early in my job search process, but I'd still like to interview with better companies.

Am I about to be laid off?,"Going to try to be as vague as possible because I know some IT managers in the company use Reddit. I work as a full stack developer in a small team for a marketing company. Because it's a small team we're all stretched a bit thin. A few months ago our manager said that they were bringing on a consulting team to ""help us out"" with ""replatforming"" a lot of our e-commerce systems since we're stretched so thin and a lot of our systems have gotten outdated because nobody has time to update them. Everything has been fine until a few weeks ago when things have gotten a bit... strange. Our teams' manager suddenly stopped showing up to team meetings. We will send him emails and chat messages that will go ignored. The only time we will really talk to him is if he reaches out to us directly asking a question or to point out a maintenance-related issue. I did some digging and found out this ""consulting"" company also does outsourcing work.

I know our company isn't shy about outsourcing as they've already done this with some of our customer support staff. At the same time though my team really does support at lot of this company's digital platform across a lot of systems, and getting rid of all of us would be a pretty significant change. Obviously nobody is irreplaceable though...

Do I have a right to be paranoid here? Or is my manager just slacking with communication and I need to chill out?",1,1636997724,254,1403
How strict are experienced requirements in job applications?,"Most notablely, the years of experience. Most of the applications I see require 2+ years of experience.

I can’t ask my boss because they don’t know I’m quitting/looking for other jobs. I can ask professors but it’s been a while since I’ve seen them and I was never really a stand out student so I don’t think anyone would take time out of their day to write one for a student they probably forgot about.

Are These LinkedIn Scams?,"I recently updated my LinkedIn to include more computer science/technology content, and since then, I've noticed some trends in sketchy LinkedIn messages/connections requests I get. I'm looking for feedback to help determine whether these are scams or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some patterns I've noticed:

&amp;#x200B;

1) ""Let's collaborate on UpWork; I'll buy you a computer so I can remotely log in behind your firewall""

I've had several people contact me (or friends of mine) with a proposal to collaborate on UpWork. They then claim that since they're not based in the US, they need to have remote access to a computer in the US to work off of. They offer to buy a cheap computer and ship it to my address, which they will then remotely access. I'm 99.9% sure this is a scam; I'm assuming it's so they have someone's firewall to hide behind while they do off-book hacking. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

2) ""Technologist | Humanitarian Aid Expert | Aspiring Angel Investor | Coding Guru""

I've had connection requests from about a dozen accounts with some combination of the above in their tagline. The accounts are always the same: created in the past 2-3 months, all activity is them re-posting articles from Ars Technica, HackerNews, or other technology news websites. They're all female and have a similar generic school photo, 8-12 years of experience, and don't actually interact with anyone on LinkedIn. Seems sketchy, but they never try to message me so my best guess is perhaps it's some sort of Machine Learning experiment.

&amp;#x200B;

3) ""I'm an engineering manager and I need someone to interview clients while my engineers are busy""

Usually, the pitch is something along the lines of ""my engineers are all non-native English speakers, so I need someone to speak for them."" Sometimes, the request even mentions pretending to be another member of the team (""you'll pretend to be me for the interview"" or some such). Is this a scam intended to take advantage of me, or just a poorly thought-out business plan which involves being dishonest to potential clients?

Let me know your thoughts, or other interesting LinkedIn scams you've seen that are worth mentioning!",1,1636996252,350,2183
recruiter from staff company vs applying directly,"Hello,

I got contacted by a recruiter in linked in that works in a staff agency and wants to connect me with a company that I am quite interested in. Thing is, since he is not in the company itself, I wonder how is it different from me just applying directly by myself? Maybe because of his connections he can make sure my application is considered or something? As I already have pretty good creds (got contacted by a recruiter from google last moth and got an interview in a month) so maybe I could get that interview directly with less hassle? Is there anything I am missing? And also how do I know that staffing company isn't just a few random dudes essentially submitting my resume the same way I could myself?",1,1636996229,132,716

Negotiating an offer and asking for higher pay as a soon-to-be grad,"I am about to graduate this semester as a CpE. I have revived multiple offers from various companies in different roles (Embedded, Software, and Rotational programs).

The other offers I received will need me to relocate but the salary to cost of living ratio is a lot better.

Is it okay to ask the big4 consultancy company to match the salary of the other offers I received? Will they retract the offer if I do so?

Should I reach out to my boss about a task my coworker gave me that I am unsure of completing?,"Got a task to do Friday afternoon from a senior coworker but after couple hours of not knowing what to do and looking through documents for help, I decided to email the coworker and let him know I am not sure how to proceed with the task and that I think I was missing some additional documents or information.

"As a college sophomore, how hard exactly do I need to be working?","**TLDR: Just look at the bullet-pointed questions below**

Scrolling through this subreddit makes me really anxious, and it makes me feel like I'm not even doing the bare minimum to get a job after graduating. It doesn't help that I've also seen people on this sub who graduated from the same college I'm attending, and who have better resumes than me, who are having trouble getting a job. I think I need a sort of wake-up call on how much stuff I really need to be doing right now to measure myself accurately.

So far, I've mainly just been focusing on classes. I have a 4.0 right now, and I'm also pursuing a double major (statistics). I've completed a couple personal projects, but they're nothing compared to what other people make. I'm in 2 clubs, but they're more finance-related (kinda interested in quant...). I've barely done any Leetcode; I bought an online course this past summer that sort of prepares you for Leetcode, but I only did like 10% of it, and I haven't been working on it since classes started. I had a really jank unpaid internship in the summer too that didn't even involve much coding. I've applied to like 15 internships so far this semester, and I'm about to have my first interview tomorrow. 

I basically don't talk to literally anyone, so I have no idea how to gauge myself relative to other people in my class. I feel like I'm sort of living under a rock, completely oblivious to just how hard my competitors are working.

So, to all the fellow college students here, and also the grads who got jobs right after their 4th year, I would like to know the specifics of how hard you are working or did work throughout your undergrad. And by specifics, I mean ideally down to your daily schedule.

* How often exactly do you Leetcode? What year in college did you start doing it? How many hours did you do it everyday?
* How many personal projects did you complete in undergrad? Did you have some sort of schedule for how you completed them? Were you always working on one in your free time? Did you try to complete one project every month? How exactly did you organize your day to make room for personal projects? Did you treat it like homework and work a bit on it everyday after you finished studying for the day?
* How many internships did you apply to? What year in college and month did you start applying? How many apps did you send out every day? 
* How often did you take advantage of career resources? Did you attend every single career fair? How many versions of your resume or cover letter did you have, and how often did you get them checked by a college career advisor?

This post is too long, but I just really want a way to gauge how much stuff other people are doing / have done in a specific, measurable way.",1,1636992261,499,2756
Struggling Junior Java Developer (Back End),"I need honest advice from you guys. I graduated about 6 months ago and started this new job a month ago. For context, my biggest assets are on the Frontend but still decided to take this job because I didn’t wanna wait anymore after countless job applications. And I thought, maybe everything will go well and will get accustomed rapidly. But I was wrong, I’m mostly up all night trying to learn things fast and was also given a project, which I think I’m doing well but every time I meet with the lead, there is more to do and my approach seems to be a bit off. It’s really downing every time you go to your lead and unsure what he will say this time. Now I feel like I’m losing a bit on Front End skills now that I’m solely focused on the backend. I still wanna do frontend because I wanna deliver better results. I want to quit to focus more on what I’m better at and reapplying for jobs but I have no clue if that’s the right way to do things. I hate the embarrassment of not getting tasks done based on what is expected.

Having Trouble Communicating with Boss about CS Related Work Flow &amp; Procedures,"Be me, graduate from college with CS degree, interview for 6 months without a solid offer, finally find a start-up paying near minimum wage ($15/hour after tax), give-in and just take the position so I can get some work experience on the resume, be here for 6 months &amp; just absolutely miserable.

Basically, boss-man comes from a more hardware installation type work background, but decided to get into Wordpress Websites &amp; Application Development. His philosophy seems to suggest that development is linear, straight-forward path where if the project is estimated to be 10 steps long, all we have to do is complete 1 step a day for 10 days in order to finish the project. 

Meanwhile, he hired me (purposefully looking for young fresh-out-of-college talent because he knows we are cheaper &amp; more willing to explore newer technologies, yes he told me this himself).

Did I forget to mention, I'm the only software developer in this company that is only 3 people large?

So basically we don't have team meetings because there is no team, it's just me developing on technologies I've never used (not a big deal, but clearly there is a steep learning curve on your first time developing on Google's Flutter, Google Cloud Platform and AWS Amazon Web Services).

But its a startup, and hes just a dude with money &amp; a dream, so that's all fine and good. I understand the situation I accidentally, or not accidentally found myself in. So I sit here, get paid to learn new technologies and stuff the resume with work experience.

But the boss-man is constantly hounding me &amp; micromanaging me, asking if its done yet. I try to communicate these things: I'm a new college grad, yes I am learning these new technologies, no the pyramids weren't constructed overnight, my only resources are documentation, reddit &amp; stack overflow, I don't have another developer in the office to talk with, the office is lifeless &amp; crippling my creativity.

So basically boss-man is a big walking red-flag, but I got my work experience now, learned Cloud Technologies &amp; some application building full-stack skills. Hoping the hardest part is over &amp; I can find the courage to leave this place. 

Unfortunately for boss-man I'm the only developer here, so if I leave his projects unfinished, he is just completely fucked. I have plenty of comments in my code, it was all developed in a Git VCS, I've written  some 100 pages of documentation of the past 6 months. But I am not heartless, and still feel bad for wanting to abandon this project before completion, but I am just starting to fear this will ultimately sour my taste &amp; passion for CS. 

Even if this posts gets downvoted into oblivion or removed by mods, I am super proud of myself for coming this far. In the South East United States, by the way. So I know plenty of opportunity is ahead. Just need to stay optimistic &amp; grow as a developer.

Should I try and get a new job after only 6mo?,"I landed a decent job out of school that pays well as a Software Engineer.

"I am going to dropout college because of my job, am i doing wrong?","First of all i know this question asked like billon time in this subreddit, let me tell my story , my story is  little bit different than other stories.  
I live in Turkey and 21 years old i want to become computer engineer since like i was 3 years old. I do some freelancer works when i am in high school (i use the school computers for doing freelancer works and i made enough money for getting a laptop) I've never been good at school. Therefore I couldn't go to a good college.    


I study statistics and computer science at average college (shitty province that's how i getting accepted from a university and nobody wants study the statistics with computer science) when i was in college at first semester i focused my classes and got 3.6 GPA but it didn't make me feel good. my brain works pragmatic i don't like the theoretical very hard math especially mixed with statistics , the aim of this department is not to train computer engineers, their aim is train statisticians who can use computers.  I fell into depression when this reality hit me.   


I just wanna be engineer not the statistician i can't apply for ceng because of my shitty grades in high school and u have to work for university placement exam like 1 years, anyway during the pandemic our college turn to online.  


at this time i applied for jobs because i need the money for living (btw, youth unemployment is %30 in turkey)  a company liked my resume. and run a interview after the interview I got the job but start with low salary. and they worked with the kafka for data streaming to millions iot devices.  


 i make great optimizations on there and I delivered the works before the deadline. They liked me so much and so surprised to my work thus at the end of 3 months they give me %50 raise after 6 months another %50 raise and today my first year at the job and they gave another %50 too, everything is perfect I was able to go on vacation and buy what I wanted. (before the job my monthly income is just 60€)  


 but now there is a problem I can't go to college because I work (50+ hours at a week and sometimes up to 70+) so I have midterm exams in 1 week and I didn't even study for a day. It is impossible for me to finish this college while I am working because we are going through very difficult exams. on the other hand  my main goal is move to USA, without a degree i can't get any visa sponsorship from companies but if i decide the go to the college, I won't be happy and  gonna be penniless  


so, I am very confused. there doesn't seem to be a good choice here I don't know what to do,  do you think I should go back to the school I don't like despite everything, or should I continue with my job?   


:) Thanks for readers of my wall of text   


TL;DR: I live in Turkey (where the average salary is 300 euro)  I can't study to computer science because of my shitty grades in high school Therefore i study the statistics and computer science but i am not happy in there i have a great job now. but i can't finish my college because of  i work if i decide go to the college i can have degree after 2 years and i can use for move to the usa but  i am gonna be broke and unhappy.

CMV: Engineering is a better career path than HFT/Quant trader,"The question may sound weird and a bit out-of-the-blue, but please understand I am in no way trying to belittle anyone's career choice or just anyone at all. I just have some opinions that I thought I would get the community's thoughts on because I feel rather strongly about them, and for some reason lot of people don't hold these opinions which intrigues me and I want to understand their viewpoint.

So, I am a final year undergrad at tier 1 CS school graduating this year. As you know, for students intending to pursue a corporate career, the two primary options for CS graduates at this point are in engineering (classical) or, I feel more recently, in Quantitative Trading (HFTs small and big, IBs and others shops). It is no surprise that while both the careers pay handsomely well, quant/trading roles obviously pay much more (on average), sometimes disproportionately more if you land up in a big name HFT. I've heard people making over a million past 6-7 YOE in HFTs and retiring in their early 30s or less. Okay, that may be a exaggeration, or just nitpicking top performers and extrapolating, but even on average it is a given that quant roles pay way more than their engineering counterparts.

With that out of the way, I want to get to the main substance of my argument. Trading (algorithmic or otherwise), in short term, is a zero-sum game. Money is not getting generated, whatever you make out of your trades comes from someone else's pockets directly (precisely someone who you outsmarted with your trades). Well obviously it's not stealing, and I am not saying otherwise, the trade is voluntary but still my point stands - the money is not getting generated. There is no value being generated. Contrast this with classical engineering roles in which, as an engineer, you offer your services for betterment of someone and get paid in return for the services offered. This sounds like a more honest, or virtuous or whatever the right word may be kind of deal. My services can be misused, granted, but I still have the choice of whom I offer my service. I have many corporations to choose from and many viable domains/positions to select from which makes the task easier. In trading, however, there are no two ways about it, it's always a zero-sum no value generating deal.

Thus, I do not understand why would you want to willingly go for a trading role? Yes yes yes yes there's money, tons of it -- but typically if you are good enough to land a worthy quant role, you are also good enough to land a top engineering job. So it feels to me that the *extra* money that you net from a trading role, given that income has diminishing marginal returns, is not that attractive once you are already making shit tons of money as a high-demand engineer. Am I being naive here? Or just being too righteous with my shit?

LinkedIn data on the next tech hub,"I was researching potential cities to move to for my career, and I found this [article](https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/where-tech-workers-are-moving-new) published 11 months ago. It states that Madison, Cleveland, and Sacramento are the top cities for tech worker migration. The Bay area, NYC, and Boston had the biggest declines in tech worker Inflow/Outflow migration. LinkedIn apparently published an [updated version](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/austin-is-biggest-winner-from-tech-migration-linkedin-data-show) of these statistics 5 months ago. Instead of Inflow/Outflow ratio they use net inflow of tech workers per 10,000 LinkedIn users.

Is it normal that I'm so slow to produce code ?,"Hello !   


So I'm doubting hard about my skills and my intellect.   


I started to code when I was a kid about, 11/12 years. Started with Html, javascript, java. I built some basic website really fast at that time, around year 2000. Somehow I dropped from CS during my teenage. After failing everything at university and chilling for 5 years after that (as I'm really not a hardworking guy lol ) , I got back to IT as it's the only thing that is worth money I can do. I found a job in a big company as an IT, Linux server management, some scripting with Python. I kinda lied during the whole interview process about my knowledge as everything I was spitting out was stuff I learned in the couple of weeks before the itw.  
But it worked.  


After 1.5 year I left my job as I was bored as hell after 6 months. I get bored really fast.   
So I found a shitty job as an IT again with some dev in Java, SQL on an ERP.   
Anyway, worst job ever. I left after 1 year.  


After that I did a .NET training for a year in a center in my city. They provide very good training, I got a couple of microsoft certification but I hated .NET.  So in the meanwhile I learned basics of Python and Django ( did a couple of courses on Udemy ) .  


So after that I found a job as developer in a aerospace research center. My job was nothing related to aerospace, I was working on the internal tools. They provide master classes for the interns but also for the public. So my mission was to build this application with Django to sell to the public the master classes, register them, follow the billing process etc etc... So a webshop, with a event management system. The secretary had to update the site by themselves ( add the event, set the price, register the participants to the event etc etc ).  It was my first Django app ever ( except the one from the udemy course ). They knew I was a junior. It took me 7 months to do the entire app. I learned react at the same time as the frontend had to be dynamic.

It was not an easy case. I had to create different type of users, some coming from LDAP, others from registration by mail. Create all the webshop process, registration to the events, user panel to manage their profile, purchase followup, create the invoices, paiment reminder cronjobs, support all the paiment process possible ( paypal, credit card and others ) , invoice sent by mail, confirmation, notification to the accountant department and also a CMS so the secretary could update, modify everything. I did that all alone and they still use my app atm.   


So for the first time of my life I was not bored by a job and I was happy with what I was doing. But they were not. It took too much time for them, and there was some bugs ( honneslty minor bugs, and mainly on the administration side and not on the customer side ) . But I really did my best.   
So I got a second project to work on ( the dashboard of students / PHD on site for their exams, classes etc... Like the dashboard we have at university ). I was working alone again on this one.    
To be honnest I was so proud of this one. The UI was awesome, I applyed everything I knew from my last project and I was really proud of how it was going... But Again I was too slow for them.   
So at the end of the project they fired me. They still use my apps and outsourced my job. They pay some dude in Algeria (probably at -80% of my rates ) to maintain my apps.   


I went into depression after that and I felt like I would be rejected from any job. So I didn't even bother to search for a new one for 6 months. But I found on linkedin something interesting as they use Django and React ( I really love working with both ). After 3 interviews, I got the job. They read some of my code on project  I've done and technical screening.  I will start soon there.

But I'm scared AF to be too slow again and get fired. I know how things works but I lose time on stupids things sometimes or I have to look around on how to do "" that or that "" as I don't remember.   
Maybe I'm just too dumb for programming, I don't know...

How do you manage guys to work faster ? And is it normal that it took me so much time to produce those apps ?

Can a BA instead of a BS negatively affect your job prospects?,"I constantly hear that a BA vs BS in computer science doesn't make a difference. One sentiment that I do hear here often is that it depends on the curriculum of the program. One of the schools I will be applying to when I am done with the military is FIU which has a BA and BS in Computer Science. Straight from the school website it says:

""The BS in Computer Science (BS in CS) is heavy in math and science courses and the BA in Computer Science (BA in CS) is not. Some courses that are required for the BS in CS that are not required for the BA in CS is: Calculus1, Calculus 2, Physics with Calculus 1, Physics with Calculus 2 and Senior Project. Also, the BS in CS degree is accredited by ABET and the BA in CS degree is not.""

What caught my attention is that the only math pre-requisite that's required for the BA is PreCalculus, which would save me a lot of time. I find this path very attractive because of this. However, I do not want to shoot myself in the foot when it comes to applying to jobs after graduation. Also, the lighter workload would give me more time to work on projects and practice leetcode but I am willing to grind out the BS if it is the safer option when it comes to job prospects.",1,1636978796,234,1211

He knows I prefer React and Express over WP, and he promised me that I would be using React/Gatsby ""soon"".

Burnout or something else?,"I decided to post here in the hopes that someone has gone through something similar and has any good news for me. Is this burnout or something else?

So i'm going to start with where i currently am at the moment. I'm 33, mid-level engineer, working at a mid-sized company that i joined about 9 months ago. Unfortunately i had to start this role with a severe burnout caused by my toxic last role, and so as you can imagine, my superiors weren't exactly impressed with my work ethic, and i haven't really worked on any big projects or anything (unlike in my last roles), even though i do have some good wins from time to time, like studying a specific technology and improving or fixing something vital for our platform, etc. However overall, it is absolutely obvious that i'm not working to my full capacity, and if anything, i'm surprised i didn't get fired yet.

When i first started it was at its worst, and because it's remotely, i would literally not be able to sit in front of the laptop altogether, all i wanted to do was get some food, watch some TV and sleep, no hard thinking or anything, which took quite the toll on my journey with this company.

Now things are much much better! i think the main thing is that i persevered, and my boss cut me slack, without really understanding, i guess to him it just seems like a life crisis or something.

So now i'm generally able to work more, and i've also been studying on and off, but generally i've studied more Udemy courses than i did in the last 3 years combined, which is of course great, and some days i work so hard all day, but most days are still slow, and to this day some days no work gets done at all!!

I really want to close the gap and be able to ask for the senior promotion, which i know i can rightfully ask for as i've been doing this for 6 years, if only i could work hard and deliver consistently for just 2-3 months, then i can dare and utter those words in front of my manager, otherwise i'm screwed.

On most days what happens is i don't work for a few days, then i get so anxious about the lack of work i've been doing, and i go and just attack everything and finish it all in one day.

If only my boss could know that most projects don't really take me 2-3 weeks to complete, but only literally 2-3 days, instead he just doesn't take me seriously at all, which i can't really blame him for.

Here's what i've tried so far, i've been to therapy, did not help, but i will try a different one soon. I also tried reading some books, like ""The War of Art"" which was really great and changed how i think, but i'm still suffering.

What is the truth: Conflicting information regarding the benefits and ramifications of using a job recruiter (TEKsystems etc). Can they really take up to 40% of your salary and several other questions?,"Hi everyone,

I’m getting conflicting information online about recruiters and wanted to see if someone could offer some clarification before making a decision, I potentially regret. (For brevity, TEKSystems will be abbreviated TKS)   


Quick background: I have been a program manager in the defense industry for the last several years. I have helped build all kinds of hardware systems from radios to aerospace to weapon components. I have only worked in small privately owned companies in SoCal. For the most part I have been happy with my income which after about a decade in the industry has gotten to $95k. I have stayed at this salary for the last 4 years and our company owner, does not like to give raises. We have senior design engineers that are geniuses and one told me he has been at $110k for the last 10 years. Personally, I have not needed more to be happy and can cover all my expenses and save with this income. (Single, No Kids) As I have gotten older, recently turning 41, I have wanted to purchase a home of my own and stop renting and sort of keep up with my friends, most of which own homes. In addition to this, I have also had some hard conversations with my close friends (which work in varying jobs), and they average $150-250k per year which is making me feel a bit behind. I know comparison it toxic but putting that aside, I would also like to feel like I’m growing. (One of my friends first year as a Project Mgr at one of the large social media firms told me she makes $156k before her bonus. When I was a Project Mgr I was making $65k with my bonus. This really upset me, but that’s software vs hardware even though I managed multiple multimillion dollar projects as well). Getting back to it…    
 

A friend of mine that works at FBook told me I need to get out of hardware and into software because that is where the money is. This is obviously challenging when I have very limited experience in software (about 5 months on a small project). To help bridge this gap I just completed a 6-month Product Mgt course at a reputable university. After completing the certification, one of the course leaders, knowing I wanted to move to software, reached out and asked if I would be interested in a position they knew about. I responded absolutely, and they proceeded to connect me with a recruiter from TEKsystems (TKS). The recruiter emailed me a description of the job which included the name of the hiring company, and the hiring manager. The company is a defense contractor which has a contract with the government building a software system and the life of the contract is 3 years with possible extension. The job is for a Development Product Owner (Software). Because the companies I have worked at have been small, we have not used any type of application lifecycle management software like JIRA or Version One, etc. We also never used SCRUM or Scaled Agile Framworks (SAFe). These things are however posted on the job description. My only exposure to them has been in the course I completed.   

I checked the hiring company’s website, and the job is posted on there, however without the salary information. On the TKS website, they have the same job description with a salary posted ($50 to $55 per hour). A day before the meeting with the recruiter it dawned on me that someone I met at an event, worked for a recruiting firm. I proceeded to contact them to pick their brain, and he told me that I would do myself a huge disservice by utilizing the recruiter.   
 

**As an acquaintance he said, he was going to give me the inside scoop and said the following:**

1) If clients (job seekers) knew that we (recruiters) charge hiring companies $30 to $40 per hour on top of their salary and this is money they are potentially losing from their salary, they would never use us. (He hires for typically $100+ per hour employees for Salesforce).  
 2) My salary would be between 20-40% less if I were to apply through the recruiter &amp; benefits would be also likely affected  
 3) I have a smaller chance of being hired through them vs applying directly because there is already a premium on top of my head before even walking in the door  
 4) TKS will own me. He said, what he means by this is, his firm charges 500% annual salary if the hiring company wants to make me a permanent employee. He said most companies will not pay that amount, so you essentially stay TKS property, so to speak.  
 5) If I get hired at a lower salary say at $55 per hour vs $70 per hour, that $15 less per hour, is for 3 years. That means I will lose $31,200 per year for 3 years or close to $100k!!  
 6) I get lower raises because I get paid less  


**What he suggested I do:**

1) Cancel the meeting with the recruiter (which I already did, to give me time to think)  
 2) Apply directly to the company since I have the name and hiring manager’s name. He said since the recruiter does not have your C.V. they cannot try and claim credit on you  
 3) If you do not hear back from the company within a week, I can try to follow up and if nothing in a few days post that, can go back to the recruiter if I really want the job.  
 

**A friends mother was a recruiter for 30 years and I also spoke with her. She told me the following:**  
 1) It would be unethical to go around the recruiter since he provided me the job info (which included the company name and hiring managers name). I can see the point she makes; however, the recruiter would also not tell me I am going to be out 20-40% of potential wages for using them. I can absolutely see the value that a recruiter can bring such as coaching and simply getting you through the door. However, I do not agree if there is an ongoing fee beyond the first year and one that could potentially equate to close to $100k in income over a 3-year period. This is not to forget the possible lack of benefits etc. that might also follow.   
 2) She also stated that my salary would not be affected by the recruiter and that typically companies pay a flat recruitment fee or negotiate an annual fee for a set number of candidates. This is the opposite of what my acquaintance said that is also a recruiter vs her whom has been retired for 15years. When I google the average salary of a product owner in Los Angeles, it ranges from $50-$55 per hour so the job description on TKS site is close, but my friend at FB said some companies would pay $80 per hour for a POwner. He also told me that he was hired at a company for $60 per hour and came to accidently see in his file, he was on paper being paid $95 per hour. He used a recruiter.   
 3) She said that the recruiter would potentially negotiate a higher salary for me or help encourage me to get a higher salary because his commission is based on a higher salary, (but its capped on the TKS site).  
 4) If by chance the company were to find out that I went around the recruiter, that I would walk in the door seeming shady or slimy and that would stick with me and do me a disservice. I asked her wouldn’t the company be happy that I saved them the recruitment fee, especially if I end up accepting a lower offer than the fee they would have paid the recruiter? She stated they would not.   
 

Reading the job description if I had come across it personally, I would have never considered applying for it. I do not feel that I am qualified for it, however as the course leader is the one who said I would be able to function properly in the position (he is a senior technical product manager) I'm going on whim and trusting his opinion. I really want to get into software (especially something related to the metaverse or crypto lol). He also said the job description is a wish list and that I could learn it as I go. Part of me wants to utilize the recruiter because he may be able to get me into software where I might fail on my own. But that potentially comes at a huge loss in salary for 3 years or more. The other half of me wants to apply, myself, and see if I can get the job and negotiate a better salary. 

Thoughts would be immensely appreciated!",1,1636953749,1537,8075
"Can ""anyone"" actually become a good programmer?"," I went through a rabbit hole and found this post: 

http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2015/12/learn-to-code-its-harder-than-you-think.html?m=1

And honestly im concerned. Everyone preaches that you have to work super hard and eventually you'll get good however i wonder if its the same with cs. I have realized that cs is NOT just about writing code. Its about mathematically finding solutions in your head 

Comparing my  long programms with the very efficient  and short ones of my classmates makes me wonder if i'll ever get to think like one of them. You can read all programming books you want but at the end of the day your logic will remain unefficient , not enough , mediocre.

Im not the worst student in my class , i can solve problems sadly not elegantly. there's a small group of people that don't have the sligthest idea of  what it feels like to come up with the program in your head. One of them is so so bad that  he seems to not  grasp even the most basic notions of programming after having those being explained to him many many times (so everyone avoids him like the plague when working in teams)  and lemme tell you if i were in his shoes i'd be switching fast af out of cs.

I myself sometimes want to leave it all behind and go have fun with the folks in other departments and tbh im only sticking with cs for the technical skills to transition to ux/ui design  which includes my other passions and talents . 

So can you "" learn "" to be a great programmer or not?",1,1636952751,271,1485

I was always good at math throughout high school but this shit just makes zero sense to me now. And, having written several applications through coursework or as job interview take-home tests, I've never needed to calculate the derivative of an inverse function containing logarithms. To be honest, this crap is just a nuisance to me. I just want to learn code.

Few questions about AI and Machine Learning.,"I am an iOS Developer I am currently an intern. I like what I do but I believe that in 5 or 6 years Machine learning and AI are gonna be essential in any piece of software, They already kind of are since a lot of under the hood things are now using AI. I wanna start getting into ML and AI but I have some questions first,

A) What problems do they both solve? I understand the difference but I don’t understand why wouldn’t we just use ML. AI simulates human behavior and ML uses data to enhance itself and learn from past data. So why wouldn’t we just use ML if it’s constantly improving itself?

B) How to choose between the two? And do I have to learn AI first since ML is a subset from Ai?

C) Do I have to be ninja at Mathematics? I know it’s important and I am good at maths, I love it. Every roadmap I have seen has Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc. when do I say now I am good enough to start ML/AI track?

D) From your experience, is it possible to study ML/AI while working as an iOS Developer? I know that ML track is long so I can’t stop the track I’ve already started and landed a job after a year studying it to start another track from the beginning which is really long to get into. 

E) What other fields like ML, AI and Data Science that have big future?",1,1636949844,250,1282

Itching for more work...,"TLDR : 5 Months at my company and i NEED / WANT more work.

Not even sure if this is the correct spot to post this but i have a question, i am currently about 5 months into my first position as a full stack engineer at a fairly big company (1000+ employees) and i am ITCHING for more work. Is this something that is common amongst most people?


I get a 5 point / 8 point task and can normally get it done and tested within a couple days and in our case 8 points is a full 2 weeks. I then find myself staring at my test cases for the next 4 days. I get my code reviewed and normally have small changes but for the most part i am performing fine. Towards the end of the day my team logs off and i stay on to try and see if i can pick up another ticket. 

Maybe the stigma of working at larger companies and having 1 small task for a couple of days is true? I was thinking of grabbing a part time SWE job on the side as well to try and scratch my itch. Maybe i am so early in my career and this will ware off? 

I would switch jobs BUT because i dont have much experience it would be wayy to risky on leaving my current position for potentially short term fulfillment. 

I am at the point of starting my own company on the side so i can stay at my current position and have income coming in while i build my company.

Seeking advice for first job out of college decision,"Greetings,

I'm finishing my undergrad in December, I currently have two offers. Neither of them are my dream job, but they're what I've got.

Offer 1: a tech consulting company in Chicago. Starting pay is within 20% of six figures, no idea what the increase will be over time. Seemingly great culture and it's a 3 year development program where I will bounce around different teams. They specifically recommend no other endeavors like a Master's during these 3 years. Also I've been advised not to get into a serious relationship because statistically travel doesn't work for them. I don't really want to travel, but the contract requires willingness to travel 80-100%. 

Offer 2: rotational technology program with a financial services firm in Missouri. It's full time but I'm not quite a full-blown employee yet. Starting pay is a little over $60k and after a year they said I'll almost definitely be given an offer and a pay raise. They're also paying for some FINRA licensing and my interviewer said they paid for his MBA. Downsides are less money upfront and I think I'd like Chicago more.

Overall, I'm leaning toward the Missouri job strictly because of the travel. It's not that I'm unwilling, it's just the fear-of-the-unknown. I'm the kind of person who believes in structured free-time. I plan days, weeks, or months in advance. I don't want to have to fly to Topeka or some God-forsaken place every week for months at a time. But no one can guarantee me that's **not** what the job is. The Missouri job also has the perks of getting me into the financial sector, which I don't think is going anywhere soon... Cost of living is definitely a factor, but I think Chicago is the more interesting city, especially for tech anway. The consulting job definitely has the higher upper-bound in terms of cool projects I could get into (the company does have many big-name clients), but I'm sincerely opposed to living in a hotel for weeks on end. That being said, if it's truly what pays off in 3-5 years, then I'll do it with a smile on my face. I don't really plan on being with either company for more than 10 years... 

Last bit of info, I go to one of 3 biggest public schools in the US, I've got a 3.5GPA, and I completed two internships (one in industry, one in research). But none of this attracted the FAANGs or similar companies. So to all of you dear fellow programmers, I humnly ask for your guidance. Thanks.",1,1636945537,425,2424

UX Career Questions/Advice,"I'm looking to transition into a technology-based career and happened to come across UX design. I think it's something I may legitimately enjoy doing. What's the most effective way I can start learning about UX design and more importantly, actively use that knowledge? I know I can't ask anyone here for assurances, but I would appreciate any legitimate advice you can give me towards no-bullshit training into this field. I've checked out springboard, which may be the route I end up going, but that price tag makes me wary; I've come across several posts saying that their program isn't exactly the end-all-be-all it makes itself out to be. I can hardly afford to survive on the income I have now so shelling out my saving on something like this is a big deal (at least for me). Obviously, a solid introduction to this field is the most important first step for me to take, but I can't shake this feeling that I need to actually DO something in UX to see if I can make this work. How should I begin to take this path?  

If it matters, I already have a bachelor's degree in biochemistry, which I'm sure is better than not having a degree, but obviously not ideal.

Work gradually becomes unrelated to position and department. Thoughts?,"Hi there, I'm currently working as a backend swe with 1.5 YOE, my team is only 2 people. However, recently the work has become increasingly frontend focus. For example, creating a new page in the main website despite there is a front-end department in the company.

The company already has a front-end department (corporate) but somehow our PO and business team just  assign this kind of work for us. I don't mind learning new things but I don't like to work with frontend that much and don't have much experience so I applied for a backend role after I graduated. Right now I'm quite upset of what the work seems to be headed, as not only there is our own service to maintain, but we beed to do this kind of frontend work should the business team and PO want as well (which also has a tight deadline). Plus my manager doesn't seem to mind at all. This makes me kinda burnout since the beginning of the year and want to quit to rest and reskill because my interest is in backend, system, cloud and data engineering but not this kind of field that my team is heading to.

Confession: I think a lot of the devs at $company can’t program for toffee,"It’s not limited to the juniors, either.

I’ve got people calling themselves senior developers who are apparently unable to figure anything out unless exact prior art is handed to them on a plate. I’ve got people who respond to queries in code review by pulling you into a call and all but demanding you write their code for them. I’ve got people who flaunt putative “soft skills” and “project management” abilities who seem more interested in drawing up a convincing looking JIRA project than they are in actually figuring out a pathway to production.

This is my first time in a long while working at a large tech company and I’m *appalled*. Working in startups for the best part of a decade I’ve met some weirdos and some developers with serious personality problems, *sure*, but at least they could *program*. These guys seem absolutely allergic to any kind of technical problem solving. Anything that isn’t a piece of JSON plumbing that neatly fits into a three point ticket seems to inflict them with a kind of deep existential distress. They seem seriously upset at the idea of having to do something novel.

The reason we’re hiring so many people is to increase volume. The reason volume is so low is due to poor productivity. The reason productivity is poor is because of a stack of ancient PHP apps that cannot be run locally (nor their tests), where the dev cycle is largely based on pushing changes a few lines at a time to CI machines that take 20-30 minutes to spin up the required tests. It’s appalling, but management can’t get their heads around needing to sponsor a team that isn’t developing products directly, and find a different model for justifying costs to finance.

The juniors themselves are OK but largely unguided. I don’t see them making a lot of progress over time, they seem to slip into niches where they don’t need much support and work in largely unmentored, extremely inefficient ways. No one has time to support them as they’re all stressing out about their PHP changes taking months on end.

It’s absolutely crackers. I have never seen such waste. The company seems to totally undervalue software engineering as a discipline and allow people to reinvent the same wheels over and over because that’s the only thing that’s familiar to them.

I’d like to give my colleagues the benefit of the doubt and argue it’s all down to them being checked out emotionally… but it’s not. They’re actually pretty engaged. About doing everything really badly.

I feel like the senior developers at $company are all thrall to, Jesus, I don’t know, it’s like a collective cognitive impairment of some kind. The other day I was telling someone they could just store things into a relational database and join tables instead of using the crappy platform script YAML DSL to hammer it into DynamoDB and it’s like they just stopped functioning mid-call. I once mentioned to someone they wanted CDCs (consumer driven contracts) and they went on a rant that we shouldn’t use tech just because the Centre For Disease Control used it. This engineer is forty-six years old. I am dead fucking serious.

I don’t know what it is about these dweebs. I am starting to think there really is impostor syndrome in our industry, not people irrationally questioning their ability but rather people who go to work every day and convince themselves they’re doing an adequate job when they’re actually fucking daft.

And I’m sorry if this sounds elitist and gatekeeping. I have tried to be nice and bite my tongue. But I can’t do it any more. These people are lunatics. This company is a body shop. I think my colleagues are all demented.",1,1636935507,619,3633

I have to say that I had a non-negligible experience  with Python, its data structures, algorithms, OOP... And I think I have a good basis in mathematics that's used in Machine Learning. 

I have been interested in the question a while and tried to gather resources and it seems the 'best' to me are these books:
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop
- Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy
- The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani et Trevor Hastie

I believe these books cover Machine Learning in a rigorous way. Though I have no doubt I'll acquire profound knowledge studying these books, it'll take a long time before finishing them. I wonder if there are ways to acquire more experience while studying these books as ""side studies"". I have the opportunity to do a 6 months internship starting from January 2022 and I'd really like it to be in Machine Learning.

I thought about taking a data science MOOC on Udemy or so to get the basics of Machine Learning and start working with datasets on Kaggle or something as I'm studying the books above, but I wonder if this approach efficient. I wouldn't like to spend time on a MOOC just to find myself with shallow knowledge, having hard time to apply it to real-world scenarios.

I hope someone can enlighten me with its experience.

Thank you.",1,1636935299,252,1496
Getting into the information field without an IT degree,"I am a sophomore at my college pursuing a MIS undergraduate degree. The technical classes I will be taking are python, ETL, data analytics, SQL, database management systems, and business intelligence. Before I decide my major as MIS there are a few things I would like to know

1. If I decide in the future after I graduate with a MIS degree that it turns out I don't like working with data (Even though I do) can I do go work at another a different kind of tech industry? Some examples are web administrators, network administrator, applications, software developer, etc.",1,1636934171,99,572
Name and Shame: X by 2. Update after my post a month or so ago about my horrible experience after applying for them.,"This is an update and copy/ pasted from my old post. I’ve decided to name and shame them. I have also since found an amazing permanent wfh company with amazing benefits, culture that’s too good to be true, and salary that’s competitive for the area.

Here’s my old post with some edits for more clarification:

——————————————————————-


Basically, I applied to this small consulting company. They gave a hackerrank followed by a technical portion, a soft skill/technical and a final behavioral portion.

For my background, I graduated in April this year. I started college way back as a Biochemistry major and switched into CS. My course load was lower but in 2017 I fell into a depression and couldn't get much done. I took the classes again and passed but my family fell into financial trouble and the stress made me lower my course load while I worked. I couldn’t just say “I was depressed” but it’s insane they would drill me over this anyway.

Everything was going great and I thought, ""I've developed a lot over the years, I get along with everyone and am hard working, this should be easy."" The gaps can easily be explained with me taking time to focus on my mental health and slowly build up my career, which was true. After graduating I did focus a lot on my career stuff, and while I wasn’t hustling 24/7, my extra gap semester in college was basically work and job applications.

I was totally wrong. The first final portion was with the president and some manager who didn't even go in depth on my internship experience, they drilled me on all my gaps in college and why I was applying to jobs 5 months out of college. Sure, he wasn’t mean about it but he seemed emotionless like a machine drilling me about my past. He didn't seem to have any emotion in his face. I told him I was doing leetcode questions and brushing up on my technical skills here and there since graduation. I always planned on traveling but plans fell through as I thought about focusing on a job more. He asked where I went to highschool and if I was taking part-time college classes or if I was doing anything else on the other end.

The final portion after that was absolutely abyssmal. The manager has been working for the company straight out of college for 20 years and the company linkdin even mentions he has a family member working there. It started off well with a decent conversation but then he absolutely drilled into why it took me 6 years to finish college. I couldn't say I was fucking depressed so I told him I worked part-time and took a lower load after switching majors and taking on two minors out of personal interest and that my dad was switching careers. That seems like a lot right? Well I felt forced to answer it all basically. He was quiet with my answer until he asked me how I handled a stressful situation like that. He even asked me if my parents paid for college.

The absolute worst part was when he asked me why I took 5 months from graduation to start applying for jobs. I told him I wanted to relax for a month and started working on leetcode questions to brush up on my skills. If I didn't want to do questions for a day, I would research topics that I didn't know about. This led to about 90 questions completed and a decent understanding of programming. He told me (kind of respectfully) that it felt like gaming the system in a way to do these questions before hand because the questions asked by them are meant to actually test you. He alluded he wasn’t satisfied with the answer he had doesn’t understand why someone would want to take a gap after college. I told him that I wasn't trying to memorize them but to just understand different algorithms. He clearly doesn't know that the industry asks some of the hardest questions out there and that most candidates need to study them.

It's very clear this guy doesn't even know the industry as he's been on this job for 20 years and switched into management. He told me about this finance podcast he listens to and it just reminds me of toxic hustle culture crap even though I’m an economics minor who enjoys talking finance. I think he actually expected me to find a job immediately out of college and work day and night on job applications, while studying. He was keenly interested on all this despite me passing through all their technical questions with ease. **I'm sorry that I decided to take a more relaxing path to life while working hard on my skills in a reasonable manner.** Is he making assumptions about my class and lifestyle? That just because my parents can support me that I should have still begged to look for jobs instead of becoming a reasonably marketable interviewer?

I can't believe how much I was drilled. I nearly had a meltdown after closing the laptop because: I make friends easy, I work well with teams, and I'm a hard worker. It's clear I have passion and know a lot already and worked towards my goals. I have an internship, personal projects, and I do leetcode on the side. Why am I being judged. I'm just waiting on the rejection email, if they'll even send me that. It ended with a decent convo about his experience in the company when I asked about it.

I can't believe how normal the workers were and how mean this guy was. This guy barely asked me about my internships or projects just straight up about my life decisions and judged over them.

He didn’t even turn on his camera the whole time. Looking into the company they seem super unprofessional.

I got rejected the day after.",1,1636932994,985,5497
Having a mentor vs trailblazing,"I basically need help deciding whether to make the switch to a new challenge in my career. I had a really good mentor at my current role that left a while ago and since then I have been mostly the lead developer on my team. I only have 1.5 YOE while the other devs on my team have 10+ years. Despite this I am usually the one leading design decisions and also doing other tech lead-y type stuff like managing tech debt, mentoring other developers, working with product on decisions, etc. Although I love the challenge of taking on a larger leadership role, I feel like at this stage in my career it is probably still better to have a mentor that can help me with things only experience can teach.

**With my current role (F100 non-tech company)** 

* 108k base + 15% bonus (almost always guaranteed and typically a little more)
* very laid back WLB 
* work on a high-visibility project  (bonuses and promotions come easier)

**New Offer (Startup in Series C and tech focused)**

* 120k base + 6200 options
* was told it was very laid-back, fully remote
* interviewed with the team I would be on and loved everyone that I talked to and also found people that I could definitely learn a lot from.

I am still negotiating with the startup and honestly leaning towards joining, but I feel like I may also be missing out on a great opportunity at my current job along with the stability of it being a large company. After all, those options could mean nothing so I could be taking a pay hit by leaving. Despite the money concerns, the main thing I am concerned about is whether I will be growing faster/learning more if I took on a bigger leadership role and trailblazing by learning on my own or if its still better to have a more experienced mentor guiding me.",1,1636932600,318,1757

Advice for Lateral Career Move Away from Accounting (Audit),"Hello All,

I've been in accounting (audit) for about seven years (currently a manager) and feel like I've proven enough to myself in terms of job competence and the ability to work full-time in corporate America. I got off to a rocky start with my first company where another intern accused me of being a diversity hire in conjunction with not really understanding the work I was doing. This situation combined with needing to pay off student loans kept me in audit longer than I should have been. I've known since I started in audit that it wasn't for me, but I stayed for the check and to prove that I could do good work and be recognized in the form of promotions/accolades.

Now that my credit cards are paid off, student loans managed, above average savings/investments for my age etc., it's allowed me these past few months to take a step back and ask myself do I continue on this treadmill in an effort to keep up with the audit joneses or do I hard pivot out of this now that I'm more comfortable and secure in my skin?

So with the backstory out of the way, lately I've wanted to take an extended break at work and go all in on a coding bootcamp to segue into developer work. I've currently been attending a part-time coding bootcamp for the past few months and have done extremely well, the instructors have been impressed and I could probably get a junior dev role that pays half my current salary...and this is probably a better question for the coding sub-reddit, but unfortunately due to my job, I haven't been able to dedicate the time to working on personal coding projects for my portfolio or leetcode to prepare for interviews to set me up the best for whenever I start applying. I would like to take a form of sabbatical for 3-5 months to allow me to attend a full-time 9-5 coding bootcamp and that way I can immerse myself in that world.

The reason I'm posting here is because I don't know the best way to go about asking for this. I am completely fine if I don't get paid for the time I take off, so I was wondering if I could go to HR and request an extended unpaid absence? In my 7+ year career I've never taken off more then three weeks consecutively, plus I've lost some loved ones recently, and not to use their loss as a means to get what I want, but losing them has really made me rethink how I want my life to shape up over the next chapter. I was also considering picking up some contract work from an agency like Robert Half and only get booked for 20 hours of work a week -- that way I'm still taking in some money and my resume isn't gapped.

If anyone's made an abrupt career move out via a bootcamp (e.g., Hack Reactor) please let me know the process you took or advice you may have for me.",1,1636924861,510,2727

Mentoring Pre-juniors,"I'm defining a pre-junior as:

1. A developer currently working towards their CS degree, but has not completed it yet. This degree can be either Bachelors or Masters.
2. Pre-juniors are part-timers (20 hrs) with no benefits. This temporarily changes to full time (40 hrs) with no benefits during the summer months.
3. The pre-junior's time at the company will end when they graduate. The only exception is when they convert to FTE, which is extremely rare.
4. Master pre-juniors tend to last about 1 year. Bachelor pre-juniors can last the full four, though they tend to last around 2 years since keeping them around for 4 years means they enter as freshmen.

I'm looking for tips on how to mentor the pre-juniors so they can be productive for a decent amount of time before they leave. Problems I've encountered:

1. Bachelor pre-juniors, as you would expect, are objectively worse than new grads. If a 4 year pre-junior is hired, then they might not even know some of the basics, like how to set breakpoints in VS.
2. Master pre-juniors know the basics, but they are around for such a short time that their net productivity is rather small.
3. Both don't initially know the things you can really only get from experience, like estimating deadlines, code quality, and talking to customers. They understandably treat the work more like a school assignment.
4. No senior devs, except maybe myself, if you consider the dev team hierarchy. One actual FTE junior dev with benefits, except she also has to deal with school on the side. The rest are a legion of pre-juniors.
5. Pre-juniors are easy come easy go even if they do get hired. A few gave their 2 weeks notice when they only worked here 2 weeks.
6. The dev team took a major blow a few months ago when a bunch of devs graduated at the same time. There was some KT, but the knowledge was so massive, only the most important business-critical pieces could be moved, like the one involving our in-house time off system.
7. I realize this may be a cheap shot, but the junior FTE dev we hired, converted from pre-junior, had trouble with Fizzbuzz. I also had her do [this easy level leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/), which she also had trouble with. She said she never did Leetcode before.

On the flipside:

1. I'd say I have a decent reputation among the dev team. I treat them like how I would treat myself were I my own manager: 
   1. I give them tasks I want them to finish or at least progress on during the week and let them figure out the details.
   2. They tend to come back with questions throughout the week, which detracts from my IC work, but I rationalize that the question answering is part of what the company pays me for.
   3. As long as work gets done, I really do let the implementation of going from A to B up to them. This means I do not enforce in-office despite the company decree, and I otherwise let them do what they want. Code quality is handled during the PR later. One guy said he wanted to work remotely from India for a bit due to a family event, which I was okay with. Another guy said he had a job interview coming up which conflicted with a meeting, and gave me his meeting contribution to me ahead of time, which I was also okay with - his graduation was coming up soon anyway.
2. Their work output is actually okay from the customers' perspective when it is about 4 or so months before they leave, though their work can be a bit slow according to the customers. I don't really mind, since I've mentored a strong strategy into the pre-juniors for how to update the customers on progress.",1,1636924482,640,3607
Is work experience different from development experience,"On a multitude of job descriptions I've noted that some of them require ""work experience"" and some of them require ""development experience"". I assume work experience is time spent employed. Is development experience different from that?

Which engineering degree would make more sense for CS careers?,"I want to major in either computer engineering or electrical engineering but I’m having trouble deciding. I can’t do computer science due to the confusing math pre-reqs, co-reqs, and some classes only being available in a certain semester. This is due to me starting off at a precalculus level.

But I can do engineering and finish on time (for community college) and transfer to a uni.

The university that I’m looking at has nearly the same classes between electrical and computer engineering with just a couple different classes that are more relevant for each program. But I didn’t really see any CS related classes.

I heard electrical engineers still have to code and can get developer jobs but I’m not too sure. And that computer engineering can’t go into depth with either CS or EE since it’s 50% of either studies. But some say it’s not worth doing EE so I really am stuck on deciding.

I’m a freshman so I’m not 100% sure about these things so bear with me please.

A friend wants me to join his startup,"I'm not even sure how to write this so I'll just give a broad overview.

So I am a senior in college set on graduating this May. A few days, a friend (who is in the same college as me) approached me with a proposal to join a startup that he and some of his other friends are making. I already knew a little about the company beforehand but this was a formal proposition. 

As to what kind of services the company is gonna offer think of something similar to Indeed. They already have a prototype application working and demonstrated it to me. 

They proposed me a software engineering position in the company. Mind you, the company is not yet registered. 

Now as a senior set on graduating my mind is on the money. I am in the final rounds of interviewing with another company (actual company) and I have good feelings about it but my friend said that since everyone in this startup is still in school and it is still in the early phase then my work for the start-up can be a little side hustle. 

The startup is thinking of offering me early collateral (should the company not workout) and then some % of the total revenue once they ship the product.

Working at 2 companies simultaneously. Every day my salary melting away due to inflation. I'm extremely exhausted and I do suffer some health issues due to extreme stress at job. [Not in US],"Hey all. I'll try to be as much transparent as I can. Got nothing to lose but my both mental and physical health.

&amp;#x200B;

As of September 2020, I graduated from a university in Turkey. Just before graduation I had an internship at a local software company and same company hired me. We didn't sign any contract. I literally talked with boss on WhatsApp and took the job. I was asked to ""promise"" not the leave the company for 2 years. Salary wasn't bad, at least it was higher than the minimum wage. For context 37 percent of workers gets minimum wage, highest percentage in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in company knows .NET Framework and WebForms. Back in internship I was asked to do a project in .NET Core and Blazor because boss wants to do a project with newer technologies. After I got hired I didn't have much to do. So I was outsourced to my boss' friend's company. I wasn't asked anything. I just had an e-mail saying that X is your new boss now. It started as a normal job. They were using .NET Core and newer tech stack but I started to more than my job description. At first I was only responsible for backend but in time it evolved and right now I'm (was) leading two teams, developing entire backend services on my own, doing system design for two upcoming projects, deployments to test and prod servers, code reviews, refactoring, setting up new projects... I mean, it can be done, I guess(???) I'm just a new grad and I don't think it's reasonable to ask this much of responsibility from a single person. Only thing I have is enthusiasm about Computer Science in general and awareness of some things' existence. I read technical books etc. Although I'm not proficient in anything I'm just aware of things to avoid or things to do. We were 6-7 people and they started the leave the company because everyone found a better paid job. Now there are 2 people left in the development team (me and a frontend dev) excluding CTO. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm pretty occupied with my main job. However I still have responsibilities at my original company. The project  the boss wants to do? I'm responsible for that project because everyone else is working with older technologies, many of the devs are outsource to handle legacy code. No one heard of API, microservices etc. For few months no one called but from time to time I'm asked to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

Another subject is overtime. None of my overtimes are compensated. But if I forgot to log my working hours in a day, I get threatened with a cut from my paycheck. If I log my overtime, no one cares.

&amp;#x200B;

There are countless things I can write here. How I got dismissed because I'm not senior enough etc. Thanks to Turkish economy every day my salary shrinks in USD. Back in March I had a $540 per month net salary. Now it's 450. In January I'll get a raise but it will not be higher than 550 dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to improve myself outside of work hours. Been grinding leetcode for the last few months but one of the FAANG rejected me last Friday. Other companies in EU/NA aren't even calling to interviews because of either covid or they don't offer visa sponsorship. Every time I get a rejection all they're saying to me that, I'm not bad but it's not enough.

I do not know what do I do. This not a way to live. My hair getting white. There are wounds at the back of my head and my chest. Went to doctor and they told me to be less stressful ??

Advice on Landing a Job in NYC Within the Next Year,"I wanted to get some input from this subreddit about how I should go about things.

Some background: Currently, I’m working full time as a developer (my role has many hats, I’ve done server set up, MySQL stuff, Frontend Development, etc.) and will have about 1 year full time experience here when I plan to move to NYC next August. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelors in Interdisciplinary Studies at a State school in Florida, with concentrations in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a minor in business, which I’ll finish shortly before the move. I won’t get into it, but this is the degree I’m doing and don’t have the option to switch to CS or anything, with that said I have taken most of the CS core courses (Data Structures and Algorithms, OOP, Discrete Structures, etc). August 2022 is when we’ll be moving (my wife is attending med school there).

So my question is more for you guys that have already graduated and are working in the city or have before. With 9 months before I leave, how should I spend my free time preparing to land a decent software job in NYC?",1,1636916189,192,1086

Question on Negotiating as a New Grad,"If you had a good offer as a new grad in the area, would you still negotiate (especially as a new grad)? I've been to workshops at my college where they basically say always negotiate and that it's okay to because the recruiter expects it pretty much and it's harder to ask for these things later on, although I do not want to come across as pushy or greedy.

Taking a career break...,"Hi all!

I'm contemplating taking a career break for roughly 3 months, mainly to get out of a bad job, recover from burnout and spend some long overdue personal time with family.


I'm comfortable financially (12 months expenses saved)

I have no debts or dependencies and live a simple lifestyle.

I have 3-4 years professional experience with an in-demand tech stack (React / Typescript front end web) so feel I will be able to find work relatively easily.

The only thing that's holding me back from doing this is mainly the unknown and loss of stability...

Will tech start officially leaving the bay area for the other newer tech cities?,"Im not a developer, havent touched code in about 7 years since undergrad, but I have been following the career market since covid 19 hit, and prior. 

Having been from the bay area, I started getting frustrated with the doubling cost of living I saw between 2013-2016/2017. 

I have since relocated to Cleveland, Portland, Seattle, Fort Lauderdale, and now Houston/Austin. I have witnessed the real estate prices of all the above cities (except for Cleveland, I dont follow that one) spike astronomically within less than 2 years, however my townhome in Santa clara lags far behind.

In around 2018, ( was relocating to seattle at that time) I still saw a strong inclination of  new grads to head to the bay area, even though places like seattle offered comparable salaries, lower taxes, and lower cost of living.

Coding internship for non-student?,"Hi all, is there any internships or paid programs out there that will pay you to learn coding for non-students? I’ve been a Senior Financial Analyst for years and always wanted to become a software engineer / web developer but would always end up back in Finance roles. I don’t want to pursue data analytics (the logical transition with SQL and Python) because after all these years I am tired of having to analyze bad data, corrupted tables, and a minefield of failed implementation and tired of presenting decks and dashboard to management. I also don’t want to specialize in just Oracle or SAP that’s depressing. I would much rather help CREATE an app or a website and be challenged to learn and implement new technologies.

Here’s what I’ve figured out so far as far as my options:

1) self study something like a full stack web developer or even a single language such as Java and build out some projects and apply to entry level SE roles on my own HOWEVER there’s risk of stagnation and lack of motivation and structure doing it myself, I’m not a super disciplined person unless I know it’s the best course of action 

2) go to coding boot camp and take advantage of their employment services - there’s one near me that places grads regularly with good companies HOWEVER it’s tough to have a family and no income for 4 months unless, again, I know for a fact this is the best option and can convince the wife 

3) apply to a place like Revature which basically teaches you coding while paying you min wage and then shops you around to their clients where you work for them for peanuts for two years under contract 

Either of these options I’m will to do but there has to be some sort of paid coding internship or second career program with good companies somewhere that is a better option for someone like me with prior professional experience and a lot of motivation?",1,1636912825,335,1875

Should I keep my Data Science major?,"  

Hello! I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. I’m a college Jr, who is currently double majoring in history and data science. However, I’m considering dropping the data science major. I have had a few tech jobs outside of my coursework, and have some level of competence in web design, networking, troubleshooting/ computer maintenance, and I have a certification in cyber security. I’m hoping to go to law school/become a lawyer after college, potentially doing cyberlaw litigation or something similar. I don’t really see myself ever becoming a full-time data scientist. So, I’m considering dropping the major. I have a few reasons for doing so: 1. I really enjoy working with computers, but not particularly with data, I’m somewhat neutral on that front. 2. While my DS major is light on programming, I’ve never enjoyed nor done particularly well there. 3. As I’m going for law, I need to keep my GPA up, and DS will lead to more classes that I’d need to take, including some rather difficult ones. 4. My school has had difficulty retaining strong faculty in the department, and I’m more confident in the quality of my history education and even the experience with computers I have had outside of class. I don’t want to sound too negative about it though. I wonder if having the degree would set me apart, whether in law or just other jobs. Having data analysis as a “tool in my belt” has long been something that I wanted. I also wonder if having such a degree would be preferable on a resume, as history majors aren’t exactly known for their computer skills haha. I’m somewhat captivated by the potential of having the DS major.

So, here is what I really want to ask: How valuable will a DS BA (or potentially a minor instead) be for someone in my situation?",1,1636911240,311,1761

When should i start to apply to a new job?,"To give some context, i work at a big company and make about 84k. My job helped pay for my masters which i finished this past May. Since they gave me some reimbursements i have to stay for up to a year in the company or id have to pay back everything the company paid in the past year. If i quit now for example id have to pay about 11k back to them. If i quit in february id have to pay back about 6k. According to the fine print id only have to pay back what they spent in the previous 12 months before i quit. Id have to quit around May of 2022 to not pay anything back. But just in case lets say June of 2022.

So to my question, im interested in getting a new job. I think i can get 6 figures if i apply to a new job. I tried applying to a higher position in the company months ago but i have yet to hear anything and my manager does not want me to take the new position cause it would take me to a different department within the company. He offered me to work on some new development stuff.  theyre creating in the company but at the same pay. This is my first job out of college, its a nice start but im interested in other things now. 

Im considering applying to many other companies, including FAANG and Tesla. I know the process is long in FAANG and Tesla companies assuming i make it far. When should i start applying to other companies if i have a potential dtart date of June 2022?

"Software engineers with experience under 2 years(neither entry or senior level), how long did it take for you to get a new job offer?","Hi! I am a software engineer with 1.5 years experience. 

After spending a year on my team, I have absorbed the most skills and knowledge for what we are doing, hence I think it’s time to change and learn new things. 

I started applying and interviewing positions that do exactly different things than what I do now in the current company around 3 mo ago and got pretty far with 2 companies. But they all eventually chose other candidates stating that those candidates are more familiar/experienced with the skills they are looking for which I know how to use it’s just I don’t have the industry experience at.

Here’s my question, with experience under 2 years, I am obviously not an entry level or a senior level. I actually felt it was easier to get job offer back then when I didn’t have any experience. At least people don’t have expectations for entry level to have experience in certain things.

Second, my personal opinion is that a good developer doesn’t mean he or she knows every single language or have experience in all of them. The important thing is that he or she is able to understand the concepts and learn it by themselves quickly. However, I feel like at least the few companies I was interviewing in the past 3 months believe that a candidate that did have industry experience with that language is still more suitable. 

Obviously, I don’t want to stuck doing what I am doing forever in my career, but if companies are so obsessed with experience in certain things, how can I get a job in a new field without having experience in that field?",1,1636905851,278,1564

Recent ME Grad looking for advice,"Graduated 6 months ago with BSME, no co op or internship. Haven’t been able to find any job due to the combination of less entry level positions due to COVID, combined with no in person engineering experience. The few jobs that are opening for entry level are getting taken up by people with more experience. It’s gotten to the point that I am working at Amazon since they are paying well and desperate for help during the holiday season. I’m getting by fine for now but come January I don’t know how long I can stay at Amazon. Resume is full of extracurriculars and hobbies/skills such as coding and raspberrypi etc and hands on jobs working with tools/physical work. Covid also took a toll on things by making the last year or so of classes a joke since they were all online. Really lost on what to do.

Have been considering picking up CE/CS certificates and thus my ads all over my phone are for boot camps, certs, and back to school options.

After that, the person who was training us started a startup and i'm working there as a web developer (duh). Fast forward 2 months ago, i decided to go to a university to learn computer science but i really regret it because I suck at math and i already failed my first math exam and i can barely cover tuition because our economy has collapsed (forgot to mention i live in Lebanon) and our currency (LBP) has lost all its value, plus universities decided to increase tuition fees. The only reason i decided to go to uni was just so i can hopefully migrate to another country and you obviously can't do that without a degree.

The co-op will be mainly python and R based but I'm scared of what will happen if I'm not able to complete a task on time cause my coding skills aren't up to par. I've done a lot of python and R coding and love it but thats been mainly for my lab in which I'm not really given a deadline. The project manager loved the work I did creating bioinformatics pipelines so thats a reason I got the offer but what if I suck at the company? Im not scared of python or R but I am scared of my code never working and having to go through that java torture again.

Anyone have advice on how to overcome this fear? Im definitely going to go over python and R in detail this winter before the co-op but is there anything else I can do?",1,1636872413,240,1260
Senior Software Engineer of a different team keeps asking me for help on simple coding tasks,"For the context, there is this guy (let's call him John), 5-6 years of experience and a senior software engineer, and I am relatively junior, 2 years of experience, but because of my zeal for coding I know a lot of stuff as I have been coding for last 10-12 years. Anyway, I worked with John in a couple of projects and overall he is a since guy but completely stupid when it comes to programming. Throughout the timeframe of the project, he kept on asking me for my help on simple coding tasks or just debugging easy things like semicolon missing, for loops, array assignments, char sum with int etc. I know it sounds silly but it is true. I helped him a lot with his coding during the 2-3 months of projects timeline but since then I have switched projects.

Still, John keeps on pinging me that he needs help on such simple things. I have told him many times that he can simply Google the error messages because they are so common and the first result will definitely solve his problem. But instead of Googling, he will just pinging me or check my calendar and setup a meeting with me so that I can debug his code. There are a few days when I don't have any thing to do so I help him but sometimes it just annoys me completely. I would be working on my things and he would ping me saying he needs help and needs to submit this script ASAP. I tell him to Google it but he says please look at it as he can't Google it (what!?). I have told him many times that if I were in place I would Google it or just read a book on that language to clear my basics.

Also, when I am debugging his code on video calls, he would share his screen and ask me to read the code. I gets so fucking annoying to debug the code on video calls that I tell him to just send me the script and I will correct it in 2 mins but he never does because he thinks I will take away the credits. I mean, what credit will I take in correcting a for loop? It isn't that the company will give me a raise just because I debugged a simple for loop.

More so, recently he has started to ping me on weekends to solve his things. I have been ignoring his messages because its the weekends but then he calls or message me on WhatsApp. At this point, I am completely annoyed. I know I should help a fellow coworker but this guy is a senior engineer here and has been in this company for 3 years or so. And the things that he asks me for help are so simple that you can easily solve them if you know the language or you know how to Google. 

I want to get him off my back. What should I do?",1,1636871465,505,2546

Advice for breaking into the industry?,"Hey everyone, 

this might sound a bit stupid, but I was looking for some advice on how to land an internship in my position.

I have a degree in Graphic Design and have over 4 years of experience, but ultimately decided to switch careers to SWE due to some SWE friends convincing me (I also asked them for some help already, but the companies they work at either didn't have openings or were hiring for more senior positions). Took on a boot camp around the first quarter of 2020, and graduated in March 2021. Ever since, I've just been learning other languages and frameworks, while also applying to a bunch of entry-level jobs and internships, while also working full-time still as a designer. Ended up getting laid off a couple of months ago with my design gig, which gave me more time to keep searching for a job in the tech field. I do enjoy design still and so in my head, the clearer path for me at the moment is to search for more front-end positions. I'm definitely comfortable with your basic html/css/scss/vanilla js, and am currently in the process of learning as much as I can about React.

Out of maybe... 90 applications, I landed 2 interviews for internships, passed the technical portions, but did not get the gig because someone else just had a little more knowledge and fit the position better. one of the companies I interviewed with even stated in the rejection email that it was pretty much the CEO who chose someone else, even though the entire team preferred me.

Aside from those two interviews, I haven't gotten any luck. I'm not getting ghosted or ignored.. and some companies actually state that it's because they prefer someone ""pursuing a cs degree"", which is fine. a company can do what they want. I went into this career change knowing that it would definitely be difficult to break into the industry, but I didn't imagine just landing interviews to be this difficult. So I just wanted to see if any senior devs or people with a lot of experience have any advice for a newbie like me.

I'll leave a link to my GitHub if it helps to point out any flaws ([github.com/mikeemorales](https://github.com/mikeemorales)).

CS and Game Development,"Hi everyone, I'm 23 years old, from FL, USA, still in college and currently considering switching to a CS degree from my current Digital Media (Game Design) major. 

TL;DR: I'm not here to ask you what i should do with my life, but i want to know from you and your experiences, those of you who studied CS and work with game development, how useful was your degree to you getting a job and entering the industry? 

To give a little more detail, i want to make videogames but I'm not sure i want to work making games for a big company. I want to work on my own projects, eventually (hopefully) open my own studio where I have the creative freedom to develop the projects that I want to work on. I'm currently on track for game design, but from the research I've done it seems that thia degree won't actually help me get a job with game development, or anywhere else. I'm also worried about and considering i may need to get a job outside of the gaming industry for some time until I'm able to live off my own studio, and I'm not totally sure i want to do design, which is why I've been pivoting towards Computer Science, where supposedly I would learn the basic skills necessary to code/program the projects i have in mind, while also be able to get a decent job elsewhere until i manage to work out my personal goals. 

 I also frequently see people making posts talking about how they're self taught, or just did a boot camp or whatever and now they make a ton of money. So is a degree in CS really necessary or is just studying and practicing code on my own actually enough? I would still like to probably get the degree anyways, but to repeat the question i asked above, how much do you think CS goes together with game development, and if you've had experience with this, was your degree useful to you learning skills necessary for getting the job you wanted?

Thank you in advance for any advice or insight you may have!

Also I'm pretty sure this is the right place for this post but if I'm in the wrong place i apologize, please point me in the right direction.",1,1636861604,387,2068

How do I become a good software engineer? (career shifter),"I graduated with an avionics degree. But getting a job with a decent pay in the aviation industry is hard to get by locally or even getting a job can take awhile. so I went on and applied for different positions in the tech industry. I started with customer support positions on tech companies and jobs where I can apply the skills I learned (Mostly automotive). 

I do programming as a hobby and mostly self taught. Did some web app projects on my own then took a night school bootcamp and applied here and there. Luckily I got a position as a software developer in a local software company and enjoying it as Im learning allot from my seniors. 

But right now Im also being offerred the same position under R&amp;D in a multinational electronics company, although Im really excited about it, tbh imposter syndrome is hitting me hard because I might just get left behind and fired later on.

I am well aware that I lack allot of knowledge and areas since Im not a cs / IT graduate but I am more than willing to learn and spend time practicing. 

Id like to ask recommendations from the reddit community and co-career shifters what I should learn, approach I should take, or what areas I should focus on in order to stay relevant and be a good software engineer.

Career change from desktop app developer to backend web dev and the unavoidable job gap.,"Brief about me (skippable info, no need to read): 

Nearly 3 years experience. Lost previous desktop developer job due to being set up for failiure and backstabbed coincidentally before 3 year mark for 401K matching. Can't find desktop developer job at all, job opportunities are slim, yet there are many web developer job postings. I forgot all I used to know about data structures and algorithms because I did not use them at all for multiple years, so a job gap is inevitable (already a few months in).  Sample of professional experience : Python, C#, C++ 

Questions (don't skip this section):

1) Will I never be able to get a job due to job gap required to specialize in web development (even if it is logically justifiable)? 

2) Can focusing on learning a single backend Framework in Python (other than that wich is universally used HTML,CSS,JS) allow me to apply for jobs or fallback on freelancing in case of failiure (enterprise and freelance viability is my criteria for a ""safe"" technology stack to learn) ?  If not, what tech stack is better?

3) Is Language/Framework-agnostic programming commonplace for backend developer jobs despite the job posting suggesting otherwise?

4) Should I remove previous job from my resume if it is not web dev experience but rather desktop dev.",1,1636851128,216,1292
Questions related to majors and future career direction,"Hi guys, I am here to seek guidance on what would be the best move when it comes to pursuing a college education and career direction if I want to be in the tech field. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm about to finish my AA in Psychology, and it's time for me to transfer to a university. So these are my choices: 

 ♦  Go to UW and study business administration with a concentration on management information systems and graduate with a UW degree while working hard to keep my grades up. And then apply for a CS master's degree at UW. 

 ♦  Go to a good state school to do management information system, and then do CS master there or try applying to UW. 

 ♦  Change major at CC to computer science and then transfer to UW CS major or the state school. I know the Seattle campus is really competitive, so I could just try with Bothell or Tacoma. Another thing is, I'm not brilliant at math, but I'll definitely try my best to get good grades in classes. One downside of this is that it may take me longer to graduate. 

♦ Just keep coding and get good at JS, and see if I can get a job at some small company around here to just have some work experience. (Already self-learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and currently studying the intermediate level of JS.) Then later I can still go back to school for a CS degree. 

♦ Attend coding Bootcamp, although I'm not too sure about that since I don't know if there are good ones around here. Plus, it might be too expensive and not worth the cost anyways. 

When it comes to grades, I got 4.0 in every class I took so far. And I know to be in this field you need to constantly learn and be in front of the computer all day, I am absolutely fine with that. 

My ultimate goal is to basically work as a software engineer at a company that has branches in Europe and then see if I can work in one of those branches. Or I guess I can just apply to Scandinavian tech companies and see how that goes later on. And I definitely would love to learn the language in that country. 

Please give me some guidance on which choice is better, and show me if there are other directions I could take that I did not even think of. Or share your stories with us so that we can all learn something from your stories. 

I really appreciate your help!",1,1636850249,438,2261
I started my first job last month but my Salary is tied to my Visa status.,"Hi, I started my first Job as a developer last month with a salary of 64k / yr. For some context, I am an international student, graduated with a Master's in May, got a referral at the company for an internship 4 months ago. Internship was at a meager 1000/ month. And last month they offered me FTE at 64k. 

I was told that anyone who is employed during their OPT period (a visa status) would have a fixed designation and salary. HR told me that Salary and title renegotiations would occur once my Visa status changes to H1B. 

My main concern here is that regardless of my performance, my salary would be fixed for an unknown amount of time. Since H1b is a lottery based system, there is no guarantee that my application would be picked this year / next year / the year after that. And this would mean that I'd be on the same salary w no bonus and I'd have no say over it. 

That being said, this is my first job, I was barely getting any interviews so I am grateful for the opportunity. And the current salary more than meets my living expenses. Tbh I was able to manage at a 1000/mo salary albeit living frugally.

So I just thought I'd like to get to hear what other people think about my scenario. I like the work I'm doing, I have a good manager and I get to learn a lot but the uncertainty part of it keeps eating away at me.",1,1636850223,257,1334

Is This A Bad Offer?,"I'm graduating in December and applied to a random consulting company just to get some practice interviewing. I was contacted by them a few weeks after completing their technical interview and they gave me an offer for a 1 year contract at $60k with a stipend for relocation and pay for a brief training period, bringing the total to $72k for the year. 

The draw-backs are that if I quit or don't accept a contract I have to pay them $10k, and I have to relocate since the job is completely in-person. I also noticed some negative reviews and claims they prey on people who need sponsorship for a VISA (I'm from the U.S. so that doesn't apply to me). 

I was planning on rejecting the offer just because I'm planning on doing applications after this semester ends and I just started applying. I'm not sure if I'm being greedy though, this just doesn't feel like what I'm looking for, but I'm not sure if I'm in the position to make a call like that. 

I have a high GPA, a few internships, a decent github, and do LC questions in my spare time so I feel like I can probably get in at some other companies. However, I go to a really shitty liberal arts college and it's concerning because I'm just not sure how likely it is I will get other offers.

How does one change to different programming fields without tons of experience?,"Small background, graduated with a degree in Information Systems, got a job in a growing small business to help with their website.  First decade everything was great, but slowly the business has been making tons of cut backs and outsourcing all the web positions, I was the first and now I'm the last remaining, and now starting to feel the push out.  I'm being given a bunch of low effort tasks to do, while fighting with another hired (remote) dev over changes to the site.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm starting the job search, but... now I just feel DONE with web development. During my time there, the company needed some in-office applications, I volunteered, brushed up on my c#, and created a pretty well used app for them.  I enjoyed making that app so much more than anything I've been asked to put on the web, and always look forward to people needing more functionality from it.

&amp;#x200B;

So while I'm looking for a job, I just feel lost on where to go.

Serial procrastination leading to all nighters and health issues,"As a 27 year old I have, out of completely nowhere, developed an incredibly detrimental procrastination habit. I have had a remote job with a flexible schedule and a forgiving boss for over a year now. I can take time off pretty abruptly and even when I'm expected to work a certain amount of hours, it's by month and not week (so I can work 30 one week and 50 the next week instead of ""clocking in"" for example). The downside is I'm not paid as well as I could elsewhere, but I value the flexibility quite a lot, and the pay is still good. 

In the past 3-4 months, for whatever reason, I have been unable to even look at the work without getting exhausted. The idea of it turns me into a slug, mentally and physically, and I end up doing like 12 hours of work monday through friday. This leads to intense catch up on the weekend. Even up until Sunday afternoon, I may have like 30 hours of work to do and talk about in our meetings. This leads to staying up all night on Sunday to do some 17 hours of work, and then I just tell them I worked the 30 over the weekend. Then I try to make up the rest the next week. 

In the past month, I have been stopping the all nighters because it's fucking me up in a lot of ways and probably making me less focused too. I was starting to have issues digesting food well and that was the end of the all nighters for me. 

It's not just that I'm playing video games or doing something fun. It's that  would rather do anything other than start work. Any question on my mind drops work completely and needs to be researched. I would rather read shower curtain reviews than work. Even in a distraction free environment, it is very easy for me to procrastinate. This is really strange to me, because I wouldn't say the work has gotten less fulfilling. But my gut feeling is I'm so afraid of doing a bad job or being seen as a subpar programmer that I don't want to even start the work. This is a trait I have always associated with people either in bad work environments where they are punished for non-perfect solutions, or new programmers who never really learned its okay to fail (and programming often means tiny failures adding up to successes). 

This isn't really anything my boss is doing. He's really forgiving and wants to teach me things. And I have always liked breaking things in programming and learning how it all works, and I'm not afraid of errors or recognizing the code I wrote wasn't the best way to write it. So I am not sure why I suddenly feel this way. I suspect it's because I feel like I should be better at this by now, or the kind of work I'm doing has more ambiguous goals. Or that I have the idea of a promotion in mind and I'm worried I'll fail to get it. Maybe I just know I can get away with it subconsciously (although it makes me feel like a useless piece of shit and I miss learning things). I really don't know, but I clearly have had a big mental shift in how I view work and it's keeping me from wanting to even get started. 

It's also possible I am having bigger issues. I am not depressed in anyway, but I definitely used to be a person who would shoot out of bed as soon as I woke up, excited to read about something or play something. Now I linger in bed for at least an hour before I can even imagine getting up. I am wondering how this changed so suddenly (even when I had depression, I was a pretty proactive person, and I'm a lot better now). I used to work out more, and that could be another cause. 

Has anyone ever had sudden shifts in attitude like this? Is it just a part of getting older? Or is it a symptom of something deeper? I just want to be productive again.",1,1636845544,707,3652
Identifying lack of skill or imposter syndrome,"Hi, 

I have an issue that I’ve been trying to get around for some time now: I don’t know if I have imposter syndrome or if I am genuinely lacking some skills. 

I’ve been in development for about 16 years now. I’ve held many positions and worked my way up well. I’ve shipped lots of software and generally do it quite well… once I get my head in the game. 

The problem I have is visualising software as a whole. I sometimes find myself duplicating my own code in other areas because I’d forgotten i had already written it. I spend AGES thinking and over thinking and second guessing my design decisions. 

I also struggle with the basics of design patterns and principles. When I’m learning them I’m fine then when I use them in practice I spend ages wondering if it should have an interface or be in the infrastructure layer. 

I love programming, I’ve wanted to do it since I was 13. My college didn’t really do a course that interested me as they were so far behind. They were teaching me things I’d learned 3 years before. Not that I was so far ahead but the basics I knew. 

I decided to go off and learn it myself. The problem is that I think I’ve missed some fundamentals which allow ideas and principles to stick in my mind. 

When I come to planning a project out, I spend a crazy amount of time writing code then instantly refactoring. 

Like I say, I’ve delivered a lot and I’m happy with what I deliver in the end, it just takes me ages to get  there sometimes. 

I spend a lot of time developing by myself and can’t bounce ideas off people, I sometimes wonder if it’s that. 

Please can someone give me advice to whatever this is I am experiencing and potentials on how to fix it. I want to stop second guessing myself. 

I’m a contractor about to be paid out for a big project and I can afford to take a few months getting this on track as I just want to be passionate about programming again.

G vs Audible | I hate you G," 

Hi everyone,

First of all, thanks to this community for everything especially helping me create a better resume!

I  have seen all sorts of comparison between companies and wanted to know  about Audible vs G (think it might also help someone in the  future). I guess everyone here would prefer G over Audible. If I  had offers from Audible and G, I would pick G too. It was my  dream company for a long time. It probably still is, I don't know. I  prepared like crazy, reached out to about 20-30 recruiters and about 50  alumni on LinkedIn, to get an interview from G; but no luck.

I  joined Audible recently and received an OA from G. Guess what! I  am not even that excited about it. It took me 5 months after graduating  to land the job that I have now and don't want to go through the  interview process unless it's really worth going for. I know it's just  an OA but just curious about the pros and cons about picking one company  over another in the long run (assuming if someone has to make a  decision)

I would appreciate if experienced people in this field can share your thoughts on this.

What I love at Audible as an SDE-1

1. WLB  

   1. My teammates said that this team has one of the best WLB
   2. Even on-call is not that stressful
2. Compensation and Benefits  

   1. About 130 base
   2. 26 RSU
   3. $500/month rent reimbursement
   4. Hybrid work model  

      1. No minimum number of days to work from office
      2. I feel like this is one of the biggest pros
   5. I don't think sign-on bonus or relocation matters too much in the long run
3. Industry  

   1. I like entertainment-related industries
4. 10% employee discount on Amazon

Possible cons at G

1. I might give-up WLB. Many reviews on glassdoor say that WLB is not that great
2. Having to go to office
3. Nearly the same compensation
4. No rent reimbursement
5. only 5% employee discount on G

I feel like there's not too much room for innovation at Audible. Isn't this the biggest cons of picking Audible over G?",1,1636844567,399,2009

New work / previous pay stubs discrepancy,"I'm in the final round with a company (not a FAANG or anything but the comp is good and I really like them) and it's going well.

I had a shorter contract stint prior to this - 2 months or so. I didn't drop a prod db or anything and we parted on good terms, the company was doing a kind of re-org and a few people got the axe. In retrospect it was a bone-headed move not to include it on a resume but my logic was that I didn't want to have to explain over and over what happened there because it was such a short tenure.

Anyway, I just remembered that last time I landed a salaried position the background check included either a W2 or pay stubs - I don't quite remember which it was. I suppose they'd want to verify that I worked where I say I did. However, since there was a shorter contract at the end of the gig previous to that, I wonder if anyone in the know could comment on what that time discrepancy would look like in a background check.

I passed all the assessments with flying colors and the company is into it. I was submitted via a third party agency and the rate's been agreed upon. Is it standard practice for new employers to even require pay stubs or proof of previous employment? (and again, it's not like I didn't work where I said I did... just not quite as long)

How do they get validated, anyway? I'd rather not have any of previous agencies be contacted as they occasionally get pissy that I'm not looking for work through them.

Should have avoided all this but it is what it is. Curious to hear thoughts re: pay stubs / previous employment.",1,1636839543,298,1570

I just got my landed my first Software Developer job post-college! How do I plan out my career from here?,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions, 

I'm a Nigerian and recent computer science graduate. 

After sending out over a hundred applications, receiving dozens of rejections I'd finally got three offers and took up the offer from the company whose offer I liked the most.

I'll be working as a Back-End Developer on one or more SaaS products, my coding assessment was completed in Python/Django (I chose that) but I was informed that I will actually be writing in Java day-to-day. 

This is more than fine with me. 

I want to seek advice on how to prepare myself to get a good job outside of my country. I'm currently about to be enrolled in the country's Youth Service programme which is a year long and mandatory for all University graduates if you wish to work in the country. So ideally I'd want to use this year to gain work experience at the current company I was just hired at (starting on the 22nd), gain the necessary skills/knowledge required to be worth the trouble of employing by a foreign company and complete my youth service. 

 I wanted to ask to anybody here what sort of companies/resources I should be looking at to get myself hired abroad with a year plus to plan?

Is java as a back-end development language popular enough to land me a job abroad (Ideally Europe or Canada)? Do I need to ideally work on my front-end skills to be employable? 

What technologies/skills should I focus on learning outside my job that I'm about to start?

I'd **really** appreciate any advice people would be willing to give, I've attached an anonymized version of my CV below if it will help give any useful context and I'd be willing to answer any questions.

"Recently hired as a full-stack developer with only an associates degree. Currently on my first semester of my junior year at university, starting to wonder if it's worth continuing my university program or if my time off work would be better spent self-learning and save the $20k+","As the title suggests, I was hired as an intern immediately following my graduation from community college with an A.S. in CS. I was extremely humbled and glad to be finally doing work involving my passion, as I had done a lot of coding before school (and of hobby during). However, my internship was only contracted for 6 months, so at about the 3 month mark I started looking for another job/internship as I was afraid of going back to doing DoorDash and making less money, missing out on valuable coding experience. Imagine my surprise when after only 2-3 weeks of searching, I was offered $37/hr for a 6-month contract position as a fullstack engineer, and $70k/yr + benefits as a fulltime backend engineer for different companies. Even more shocking, when I told my current company I was going to accept the $70k/yr position, they extended an immediate hire offer for $65k and a better benefits package. I accepted to stay with the current company. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I have been enrolled in university full-time, first semester of my junior year and am finding the material extremely dull, and far too simple given prior experience and study. I am finding that not only do classes move slowly in terms of material to cover, but most of my courses over the next two years seem wholly unrelated to anything I will ever want, or need, to know or use. I am beginning to wonder if it would not just be wiser for me to save the $20k+ I would spend on university classes, and time invested, and invest that saved money and time into self-learning the tools and resources I know I will actually be using. I still have a passion for learning CS  -  mathematics, data structures &amp; algorithms, but don't see a point in learning the material for $1k/semester when I can learn it simply from the books that we would already be required to purchase anyway. In-fact, during my last summer break, this is exactly what I did. I studied maths over the summer, and am currently in a discrete maths course which has been an extreme let down, as a few weeks of reading a proofs writing book has covered more material than the entire 17 week class, at a cost of $20 (for the book) vs $1k\~ for the class.

&amp;#x200B;

Where to begin pursuing basic programming skills?,"Where to begin pursuing basic computer programming skills (goal focused on skills, NOT on earnings or career potential)?

This is such a broad question , I know. Please feel free to direct me to another sub if there’s one more appropriate. 

I don’t need a degree. At least, I don’t think I do. Budget is very flexible. Goal is to learn enough programming that I can *someday* help a company I believe in (e.g., philanthropy) once I have some experience that would actually be useful to them. My goal would be part-time or less (due to major health issues). I do not need to support myself with the resulting income. 

I have a bachelor’s degree and multiple master’s degrees (healthcare and business). I don’t need a high-level career here. I am in a position where I have a lot of physical constraints on what I can do, but a mental/emotional need to contribute to society. I want to see if this could be a viable option. 

If I want to do online learning, what are some good places to start investigating? Doing some Google searching, I’m rather overwhelmed. It’s very difficult to identify where to begin. I’m used to healthcare curricula - coursework builds on itself. I’m not sure that carries over to programming (please correct me if that’s wrong-headed). 

Should I just take a JavaScript course and see what I think? Python? Is there a certain kind of education program I should look at or just take things a la carte?

I’m envisioning learning a set of skills (budget for the education is pretty flexible), maybe a part-time entry level job somewhere to get some experience, and then once I have some experience work toward an ultimate goal of working part-time for a non-profit that I believe in. 

I’m just not sure how to start. I’m not going to be impulsive about this, lots of research ahead of me. Just kind of drowning in information on Google and not sure what sites to trust.  Any thoughts?",1,1636827403,336,1910

Should I renege?,"So a couple months ago I went through the interview process with a company and actually ended up with an offer.

How to quantitatively value startup equity when negotiating?,"I'm finally at the end of my job search and evaluating offers for staff engineer positions. (Numbers listed for SF Bay Area.)

I have one offer from a Salesforce subsidiary with about $230K base and $195K in bonus, stock, and other benefits. I have another offer from a Series C, $1B startup, also offering $230K base and... some amount of equity, which I have no idea how to value.

I really *like* the startup and would like to work with them, even if the total dollar amount is slightly less. They have a great team, great leadership, and better financial indicators than any other startup I've looked at closely. Normally, during negotiation I would like to say ""This other company is offering me $X. Would you be able to close the gap by offering $Y? If not, how far can you get?"" The problem is I have no idea how to put a reasonable number on $Y. Most advice I have for evaluating startup opportunities is more about how to evaluate an offer in isolation, but not how to compare it to a specific dollar alternative.

If I plug my offered RSUs and options and the startup's current valuation into a calculator and divide by 4 I get $120K a year, meaning I'd need $70K to cover the gap. But I have no idea if that is a reasonable way to evaluate startup equity. Among other things, about 30% of the equity offered is in options, which in this calculation would contribute almost nothing to the value. Also, startup values don't remain constant. In four years, the company will be worth $5B, or $0.\*

So I don't know if market value of shares is the right way to evaluate an equity offer. Certainly, I wouldn't evaluate a series A company that way, because the fair market value of Series A would be somewhere close to zero. At the same time, I would be very comfortable straightforwardly attaching a dollar amount to an equity package at a Series H company (e.g., Stripe). I don't know where series C falls in that spectrum.

So, how should I evaluate a startup's equity when crafting a negotiation narrative?",1,1636816410,359,2015
"Career change from VFX to IT, advice needed","Hi everyone, I'm considering a move from VFX to IT and was wondering if anyone could weigh in with their thoughts.   
For context, I studied game development at university and I currently work in Australia doing visual effects work. I'm not sure if anyone here knows what that entails, but some of the most important aspects (in my position) are:

* a low level understanding of data and data flow relating to computer graphics
* constantly keeping up with new technology and incorporating anything relevant into the pipeline
* Internal tool / plugin development 

At home, I've found that I really enjoy setting up home servers and have picked up a lot of Linux knowledge in the process. I have been experimenting with using my server as a node alongside AWS EC2 instances for a small, scalable home render farm. 

I'm starting to think that (even though I love my current line of work) what I'm doing now may not be right for me and I only got into it because I thought I had to do something creative. Though I am pretty decent at the creative side of things, I find myself enjoying the technical aspects the most. My concerns are mainly with job security and career progression. In Australia, the film industry is basically only being kept afloat by government tax breaks. Additionally, it's a small industry with not many available positions. There are no unions and pay is typically worse than other industries from what I can tell. In my current career path, I think I'd be lucky to hit $100k with 10 years work experience. Entry level was below $50k when I started. 

In terms of where I see myself end up if I did go down the IT route, I think I'd end up doing devops work. This is based on exploring the [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) , browsing a few related subreddits, and talking with a couple of friends currently working as sysadmins.

I guess what I'd like to know is:

* Does anyone here have any experience relevant to my situation?
* Anyone here from Australia that might be able to shed some light on the current job market?
* Any reasons why this is a terrible idea?
* Literally anything that could be interesting to hear!",1,1636813814,376,2156
I’m about to lose all interest,"Hi. I've been a computer science student for two years.  Last year we started with Python and then Java.  I couldn't pass the classes, so I'm taking them again this year.  The problem is;  I can't understand most of the topics. When I need to write codes using things I understand, I still can't.  I changed my study style, studied with a friend, looked at online courses, tried doing it over and over and made no progress.  Trying and failing for 2 years broke my motivation. There is no other college major I want, if there were I definitely wouldn't stay in computer science.  Being able to do nothing became more and more unbearable. I have lot of assignments, quizzes and exams to do, I'm getting more and more stressed.  Some of my friends say it's not suitable for me, some say that I need to work even harder.  I would be very happy if you write your suggestions.  Thank you for reading.",1,1636813770,173,895

"Considering moving to PM, need advice","I’m someone who’s always been pretty interested in the business side of tech and figured I could just use that interest to my advantage as a software engineer. But lately I’ve been thinking about going full PM. This partially came up because I’ve realized that while I love tech in general, which is why I became a SWE in the first place, I don’t know if I care about the deep technical implementations enough to push through and become an IC/senior eng or even an EM. Additionally, I think I’m a fine engineer but definitely not something special.

This leads me to PM. I feel like it would be a good fit based on everything I’ve looked up and from people I’ve spoken to. I honestly prefer to be busy and don’t mind meeting hoping if it’s productive too, I know those are some of the gripes people have with being a PM. I’d hope with a technical background I’d be able to also best voice the concerns of engineering too. Plus I’ve seen that generally PM make the same money  or within 5% less than SWEs and I've heard that they can often get promotions a little faster than SWEs as well.

Also as stupid as it sounds, I just feel like if I switch out of SWE, it’s like I’m “betraying” myself lol. But honestly my plan was never to stay a SWE forever, I always wanted to work towards management rather than stay an IC forever.

So with all of this, does it sound like switching to PM would be a good fit or would SWE still be the best fit and I just need to find a more business-aligned role?",1,1636813324,282,1492

"Need help, Just find out that I work in a toxic environment","I got my first job recently in april 2021 after completing my post-grad, &amp; I just found out that I am working in a toxic environment &amp; even the senior developers uses ad-hoc programming practices.

Examples of ad-hoc programming practices, 

1. They use excel sheets to create collection of apis &amp; not postman.

2. They don't use git to merge changes, instead they don't use git at all, junior devs/freshers do some changes &amp; send the following changes to the senior dev through skype &amp; senior dev paste it on his code, &amp; then deploy it. 

3. They don't use project mangement tools like AzureDevOps/Jira to assign bugs/features to developers.

4. Senior developer has used Jquery in angular, smh

Examples of toxic environment,

1. My friend was asked to work on saturday, so when 1st time her Project Manager(PM) tell this new to everyone in a scrum call, my friend asked a simple question whether she(&amp; rest of the employees as well) will get a paid leave or not. The PM yelled at her(sadly I don't have any proof). After the scrum she did a con call to me &amp; one other friend of ours &amp; she started crying on the phone. She might not be good in logics

2. I am also getting the vibes that my reporting manager is not nice but this is just an assumption maybe I am wrong as well. 

I am in the same company but I am not in her project, but in my previous 2 projects nothing like that has ever happened

"I have to provide my own peripherals plus benefits were a lie, how to proceed in new position","Hello,

I recently started a position as a data analyst and was really happy with the benefits I was offered. This is my first job in IT. 

These are the ""benefits"" :

- choice of mac or pc, plus any equipment I needed.
- top up card for transportation and food.
- 2 days home office.

These are all on their website plus it was literally offered by hr

I show up first day and I'm given an old dell with 3 seconds of battery autonomy and a non functioning keyboard.

I ask that I would like to use a mac, the comment is received with a very weird face from the office manager who provided the equipment: ""really? What for? It's the same"".

 She has to ""take my request"" with my manager and with some other people. I'm told that they will buy a new mac for my boss (latest airbook model) and I will be given the old mac from my boss.

I ask for a mouse and keyboard, was given a mouse bought straight from an ""everything for a dollar"" shop and an old keyboard. Mouse works like shit, keyboard was stolen by someone after a day. Both with 3 meters of useless cables 

I ask if I can get a mouse and a keyboard for the mac (the magic ones). I'm told that ""I'm already asking for too many things"". Was denied because my request was too expensive (one of my managers got a new msi straight from amazon in front of me, the other one got the airbook).

Cool I think to myself, at least the top up card will be useful, 40 euros for transportation or food is nice. Turns out it comes out straight from my salary. Every penny. So where's the benefit in that?

Also I'm told now that the idea is to stop working from home all together so I'm not even given anything (no screen, no chair, nothing for home).

Also the other analyst and myself have to share every account (looker account, supermetrics, everything, they only provide us with 1 account).

Are these guys pulling my leg or am I being too picky? Seeing my boss getting his new toy while I get his older model made me feel like crap to be honest, and I'm pretty pissed at him. Plus they made me feel like I'm pretentious for asking for a mouse and a keyboard? Why do they even mention the fact you can choose if they proceed like this? 

Not sure what to do, I'm super pissed at watching these young managers dining out for lobster all the time (literally) and constantly getting deliveries from amazon whilst if I ask for a working tool I'm told I'm already being too pushy with my requests?

Just wanted to know some insight from you guys

-create the specification
-break everything down into tasks and assign to the dev team
-check everything
-deploy to server, maintenance in aws
-sometimes I fix things that are hard to describe or just an interesting problem
-for a few months I did core implementation. I implementated a ridiculously complex authentication system.
-they are starting to get me doing estimations of competitor sites for clients, I'm terrible at this but it's probably something i could learn.

-From scratch implementation, copy paste edit
-create anything from scratch really, we have startkits and rely alot on docker.
-requirement definition with the customer.

Am I hurting myself by being role specific? By hurting I mean pay wise.

Here is my experience being self-taught compared with new graduates,"I have been in my position for a couple months now and have been able to compare myself to the new graduates that I am working with which I thought would be interesting to some here since that is a common topic of discussion. 

I have noticed that the new graduates have a broader knowledge of computer science concepts. This includes general programming, ssh, languages, syntax,  and a few other things. I have also noticed they have a better grasp on frontend rather than backend. 

However, my strengths have seemed to be that I have a deeper understanding on data structures, server side logic, fullstack programming in general, and the frameworks we are using which is mainly the MERN stack.

Some have had internships before but not a ton of experience. In general I am stronger on the companies tech stack since it is the tech that I focused on self teaching myself and have even been teaching them some stuff. But whatever advantage any of us have is quickly going away because we are all intellectually curious and are all learning quickly. Which I think is the main reason we were hired anyways. We are all expected to learn on the job. I think what having a degree mainly tells an employer is that that person has put in time and money into pursuing a developer career and is probably going to be eager to learn once they are in the position. I can understand that someone without a degree would be a bigger risk. Just my thoughts.

Lastly, this is a small to medium sized company and most graduates come from a regional university. I am sure the story would be different if I was at a big tech company.",1,1636776781,291,1614

I've learned that I don't necessarily enjoy low level coding. Where should I redirect my efforts?,"I wanted to get into software development because of how broad the industry is.  Also because of the pay, how fast the technology advances (which I find exciting) and how there's a creative aspect.  I imagined that if you wanted to work in X industry, there would be software dev jobs available.  Anyways, I'm studying for my Bachelor's in computer science and I'm really not enjoying sitting at my computer for 12-14 hours a day endlessly fudging with code.  It feels sweatshop-like (albeit while sitting on a comfy chair in an air conditioned office).  It requires too much focus, for too long, day in and day out, for a task that's quite monotonous.  I'm sure working an actual job would be quite different than school assignments, but I'm starting to think that I don't like working with low level code.  

What are some higher level areas I should look into?  What sorts of jobs would be faster pace and offer more variety than staring at code all day, every day?",1,1636772627,178,968
Tech Career as a Math Major. Some questions,"**A little background:**

Spent about 10 years in the military in Intelligence(TS/SCI w Poly) and now transitioning to the CS/Engineering field.

**Currently:**

A senior in undergrad in a school not known for STEM. Pure Mathematics(Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra) major with additional courses akin to Data structures &amp; Algo, Intro to Java, and general IT(Databases) courses. 

The only experience I have in developing are the beginner level Java programs. 

**Goal:**

Applying to &amp; and accepting Entry level Software Dev roles. 

**Question:**

Would I make a fair candidate to companies around the Northern Virginia area in entry-level dev/engineering positions with the current qualifications I possess right now given I do well in interviews 

or 

would applying for graduate CS programs(career transitional) afterwards be more beneficial in hopes to landing that first job.

First-year MSCS (2-year program) with little to no background in CS - Unsure of steps to take,"I'm currently in an MSCS program with very little background in Computer Science save for a 6-month boot camp on fundamentals + coding. I'm doing well in my classes, but I don't think that's enough to move forward in this career path.

My question is what should I be prioritizing in terms of building enough experience to apply for summer internships? (I'm planning on recruiting in the spring since I feel I'm not ready right now)

Should I try working on a project, or should I be doing a ton of leetcode? (probably both?) Are there certain programming languages that would be best to become expert in?

Right now my resume is almost completely devoid of tech-related experience (worked for a few years as a bond trader but decided that I wanted to do something beyond making money)

Also concerned that my age is going to be setting me back since i'm 5ish years out of undergrad.

Thoughts on SalesForce Approach?,"So I recently received an offer from a small startup that does tech consulting, specifically using salesforce. What I'd basically be doing is building apps on the Salesforce app exchange, learning about einstein analytics, and getting certification passes on Salesforce Trailheads.

I am thinking of using this internship as a stepping stone in order to apply to SalesForce as I would be very familiar with Salesforce already and may stand out as an applicant.

My questions are:

1. Do you guys agree with this idea? Would SalesForce be looking for developers that have experience developing apps on their app exchange? Or would this be something I wouldn't be doing in an internship?
2. If I am not able to land SalesForce, will these skills I picked up in developing apps in SalesForce app exchange be applicable to broader software development positions in other companies? Or will these technologies be too niche specific to SalesForce?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",1,1636772458,156,993

Re-applying after turning down an offer,"So about four months ago I received an offer from a FAANG rather unexpectedly. I was reached out to by a recruiter and took the offer to interview mostly for shits and giggles since I hadn't ever had a stereotypical interview with a big tech company and thought I should probably try for the experience. Well it went much better than expected and I got an offer. I really enjoy my position mostly due to my  work life balance, team, and the project I work on, so I wasn't looking to leave. However, the offer made it really hard to turn down. I let my manager know and she made it clear she wanted to keep me and gave me a solid counter offer with a promotion to a senior engineer. I ended up accepting the counter since I wanted to stay. That was about four months ago. Fast forward to this week I have been hearing a lot of rumors around the office of things going tits up for our program. Several people have unexpectedly quit and things are looking a bit dicey. I am not worried about being completely out of a job as my company likes me a lot and is super hard up for developers right now, so I think I can easily transfer internally. If it wasn't for the uniqueness of my current project I would have taken the other offer. Now I am sitting her a bit pissed since I turned down the other offer to stay and now my reasons for staying have been more or less blown away. Now I want to try and re-apply again to the same company, but don't know how to go about since I turned them down. When I turned them down I told them I was ecstatic about the offer, but after reflecting that it wasn't quite the right time to leave my current position so I feel like I left it on a good note. Should I just re-apply to the position and if so do I need to wait more time since it has been only four months? Should I reach out to the original recruiter?

Higher education with programming advice,"Hello all,

academic v/s personal projects," 

Hello, I am a sophomore pursuing computer science at one of the top 50 schools. All my life, I have given a lot of weightage to academics. In my first year I have had 97%, and on the track to get the same in my second year. I was just making my resume for trying to get a summer internship. And, not shockingly, I have nothing to write except some awards and my GPA. Past few days, I have decided to also do something extra like learning android development, but I get no time to even fucking start at the end of the day. I am really tense right now and confused. I cant get what I want.

Do you think I should trade off my (almost) perfect score to learn something else, like android or web development? I know this might sound weird, but I am genuinely confused.

Also, I feel I'm more of a product person than an engineer. Though I'm not a bad engineer. (I've received multiple offers from different firms  for the role of SWE). Another thing to note. I'm in mid 20s and I don't have time, I need to rush.

I need your advice, please tell me what you guys feel",1,1636754469,234,1237

How to properly leverage an offer from one company to increase another,"I'm in the position where I've been offered 85k at a company, said (verbally) that that number works great for me. I also potentially have offers from two other companies coming in, and if those are at or above the same salary, what do I do?

Is it weird to go back to the company I got the first offer from (and verbally said yes that number is good), and to say something like ""i got an offer from another company that is very competitive, if the salary here was a bit higher (e.g. 88k), I would take it.""

Any advice appreciated",1,1636753951,100,531
Feel like my performance dipped by some distance,"My cs career has been very short, (less than a year) but I have always felt like I have performed quite competently when it comes to my role, fixing bugs and contributing to new requirements etc. 

Recently I took a long-ish (2 weeks) PTO where I didn't touch my work pc/didn't write a line of code. Ever since I came back, I have been feeling as if I have lost my speed by a huge margin. Its taking me entire weeks for issues that would usually take a couple of days. I am not able to debug things as quickly, the solution I come up with is plain stupid (logically and syntactically). More often than not it looks like I am coming up with the worst possible solution to a problem. There is a general friction in my flow of thoughts and I can't find a cause why. I don't feel burnt out, I still wake up looking forward to the next day, but this feeling of anxiousness is going stronger as each day passes.

UK Placement Student - Next Steps ...,"Hi Everyone,

Quick bit of context, I am currently on a placement (9 Month Internship), working in Cyber as an Analyst in the public sector. I'm yet to finish my degree, so I have no need to make any decisions just yet.

So far I really love the experience, but would like to potentially move in to an area where I may be able to use my programming skills a bit more (Python, C++ etc). I have realised Pen Testing (HTB, THM) may not align with my interests &amp; skills, and I am wondering how I may be able to move my career towards a blend of Cyber (mainly) with some (more than current) programming involved, quite regularly. I appreciate that this may not be something I can do straight out of University, however I am just looking for some ideas about how I may go about achieving what I want, as I gain some experience.

Overall, though I would just like an interesting, fulfilling career path, that's going to make me use brain. (also, I much prefer Cyber working culture over that of SWEs, so that's a no go at the moment)

How much C++ do I need to know for internship?,"I am currently in school for math and I am learning C++ on my own. I started in September 2021. My goal is to get an internship. I have looked at [https://www.learncpp.com/](https://www.learncpp.com/) and skimming through C++ Primer (Stanley Lippman). After the overview, I'm slowly working through The C++ Programming Language (Bjarne Stroustrup) and working on all the exercises. Concurrently, I'm working on LeetCode questions to apply the concepts as I learn them.

My questions are: What level of proficiency is needed for me to be able to get an internship? i.e. suppose I finish and understand all the exercises in The C++ Programming Language, is that sufficient? Would I need to have projects on GitHub? What would be on a checklist of necessary things for me to know before applying?

Pursue internship in ML or SWE position,I just finished my MS in CS focusing on AI/ML and am finding from my job search that not having experience or a phd makes it tough to get my foot in the door. I've been applying for any position related to DS/ML I can find but have started opening up to the ideas of applying to ML internships to get that experience or applying to regular SWE positions at big companies in my area with the hopes of finding the potential to switch teams internally despite gaining what will be non-ml experience.

"I don't Java, should I take the job?","I am a 22 y/o student, last year on my Data Science Bachelor Degree, who needs advice from anyone at the moment, as I feel like this might be some kind of turning point in my life/young adult life. Please hear me out. Some of the stuff I wrote might sound dumb, but please hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no experience or knowledge with programming before I started at Uni. I got introduced to Python. It was difficult at the begginning but within a year, I fell in love with it. The summer before my second year started, I got interrested in Javascript, mainly because of React js. I made some projects both small and large using React js only (FE). From there on, even tho my degree is going to be in Data Science, I only worked on software projects, both FE(React js) and BE (Express, Typescript / Node js). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, now that I briefly explained what I like, its time to bring up the actual ""problem"". As I mentioned, Data Science Bachelor is the degree I am getting next year. But Software is what I like. I had planned to work within software before I work in Data Science. That hasnt changed.

&amp;#x200B;

I meet a full stack developer through a friend, and we connected fast. We also worked with a project together for half a year, where he was the BE guy and me in FE. So he knows that React js or Javascript generally is what I like working with. Anyways, I told him that it was maybe time for me to start searching for job as software developer. So he (as my friend and a mentor) recomended me to the company (international company) he works for. He spent quite a time trying to get me the job, as there were quite a bit of paper work he had to do. A week ago, he called me and told me that they were interrrested and that he could get me an interview for the job as Junior Full Stack Developer. He also mentioned that their department (in this country) does not usually work with FE, but mosly backend, which is in Java. Even tho Java sounded scary, I was optimistic. For the past 5-7 days, I have been trying to understand Java Spring. I must say, that I hate it! It really does not make any sense compared to building a backend using Node js, Typescript, Express. Java Spring is total chaos, and I have been very unmotivated/stressed/scared of taking the job. Even tho he told me that they do not expect much from Junior delevoper, I still can not stop thinking about wether this is a right decision or not. I am the type of guy who is not afraid of most of the things, BUT, I am afraid of saying NO, especially to those who are nice/have given me opportunities. I just cant say NO. I am scared that I never will like the language Java, and therefore hate the job, and generally unmotivated to work within programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this might be a good opportunity for me, and some part of me is saying that I just need to dive in and see what happens. Worst case scenario is that I have to quit that job and search for another. But I am also afraid that my mentor will think that I wasted lot of his time and effort to get me in there. This is my first tech job so I have no idea what I am getting myself into either.

&amp;#x200B;

"CS degree and 2 years experience, but on a 3 year gap. Should I go back for a bootcamp?","I have a CS degree and a few years of work experience as a junior developer, but am currently on a 3-year gap from software jobs.   I'm wondering how to get back into the field.  

Is a bootcamp a good idea?  I was thinking about joining Tech Elevator to boost my skills and portfolio up and get the connections and interview practice needed to bridge back into the industry. 

I can financially afford the bootcamp just fine and have a place to stay which is low-cost, so would not need to be there employed (parents).  Also, I have trouble with self-studying and would be eager to participate and bolster my resume and portfolio, something I've always wanted to do.

Depressed and can't do my job anymore. Do I talk to my job about my mental state?,"Hey all, before I get any thing saying I should be posting this somewhere different, I'd like to preface this by saying I already have started seeking therapist and mental health help. This is solely me asking about what would be the best way to approach this situation from a career-wise perspective, hence why I'm here asking about my particular situation.

--------

- So I'm a brand new developer straight out of college with a Computer Engineering degree, in a fairly large company that started late July 2021.

- My team is based entirely out of India, except me. 
- I have never done any web development in my life, but wanted to try it, so I asked for that kind of work in my team-selection process and this is where they put me. I understand I asked for this, but I feel that've put a lot of responsibility on me. 

- They basically have tasked me with basically becoming the main developer for a web-application that two interns wrote this past summer.

- Throughout all this, I've made big life changes, having moved into the city on my own, dealing with ADHD, relationship issues, and having dealt with depression for almost a year. 

- **I have finally reached a point this week where I have literally done almost no work and I feel that my depression is to the point where it hinders my ability to get out of bed, work, and gather the motivation to start on a task.**

- It doesn't help that since my team is entirely based out of India, it is very hard to communicate with them on my own time, it makes me look bad as a new developer because I take much longer to complete my tasks. I work remote 3/5 days of the week with nobody to talk to on my team even when I am on site. Then the ADHD doesn't help the very few days I finally have the motivation to work on something, but the concentration isn't there. And the rest of the days, I'm too depressed to get out of bed to even get on my standup call.

- I really don't want to tell my work about my mental state, but I feel that if I don't communicate to my work somehow, I'll look really bad and that I'm a lazy developer when I don't mean to be at all... I just want to know what might be some good things from a career standpoint to do from this point out to finally get back on my feet again.",1,1636747794,427,2262
"How stupid would it be to leave the field of ""data""/analytics/BI?","Hi everyone,

for the past 4 years I've been working in different roles which were all very much related to data (BI developer, data governance, analytical product owner). It's fine, but it's not something I really enjoy doing or that I'm particularly passionate about.

I feel like it's time for my next career step (want to relocate and switch companies anyway), and I just don't know if I should try to get another job that has to do with ""data"" in the broadest sense, or if it's also okay to switch to another field that seems more ""fun"" to me (I've been looking into fields like marketing, product management, technical (pre-)sales, etc.). 

Things to consider:   
a) I'm also someone who'd like to be ""in demand"" for the next few years at least.   
b) I've put a lot effort and time into my data-related skills and career, and I feel like my experience could land me some pretty cool jobs in this area, so I feel like I would ""throw all of this away"" when switching to let's say product management (a job you could also do with e.g. a business background).

Working on a team with a tech stack that isn't popular/growing - what to do?,"Hi all, here's the situation.

I'm a front end developer working on a team that uses Ember.js. As of 2019 [only 6.3% of javascript developers](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/top-javascript-frameworks-for-2019/) even use Ember.

2022 New Grad Review,"I've just finished up recruiting for a new grad 2022 software engineering role, and since past similar posts were super useful to me, I'd been thinking about writing up one of my own.

# Context

I'm a senior at an Ivy League school, majoring in CS. I did FBU (Facebook University, first/second year internship program at FB) the summer after my freshman year, and returned to FB the next two summers working in Java and then C++. I have pretty strong TAing experience in some more technical systems level classes, as well as some club leadership experience.

## Stats

Applied: 24

Online Assessment: 10

Explicitly Rejected: 5

Ghosted: 13

Offers: 6

# Applying

I had a standard return offer in hand from Facebook after my internship, but was disappointed by a lower TC than last year's offers and generally curious about other potential offers, so I applied pretty selectively to a combination of FAANG companies, top HFT firms, and unicorns. I also lucked into a referral from an AirBnB host which led to a verbal offer at a small secretive company, which I can't share details about.

Thinking back on my process, there are a couple of things that worked out well by luck and some that I would have changed. 

- Organization: I'd recommend a better system than I had for keeping organized. Even with a relatively small number of applications, I quickly lost track of which companies I'd already applied to and which ones had pending steps. I tried using huntr (basically a kanban board for jobs), but didn't update it frequently enough.

- Email: I used my school email for applications, but going back I'd have set things up with my personal non-spam email. I think there are probably benefits to this for recognizable names, but the downside was that important emails sometimes got lost in list serv spam from student groups. This may be coupled to the fact that I've basically given up on inbox zero, so this may or may not be generally applicable. 

- Scheduling/Timing: My school had a minimum offer deadline, which was what was on my return offer. I was applying pretty sporadically over late August to October, so I really lucked out in having five offers which were all simultaneously active.

- Adventitious offers: I got a totally viable potential offer from a random stranger, without going through any standard recruiting channels. It's not reproducible, but jobs can come from lots of potential avenues.

I want to shout out Google, Jane Street, Robinhood, Databricks, and Roblox for actually rejecting me by email instead of ghosting me like a dozen other companies. No idea why recruiting teams can't have some macro or program to sync their rejection lists with a template email.


# Online Assessments

I saw a pretty big range of different assessments. I think that the ones that I enjoyed the most were Stripe's and Optiver's which asked more real-world type questions with a complex setup but average algorithms.

I'm pretty firmly in the camp of hating CodeSignal as a platform. I dislike tying together applications to different companies on an arbitrary two-week boundary, and the sheer luck involved in drawing questions should really make companies question it's use in terms of false result generation. As an example, I got a 725/850 on one test for two companies with 1/2/1 (Easy/Medium/Hard), and on a practice test a few weeks later (which are supposedly equivalent), I got a score of 844/850 with 2/2/0. They also count time taken in an absurd proportion, making it better to skip hards if you get them. I have no suggestions here, just ranting.

I tried to avoid too much Leetcode grind, with varying success. Since my freshman year of college, I've done 260 problems (99E/154M/7H), but probably only about a third to half of that was for new grad specifically. I didn't follow Blind 75 or pay for Premium, though I did focus on one type of problem at a time. For problems with chains, it's definitely worth going through them sequentially if time allows. I think this is pretty common advice, but trying to memorize specific algorithms or problems is mostly a waste of time. It's better to focus on common patterns and types of questions (i.e. two pointers, backtracking, etc). I focused a lot on DP, but ended up not passing any of the OAs that asked DP questions, so ¯\\\_ (ツ)\_/¯. I also switched from Java to Python, but I recommend keeping familiar with two of Java/Python/C++, since some places want Java or C++ specifically (especially HFT). Python allows for faster code velocity/iteration in my experience, and is pretty expressive with a rich standard library, so it's good in coding interview situations. 

# Interviews

I think that the part that most trips me up in the interviews is talking through my process. I practiced this a few times in mock interviews, and also on my own, which I found to be helpful. Finding the right balance between letting your interviewer know what you're doing and actually knowing yourself what to do is tricky, but it's important to have buy-in from the interviewer. My worst interviews were when my interviewer wasn't following what I was coding. Also, even coding focused interviews mostly included some behavioral component. Having a pretty technical and in-depth project to talk about is super helpful for those, as is having real world engineering experience (collaborating with different groups, XFN peers, etc). If you don't have a good internship project to talk about, I'd try to make sure you have a decent group project from school or from a club.

I had phone screens and/or onsites with five different companies. In roughly chronological order:

## Microsoft

Timeline: Applied 8/31, invited to phone screen on 9/21, did phone screen 9/30, heard back the next day that I passed, scheduled an onsite for 10/15, and got an offer on 10/20.

The phone screen was pretty easy, a mix of OOP fundamentals and designing a stack with smallest item query. The onsite day was pretty long, with four 45-minute interviews, but there was nothing harder than a Medium. 

## Citadel

Timeline: Applied and received OA 8/31, submitted OA 9/3, heard back 9/7, phone screen 9/27, heard back 10/13, onsite 10/27, final round leadership call 11/2, offer 11/5. 

My phone screen was originally scheduled for 9/24, and I got as far as logging into the zoom room five minutes early, when they let me know that my interviewer was out of the office, so it got rescheduled for 9/27. Even though I bumbled through copy list with random pointer, I made it past the phone screen. The onsite was three 45-minute interviews, each asking wildly varying questions. Some had a mini behavioral section, most had a medium-ish coding question, or easy with follow-ups focused on code quality/modifiability, and I think one had tiny URL system design. After this step they also asked for a top five achievements list, which was a bit weird, but is apparently part of the CEO review process. My interviewer for the manager chat also missed the meeting, and I had to reschedule for later that day.

## Optiver

Timeline: Applied 9/20, got OA 9/22, submitted 9/24, heard back 10/1 and schedule recruiter screen 10/6, heard back from that 10/11 and scheduled a HackerRank review for 10/13, heard back from that 10/15, scheduled onsite 10/29, and got an offer 11/1.

The HackerRank had a long-time window (72 hours) and I took a couple hours on it to nicely comment and clean up my code. The engineering phone screen involved going over and fixing edge cases for the OA, so I definitely didn't get them all haha. The onsite was just two hour-long interviews, which in my case were mostly system design with a financial/trading bent. I think in general it's supposed to be one coding, one design, but my coding interviewer had me write pseudocode only and mostly discuss the system design. I think my systems classes/TAing actually helped a lot here, as I was able to talk pretty intelligibly about page sizes and caching decisions, as well as concurrency issues.

## Stripe

Timeline: Applied 10/2, received OA 10/5, completed 10/6, heard back 10/7. Had a phone screen on 10/13, heard back 10/14, scheduled onsite for 10/25, and got my offer on 10/28.

I signed an NDA for the onsite, so won't discuss specifics, but the process is really quite engineering friendly. Very few Leetcode style algorithm questions, and mostly focused on clean code and maintainability. Definitely my most enjoyable interview process all around, and a really quick recruiting process with short turnarounds. I attended a recruiting event the day before applying, and an interview prep workshop after the OA, so could be related to that.

# Offer Details

The part Blind is probably clamoring for: compensation details and offer breakdowns. I'm a very spreadsheet friendly person, so I probably had a slight bias towards quantifiable metrics like TC, but it was definitely not my only metric. Especially as a new grad, I think the most important factor is going to be learning opportunity, and how quickly that can be translated into more responsibility. In this metric, I think that Stripe and Facebook are equal and ahead of Microsoft. I'm not sure where to slot in the HFT firms. I've heard Citadel is much more competitive than collaborative, and I think the work would probably be less morally rewarding (though probably more financially rewarding). I'm also not really sure what the career progression will be like there. Apparently a relatively normal timeline is 2-3 years between promotions at Optiver, and their US CTO started out as a new grad only a decade ago, so I think it's pretty comparable to big tech in that regard.

A couple of notes on how I've calculated TC: for RSUs I've taken the three-year average annual return on the stock, and plugged that in to the salary calculator on levels.fyi, and also included the TC assuming no growth for comparison. To be clear, I don't necessarily expect these companies to continue growing at these rates, but it feels like a reasonable base for comparison at least. I'm ignoring refreshers, but they could potentially add \~10-30k on average to the amortized TC.

## Facebook/Meta (Seattle)
I got a standard returning intern offer, which they are not negotiating this year. 118k base, 10% bonus, 160k RSUs/4 years, and a 50k signing bonus plus 10k relocation. Amortized over 4 years with a 30% annual stock growth, this comes out to a TC of 215k, or 185k without any growth.

## Microsoft (Seattle)
Not negotiated at all, but there's probably room to improve the sign on at least, if not more. This is for L59. 115k base, 10% bonus, 120k RSUs/4 years (I think, possibly 3.5), and a 20k signing bonus and 5k relocation. Average TC of 220k with 45% annual stock growth, or 160k without any growth.

## Citadel Securities (Chicago)
My offer was for the securities side, which is apparently better (though not good) in terms in WLB. I'd be expecting 60-80 hour weeks, which isn't particularly attractive. 175k base, 100k guaranteed bonus first year, 100k signing bonus, 10k relocation. TC 300k amortized assuming no variation in the bonus (which is not likely).

## Optiver (Chicago)
The WLB seems likely better at Optiver than CitSec. The bonus is tied to your marble level (50, 100, 200, etc), and each marble is worth \~2k (last year was 6k but unlikely to repeat). 150k base, 80k first year bonus (then transitions to marbles), and 50k signing bonus with 5k relocation. Average TC \~250k, again ignoring bonus variability.

## Stripe (SF) [Accepted]
I tried negotiating, but couldn't get them to budge even with the higher CitSec offer. I've heard some mixed things about the RSU policy, but I think it could be a plus for rapid progression in TC as I would immediately get the next level grant after a promo. The policy makes the TC relatively insensitive to stock growth outside the first IPO year, since there's only one year of upside. There's also a new performance grant/refresher system that I'm not accounting for in TC calculations. 135k base, 10% bonus, 80k yearly RSU, and a 70k signing bonus split 50/20, with 10k for relocation. Over 4 years, average TC is 265k with a yearly 20% growth (i.e. RSU grant is worth 95k per year), or 250k assuming no growth.

I think that for me, Stripe offered a broader set of potential technical problems than trading, and probably with better WLB. I've heard some bad things about Stripe WLB, but I think it's pretty comparable to FB, and definitely better than in trading. Also, in the medium-term I think I'd prefer to be on the West coast rather than Chicago/NY, but YMMV.

"New grad, first job. Send help!","As a new grad, I looked for bigger, established companies that favored in-office work rather than remote after reading so many comments in this sub. I really wanted to have direct access to mentors and come into an established situation. A few months ago I got an offer for a job which I thought met this criteria but it turned out to be radically different. I mentioned some of my concerns to my coworkers but they are making me feel like I am the crazy person. I'll do my best to explain some of the goings on and hopefully I can get some feedback on this situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

This company provides software that helps in creation of certain industrial products. I don't want to get any more specific than that, but our software is pretty unique and apparently improves the profit margin for these producers significantly. Their processes at the plants are now reliant on our software.  

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't understand this until I started, but the team I was placed into was a small startup that had been acquired very recently, in a very distant city. By the time I started, only one of the team members was working in my local office. I am constantly being told that everyone else is apparently ""planning to move"" but it already has been months and I don't think they are really ever coming. My immediate team leader is included in this - I have met him only one time in the few months that I've worked here.  

&amp;#x200B;

But that was a thing in and of itself. When I started, I could not figure out who to report to. The manager I interviewed with told me it was ""Steve"", but ""Steve"" would not return any of my messages on teams. I would contact some of the other project leads for tasks (remember: most of them in distant far away city) and likewise would often get simply ignored. I sat with the one local coworker but he told me that I wasn't on his team either, and so he didn't have anything for me to do.  

&amp;#x200B;

 There was zero onboarding or training and I got no instruction for how to set up my environments. We are connecting directly to our customer's systems so its not something as simple as downloading whatever software. No one wanted to give me any of the connection info, what VPNs needed to be used or how to set them up, who to contact for the logins to the customer's systems, etc. Not that any of it mattered because apparently nobody had any tasks anyway.  

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually (after 2 months or so) I got access and started getting tasks. They ranged from small UI fixes, writing some code, and up to modifying tables in databases. These were all production systems because we have no test environment. When someone on the team makes a mistake that breaks the software, it results in massive loss of profits at the plants. I've been told it is six or seven figures per day for the plants. Since I have been here, I have seen our team's mistakes costs the plants 2-3 weeks of down time (across all our customers). In other words there are significant consequences for messing up. And its pretty easy to mess up. But there is no way to test any of the changes.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was super nervous when I was thrown into the live systems for this reason. The tasks started simple but quickly ballooned into very big things. I constantly asked to be supervised, double checked, reviewed, anything. But no one wanted to do that because they were too busy.  

&amp;#x200B;

I made a few mistakes myself which eventually caused big errors in the database. The problems didn't even show up for a few days after I made the change so its not like I could've caught it in the moment. My coworkers yelled at me, and said things such as ""didn't you get trained on this?"" and essentially saying that it was my fault that I didn't know. I know for a fact that I asked this person specifically to look over this change but I couldn't get any help.  

&amp;#x200B;

The customers don't seem happy at all with the support they've been receiving, and I've heard a lot of comments from them to the tune of ""we could email \[this team\], but they're not going to help us"". Some of the customers told me that they went months without receiving any support that they had paid for and they were looking for other options in the future. When I ask my coworkers, they just tell me that the customers will complain no matter what and it doesn't really matter what they do.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first job and I know basically nothing. Am I crazy thinking that it shouldn't be this way? I don't know if I should look elsewhere immediately or try to stick it out a year or two.

Current equity not vested - can I apply for new jobs now and ask them to wait? or cover the difference?,"I've been in tech for about 15 years and have a lot of good experience. As a consultant, I've been exposed to a ton of different stuff, but I'm not learning as much anymore and am thinking about changing jobs. But... that's basically all in one job, so I don't have a lot of practice with the whole job search thing.

Currently, I have a bunch of equity at my current employer. It vests in next August (little less than a year.) The difference between vested and unvested value when I leave would be \~$160,000.

But I found a listing for a principal engineer job I really want to apply for at a company where the total comp would be a big improvement. But probably not big enough to make it worth walking away from my current equity just before it vests.

So my questions are:

* How early is too early to apply? I've heard about new grads getting offers the year before they graduate, so... would applying now for Q3 next year look bad?
* Alternately, if they want me before I vest, how bad does it look to ask them to cover some of the difference? Are signing bonuses a thing right now in this industry?
* Or if I apply now, while that job is still open, does it look bad for a future application?

"Resigned from toxic startup job a few months ago, offered consultation services when they hired a replacement, but no longer want to associate with this company under any circumstances. Should I reply to ex-boss messages or continue to ignore him?","I worked at a small startup as a React Native developer for about 5 months. One non-tech and another semi-tech co-founder (both US based), a Unity and Back-end Developer (India based).

It was my first job as a software dev. Don't want to go into a whole lot of detail about the experience, but some notable points:

- I was easily working 80-100 hours a week
- Boss (COO) was extremely overbearing, little to no boundaries
- Verbally abusive
- Absolute, unending, persistent criticism over every aspect of my work output, personality and professionalism
- Ex-boss (COO) extremely disagreeable
- No mentorship, no senior level engineers to assist when stuck

I couldn't handle the stress. To keep up with the roadmaps I had to work anywhere between 10-13 hours a day, and anywhere from 8-10 hours on the weekend. 

Chalk it up to my inexperience, aggressive demands and pace of development from CEO. Both. I don't care. 

There were no boundaries with my ex-boss. He'd message me at 8pm. Interrupt me constantly throughout the day while I was working with issues he wanted answers to immediately. 

Two instances of verbal abuse I can recall. I was implementing in-app purchases for the application. Never implemented this before, was struggling. Ex-boss offered to be  a kind of rubber ducky to help me figure it out. I accepted reluctantly. At some point about a half-hour in we both come across an FAQ section of the documentation that appeared to resolve the issue I was running into. He then proceeds to berate me over a Zoom call, raise his voice in anger and ask me ""Why wasn't this the first thing you tried to do. We just wasted a whole day, when you could have tried this first.""

The fact of the matter was that I saw that FAQ, and it didn't solve the problem in the slightest, but I couldn't explain that to him in a way that he would understand because he's not a developer. He gets system designs and integration, but has no software level experience in anything except for SQL.

Another instance, I tried explaining to him that a feature he wanted developed would take me longer than expected. Tried explaining it to him, struggled because it's just very difficult to explain things to someone whose never written a line of code in his life. Wouldn't let me off the phone until I gave him an explanation he could understand. Ended the call with him angrily exclaiming ""I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S SOO HARD TO..."".

I called him out on his tone. I asked him, ""Do you understand how you berating me does nothing except destroy my self-esteem, and do nothing to help me resolve this problem faster?"" His response: ""I don't know what you want me to tell you. This is a startup, you have to be able to handle the pressure.""

I wasn't a co-founder in the company. I was an employee. Sure, there's a lot of pressure for employees to keep up with the CEO's demands. But as another redditor once put it ""Co-founder stress belongs to the co-founders, and shouldn't be passed down to employees"". It leads to toxicity in the workplace and employees leaving the company.

I sat one literally dozens of meetings where I'd be on a call with the India-based PM for our backend developer, where the entire meeting the ex-boss would be chewing him out. Raising his voice in anger. 

Nothing was ever the bosses fault. Nothing was ever the problem of a complete lack of qualified technical leadership and project management.

I was in the most amount of physically and emotional distress I had ever had in any job I've ever held. On the verge of burnout, palpable, heightened anxiety and stress that lasted for weeks on end.

The perpetual criticism, often petty, complete lack of positive feedback, ex-boss setting up his work-station right next to mine in the last few weeks before I resigned.... unbearable.

----------------------------

The fact of the matter is that both my ex-boss and I made a mistake with my employment. I knew the pressure would be high, I thought I could handle it, I couldn't. They hired a junior dev with no work experience to perform at the level of a senior dev. We both fucked up. 

So I resigned, put my two-weeks notice in, offered to consult at the time that they hired a new employee. But, a few months later... I'm sorry - for whatever my faults were as an employee, I know I wasn't perfect... but that job was a toxic hellhole, and my ex-boss is a shitty, shitty manager with total disregard for how he treats people working for him.

-----------------------------

When I resigned, my ex-boss suddenly turned into the nicest guy. Offered mentorship in finding my next job, to review my resume, suddenly started complimenting me on all my accomplishments, told me these would look great on my resume. 

The most bizarre change in personality that I can now only chalk up to them wanting to retain me as a consultant. I agreed to consult, but I was so completely mind-fucked by that point.

Anyways, the point of this post. He's been messaging me. Not ""Hi Dave, we hired a new dev. Would you have some time to discuss bringing you on as a consultant?""

Just ""Hey Dave!"". In my head I'm thinking... ""Hey WHAT?"". Don't respond. A few weeks later, ""Hey Dave!""... again, in my head ""HEY FUCKING WHAT?""

Emails me yesterday: ""Dave, hope all is well. I tried sending a couple of messages, not sure if they're going through, so I thought I would send you an email. Look forward to hearing back from you!"".

ABOUT FUCKING WHAT.

I don't want to engage with this guy, because I don't trust him. He's a manipulative asshole. ""Hey Dave!"" is a way to rope me into a fake, ""friendly"" conversation instead of just laying your cards on the table. Just tell me why you're messaging me. If it's for consultation, then I understand what we'll be talking about, and I can come in prepared to weigh the pros and cons of working with him again. 

I'm not this guys friend. I'm an ex-employee, and if he needs something from me, he can ask. I'm not responding to ""Hey Dave!"". 

Anyways... sorry for this long post.. it's like.. impossible for me to get to the point because all this ever does is bring up trauma... but I guess the question is.. should I continue ghosting this guy? I just can't bear to speak a word to him unless I know exactly what he wants to talk to me about. I don't trust him at all.",1,1636735751,1101,6322
How to deal with constant rejections mentally?,"Hi everyone,

I am backend developer with 3 years experience. For more background about me and my current career you can check my cv in here. https://www.overleaf.com/read/bmncztwmszpp

Actually, I started a new job recently but things are not going well in here and my old company was located in Spain so I want to relocate to EU for new opportunities. Cause I have some personal reasons. Currently applying some relocate available Python backend jobs from mostly LinkedIn. Also explaining why I am thinking to leave this company. 

Today, I got an interview from some Netherlands company. Made a phone call with them. It was quite good for me and the stages after call were like this. 3 question task &gt; tech call &gt; assignment &gt; another meeting &gt; hire. But I got rejected after phone call. 

There were times that I failed at technical assignments or tech interviews and I could understand that I need to improve but getting rejected after phone call with recruiter was a first and quite disappointing. I thought at least I would get 3 question task but even that didn’t happen. They said I wasn’t fit for position and nothing more. 

So I feel despair and losing my self esteem. How do I deal with getting rejected and the feeling of not being good enough?",1,1636735536,218,1270

"1st year BSc Comp Sci, not enough maths content. Interested in modelling. Which route would you take?"," I did an access course (science) to gain entry onto year 1 of a Comp Sci BSc at a decent polytech Uni (due to no maths a-level). The course is challenging &amp; I am enjoying it, but they have reduced the level of maths content from previous years. 

Ideally, I'd like to pursue something analytical, as modelling systems &amp; such interests me much more than web development, for eg. I plan on finishing the year at least, but I am beginning to worry that staying at this university will be a mistake. 

I believe it will be too late for me to try &amp; study for maths a-level at this time, though I am considering to begin studying for it if I can get ahead with the course. My two options then, appear to be to reapply to a different university for next year, which has more emphasis on maths content but may be lenient enough to take me on at year 1 given the circumstance, or otherwise continue at this university in hopes of gaining entry onto a data analytics MSc of some sort. 

I'm led to believe university prestige is important in finance roles &amp; believe a role such as quantitative development would interest me. If anyone had an advice or anecdotal information that could give me some direction I'd be eternally grateful.

How to get into MANGA company?,"I really want to work at a MANGA company because I heard they have high salaries after leaving college. I made one CRUD app (To-Do List) and can solve Two Sum. Why hasn't Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google, or Amazon hired me yet?",1,1636734762,42,224
Could I have an assessment / reality-check?,"Hi, I read through the FAQs etc on the sidebar, and I'm wondering if someone here can help me figure out if I have marketable skills/how to present them, or if I'm moving in the right direction?

I have a [Github profile](https://github.com/SpectralVectors) that hosts my work: mostly free/open addons (plug-ins) for Blender (3D Modelling program), written in Python.

I've used libraries like os, re, ctypes, math, urllib.request, contextlib, mediapipe, opencv-python to accomplish tasks like: translating node graphs, rerouting to stdout and printing to a .py file, downloading and installing addons remotely from Github, and other workflow tools within Blender.

Outside of Blender/Python: I've built and maintained Wordpress and Github pages sites, I've got a bit of experience with Linux/bash, js, though not a ton.

In trying to make my porfolio a little less niche I'm working on a Flask site with a MySQL database that gets populated through Scrapy spiders / API calls.

Previous experience/jobs include (more than this, but these are the most applicable):

* Broadcast TV post sound editor
* Podcast Producer (includes edit, upload, distribution etc)
* IT/Tech Support
* Music Teacher
* a degree and a diploma, neither are in CS, I did take a CS-101 course in college, fwiw

I love free/open source software, and my intention was to have a 'regular' job and continue with development in my time off, however, my current job is not giving me enough to get by, and I'm wondering if the things on my Github page are too niche to help in a job search?

I've merged pull requests into my repos, but I've never submitted one.

Some people have starred and forked some of my stuff.

I've worked almost exclusively inside Blender, but only via the Python API.

The OpenCV/Mediapipe addon is one that I forked and modified from someone else, does this affect whether it should be included in my projects?

When I'm reading job postings I feel hilariously under-qualified for anything, and when looking at some of the in-demand skills/languages/libraries, I'm not sure what I should focus on to build my skillset.

I guess I'm hoping someone can tell me what, if anything, my experience is worth?

And, are the broad strokes (I've used libraries X, Y, Z to accomplish...) a good way to present info about how your code works? (Sorry if I missed this in the resume thread).

Thanks!",1,1636734562,377,2380

Recruiter told me she was “sticking my neck out for me” so I “better sign an offer letter”,"Over the past couple weeks I’ve been I’ve been interviewing with a company that approached me about a job I was pretty interested. From the outside they seemed pretty good and for a while it was looking like they’d probably be my future employer (I’ll call them company A).

Then I started seeing red flags.

I got called by the recruiter from the company telling me I’d be getting in on-site interview. After that, she started asking me about the other companies I was interviewing at, why I was talking to them, and why I wanted to work at their company. Then she started asking “what would make the difference in your choice??” and I told her a competitive compensation package would be very persuasive.

She then begins pushing hard for a number or range. I declined and told her I’d like to wait until I get an offer (if I got one) to start salary negotiations. She says ok and then tells me to tell her about how my on site interview with another company (which I had tomorrow) went after I had it.

Turns out she needs me to agree on a number because the way in which offers are given at this company is that while you’re on site after the final interview, if you pass, they walk you into a room with the ceo, hand you the offer letter, and expect you to sign right then. And they won’t have me on site if they can’t get me to agree to a number. I thought that was weird but “eh maybe this is just their process.”

The next day I have my on-site with this second company (let’s call them company B). It goes very well, and I send this recruiter an email letting her know that.

“Can I call you now?” she says in an immediate reply email. 

So I’m in an airport on the phone with this recruiter, who’s extolling the virtues of her company and REALLY pushing me for a number. Eventually she figures out I already know what their starting package is, and at that point I agree to email her a counteroffer.

So I email her a counteroffer about 20% what their starting package. I also give her an offer letter I have from another company to show her that I’m getting more competitive offers from other places. She replies back the next day and says “we spent SO MUCH EFFORT coming up with this number” so “the offer is the offer”.

I cave at this point and agree to the on-site (I still thought this was my dream job at this point). After she finishes talking about the on site she said something that REALLY didn’t sit with well me.


“I’m sticking my neck out for you here, so you better sign if we give you an offer.”


So at this point I’m pissed. The on site with company A is scheduled to start tomorrow, and I DO NOT like what I’m seeing. At this point I immediately email company B, update them on the situation, and say “if I’m able to get an offer today and we can come to an acceptable compensation package, I will sign with you now and walk away from company A”

Company B send me an offer letter an hour later, and it’s quite acceptable.

So then I email my recruiter at company A, and tell them I’m walking away if I don’t get a counter offer. She congratulates me on my offer and that’s that.

How much of a bullet do y’all think I dodged here? Anyone experience anything similar?",1,1636732722,594,3197
I need a reference check - former employer seems to be giving bad reference,"I am almost 99% sure at this point my former employer is trashing me and sabotaging my ability to get a job and/or internship.

I had a job interview for a position at my school at I met all the requirements for and was 1 of 2 candidates left in the final round. After the interview I got an email a week later (after HR had called my former employer) and was told they went with the other person. 

I also had another job I wanted where I made it to the final interview round and during the interview they said they called my former employer and they now had concerns about my ability to fit in with other employees at the job...I really need someone to call my former employer and do a mock reference check to confirm if this is what they are doing and saying about me. I almost had this job and this keeps happening but want to confirm before I remove them from my resume.

"I want to change technology, but I don't want to learn it in my free time","I've been working with PHP for \~7 years, but I'm more and more tired of it. I'm not a genius, I'm not a hard-worker-stay-till-midnight but I enjoy coding and especially designing architecture, doing code reviews, improving code quality, streamlining and refactoring the code. 

The problem is that in basically every company, especially in the small ones, PHP teams are really badly managed, and half of the time I spend doing things, my PM should do, there's no time for refactoring, tests and so on.

I want to switch to something more ""boring"" like python, or C# where I don't have to do all by myself, stay after hours and so on. I want to work in a safe corporation, but they don't really use PHP (at least here, I live in Eastern Europe).

How do I pivot into tech?,"Looking for advice from anyone in a similar situation!

I'm struggling to find a new job using a different tech stack than my current position uses. What can I do to improve my chances of finding a new position with my preferred tech stack?,"I've been working in the field for a few years split between SDET work and full stack work at 2 different large enterprise companies. For backend work (which we have been pretty heavy on for awhile) I've used Java exclusively. I'm not enamored with Java as a language and don't want to be typecast as a Java dev forever so I've been looking to move on to a new tech stack. I started searching for a new job recently and have done a bit of tinkering in node.js in my off hours for around a month now and I've been liking it so far, but I wouldn't consider myself anywhere beyond novice level with it &amp; doubt I'll ever truly become strong with it unless I use it professionally full time.

Unfortunately, I'm in a bit of a pickle due to this. Outside of FAANG companies and occasional other large companies who are fine with whatever as long as you can do LC well (I admittedly can't yet, though I'm practicing) it seems like the vast majority of companies prioritize domain knowledge over general professional experience, probably since it's cheaper to avoid needing a new hire to pick up a new language and thus increasing their ramp up time. I usually make it past the resume screen (probably since I do have experience with Javascript/Typescript), but my lack of professional experience with node itself usually stops me from making it past HR because I don't have the right experience that they're looking for. 

I have a fair amount of freedom at my current job so I get some leeway into what technologies I use for smaller backend services. Is it worth pushing to use Node.js for some of these and taking a few months to get more experience writing the language in a professional environment then lying a bit to talk about how much I've actually used it, or is there another path I could take?",1,1636724758,325,1802
I think I've finally found a path to a new career. How realistic is this?,"I think I've found a path to a new career, but I'm wondering if this is a good idea. My goal is to get a CS degree and work for Jane Street or a comparable FinTech company with 1- 2 years of graduating.

-3 calc courses
-2 stats
-1 discrete math
-1 linear algebra
-1 differential equations
-1 phys (mechanics)
-3 CS/IT

This should take about 1 year, and then I want to transfer to the CS post-bacc at Oregon State University.

Ideally, I would like to have an offer (or internship) at one of the firms I've mentioned after graduating OSU, but if that doesn't happen then I'm planning to apply again after getting a grad certificate, again while studying for MSCS, and again after finishing my master's degree, if necessary.

But I was planning to be a good C and assembly programmer too, so I can use this knowledge to build my algorithms with high performance and minimal overhead. 

When I graduated, I was good with C and low-level concepts. Besides, I learned PyTorch and build my final project with it. I was planning to improve my knowledge about the fundamentals of machine learning so I can make my dreams real.

After I graduate, I got an offer from Japan. So I decided to accept it and today I am still happy that I accepted. 

In my current company, I am more like a backend developer. I say 'more like' because I don't know what am I anymore. I am trying to build an enterprise app around Laravel Framework. But this app needs some daemon services around and these services need speed and PHP is not enough. I am not saying that PHP is slow, but it is not enough for some tasks, so I developed several services with Java. Between PHP and Java, I implemented several connection protocols. I started with sockets, I tried some methods, today, they communicate with gRPC. Sometimes even Java wasn't enough, I used native libraries, I implemented them on JNI (thanks to my C background), which works like a charm today. We had some not generic data types on MySQL, which needs to be processed by some native libraries, so I implemented custom functions to MySQL using C, and today, all the processing is covered by MySQL. The whole algorithm works maybe 20 times faster. There is almost no overhead.

I am trying to explain my background because I know that there are seniors that already crossed that path. I feel lost. I feel satisfied with these problems, I love to solve them. I like my job. But I want to change company today, and I don't know what am I. When I look at positions, nothing fits me. Am I a backend developer? I know that there are better backend developers out there. What makes me special? Or maybe I am nothing. Because I feel like I don't have any expertise and I feel lost under all of the knowledge. 

These days, I am thinking about a master's degree. I don't want to go to the academy back, because I really feel like I want to use these skills in production, but maybe it can help to make my career path visible again.

Had a panic attack at work today. Prioritise your health people!,"Due to a stressful combination of unrealistic deadlines, neglecting my physical health, and taking adderall to help me focus, I had a panic attack at work today. Luckily it happened outside of the office and got help from a coworker and others, but it was one of the scariest experiences I've ever had. I felt extremely lightheaded and almost passed out twice.

I'm no longer going to prioritise work over my health. My right foot which has poor circulation and feels half-numb will be taken care of. I'll stop taking adderall which increased my anxiety even more. I'm going to meditate and do yoga. Lastly, I ordered myself a seat cushion which will hopefully help my back and sciatica.

Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life, but I hope it was also a turning point for my health. This is a reminder for all of you to take your health seriously and don't let work cause you too much stress.",1,1636718855,161,900
Name and Shame: Northwestern Mutual,"I had a first-round interview with a recruiter who asked me about about my background my technical skills. She also asked  a few behavioral questions but nothing hard.

By the end of the allotted time she asked me about salary expectations which is often a red flag for me: a serious company will tell you how much they normally offer for the position. Anyway, I tell her that 100k base salary would be the minimum for me: I have nine years of experience, the job would be remote and I live in a relatively large city in the Midwest.

After that she tells me they have been having trouble finding engineers at the P2 level (P1 would be entry level) and they're considering changing the requirements to P1 but the salary would be around 80k. I already knew where that was going and like I thought she mumbles something on the line of ""we don't want to waste your time of course so I wonder if that would be enough for you in case we switched to P1"". I said ""Sorry, no. Entry level salary isn't reasonable for me"". I haven't heard from her in a couple of days and I don't think I will at this point.",1,1636718559,207,1097

What should I do? How do I make myself marketable to land a SW job?,"I graduated from college last year May 2020. I am still having a hard time landing a dev job. I have applied to 300+ jobs and I am still not getting any luck. I didn't get a lot of interviews either, probably 2. one of the interviews I got was from Microsoft (Bing Ads team) which surprised me anyways and long story short I bombed it. All the rounds were fine until at my final round with the hiring manager. I was asked about a hard Hacker Rank tree question and I froze, me and the hiring manager also had some communication issues as I didn't understand some parts of the questions due to his accent. It was a great experience though.

How can I leverage a good first impression on IT managers to get refered to the swe dept?,"TLDR - 1.5 semesters left in uni, no job lined up, a meeting with a senior manage of IT solutions fell in my lap, want to steer the conversation toward getting referred to the swe dept. how do i navigate the conversation?

I was fortunate enough to be part of a select few students who were invited to a university football game to meet and greet managers of an IT company. It was fun, and I'm glad for the opportunity. However all of these managers were IT solutions architect managers and similar/peripheral roles. 

I'm not sure how I got selected for this event in hindsight; seems like CIS-types would be more into these kinds of jobs. As a CS major, I want to do software engineering/development. I didn't hesitate to express that I wanted to focus more on software development and cultivate swe skills rater than IT solutions.

Anyway, it turns out that they liked me the most and had their manager reach out to me. He wants to meet for coffee. As a soon-to-be graduate with no job leads or offers, I was inclined to say yes. It could be of great informational value or even just a good networking/interview exercise for me. But what is the best way to navigate this meeting? 

Should I ask if he can put me in contact with someone on the sw side of things? Should I just bring my resume and point out all the non-IT things on it?",1,1636714159,245,1337

A Big tech company recently did a grad hiring at my university. I did fair in all the interview rounds.

They also said I'll be kept in some list of candidates and they might reach out in three months (if there is any opening). But if I don't have a good GPA, I doubt they'll take me in at a later point.

Need some advice on a Job Promotion/reposition,"I posted this comment in the Daily Chat yesterday, but I got some more information since then and wanted to know if this was the best move:

 

&gt;So recently I've been looking for roles outside of my Current one (QA Analyst) as I've been there nearly a year now and don't want to be in testing too long, and split between a couple of things,  
&gt;  
&gt;Basically my manager has offered me a place as part of a Third Line support but will mainly be bug fixing and a lot of code related work and minor feature fixes, he says this may be a good stepping stone to full dev within another year and gets me first hand knowledge on the codebase we use and may be easier to get experience without having a blank slate on newer features.  
&gt;  
&gt;But is this advisable compared with just finding a dedicated SWE role? Even starting at a Junior level? I suppose technically I would be classed as a SWE still and having some experience on my Resume is always going to be a bonus, but I'm not sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;For some background on my experience, I've posted it below:  
&gt;  
&gt;2/3 years out of University, now 33 years old, before this, I did IT tech work, security and retail stuff, I don't include those on my Resume but briefly mention I did work before University  
&gt;  
&gt;last 3 years I have experience in Customer Support Engineering (more problem solving for customers, some coding was involved for workarounds) and in that time, created most of their website  
&gt;  
&gt;Made redundant when they closed the office I was in, mostly due to COVID and had no room in London's Office, so out of a job for a little while  
&gt;  
&gt;Took a job as a QA Analyst with a view of progressing to Software Dev when I could (after a year or so) there is some coding involved and my skills as a web dev/ C# .Net do come in handy, they've allowed me access to look and learn the codebase and do seem like they want to promote me to Dev when its less busy (right now they need someone to hit the ground running)  
&gt;  
&gt;I recently updated my Resume and Linkedin and included my newer skills and Github Repos show newer projects I've been working on (mainly React and Leetcode Submissions (more as a place for notes on solutions))

As for my question, this role is officially classed/titled as ""Application Support Developer"" and although not discussed pay, would be worth more to me per year (currently on £30k as QA Analyst) but what worries me here is being pigeonholed into Support again or Testing when really I want to focus on SWE roles, but would this be a good step up into this, potentially skipping the Junior roles perhaps?",1,1636709257,494,2640

Should I ignore my internship offer and risk not getting a better internship?,"I'm in a predicament that I'm not sure what to do in. I'm looking for an internship over the Summer 2021 and already have a software engineering internship offer for NCR that expires in the next few days, but I don't know if NCR is necessarily the right fit for what I want to do (I don't necessarily want to work for the banking industry and they only pay $30/hr, but I'll take it if it's the only thing I have). For reference of where I am in my college degree, I will graduate sometime in the Spring of 2023 with my undergrad degree at Georgia Tech. I will also be doing a one year master program, so I effectively only have 2 summers left. So here's my conundrum:

I can just accept the NCR offer for this coming summer and see if I can get better opportunities next summer. At that point, I would have just graduated with my Undergrad degree and working on my one year masters. I won't be devastated if I choose this option, but I will be kind of bummed thinking that there could have been other places that I could've worked at, or,

I can forgo that NCR offer and continue applying to places with a risk that I just won't get an offer at all, or the only offers I get won't be as good as the NCR offer. At this point, I haven't really applied to the big tech companies, but I did apply to Amazon and got ghosted. I've also been told that reneging is a thing that I could do, but that I shouldn't really do it because of its repercussions.

My goal is to point to get a chance to work at FAANG or any of the larger tech companies (either intern or full time), so I'm hoping to work for a company this summer that will allow me to stand out to recruiters. At this point, I don't think any of the big tech companies will even look at me.

IT auditing vs Business System Analyst?,"I am in my third year of an IT degree where I have the following specialization options: Business Systems Analyst or IT Auditing and Assurance.

Is IT auditing hard to get into without certifications?

Internship at Infosys Instep,"Hi, I am a software engineering student (just finished second year), and I think I might get an offer from Infosys Instep internship soon. I know that Infosys has a positive reputation for a lot of people, but for others it does not. 

I have been given a few offers so far, but most of them required me to take a gap semester and were more suitable for new graduates. I received an offer from a startup in Silicone Valley, but also having talked to the recruiters, I think I will get one from Infosys soon as they said that they are not planning to cull anymore candidates (I am in the final round interviews that place me in a suitable project).

The internship at the startup is a QA engineering role, which involves automated testing. I am happy with this offer, but given that it's not a software development role, I think that I will benefit more from Infosys' InStep internship where I hope to be placed in a software development project. I need to decide on my offer at the startup in about three days, and final round interviews at Infosys are happening after those three days. 

Should I reject the offer and go to Infosys? What is Infosys InStep internship like? Infosys seems to have such a polar-opposite reputation depending on who you talk to. Would interning at Infosys disadvantage my resume in the future?

When working remotely / overseas -- is the salary range including taxes (etc) or not?,"Hi. My whole career (nearly 10 years) have been as a proper employee, everything taken care of by the employer and the accounting departments. So I feel a bit lost.

I am currently looking into working remotely but I am a bit confused on how to charge.

Let's take a random job posting. They offer 100,000 USD, so that's what I would get before taxes. Let's assume the take home is 75,000 USD. 

Now imagine I want to apply for a job posting that specifies remote work and the salary also says 100,000 USD. Some questions:

* Since we are in different jurisdictions, they might not be able to process me as a normal employee. So the options could be
   * I start a company and invoice them the full 100,000 USD from that company and do some taxes
   * I give them my local bank and they transfer the full 100,000 USD, then I do some taxes myself

Since I have to do my own taxes which might be higher, I might end up with way way less than the 75,000 USD. Which brings me to the next question.

Usually when a company pays 100,000 USD as a salary, they have other costs such as medical and their taxes and whatnot. Maybe that employee actually costs 150,000-200,000 USD for them.

Due to this (taxes + lower employer costs) freelancers generally charge more (to pay taxes, medical etc) to end up with the same 75,000 USD. Right?

So. Should I as a remote/freelancer actually ask for MORE than what the job posting is specifying?

\---

I guess it's dependent on a **bunch** of factors in the end. But I hope a general answer is possible still.",1,1636697226,281,1543

Seniors advice about this?,"Hi, just created this account in order not to 'dox' me.

I have been working with this company for several years \~10 my company have been acquired by a bigger one, now with the merger the acquiring company is pushing aggressively for offshoring in order to reduce costs at a minimum I have several senior colleagues (QAs, Devs, DBas, sys admins) who have been 'happily' laid off with a severance package.

I have been asked to interview and hire contractors to replace them, unfortunately the contractors lack of several skills to do the entire job properly. But we were forced to accept them nonetheless by upper management.

Now since they came in the decrease of quality in the new software pieces has created significant pressure on the 'in-house staff' over time:

The new offshored devs fails to solve simple technical problems to achieve their tasks;

And for the low output, the new QAs are unable to understand/test properly the new code;

Overall passive attitude of the vendors;

Creating lots of bugs in prod, prod is now the new test environment XD ;

I have been discussing these issues with my manager and he says 'don’t worry do what you can' type of response.

Now I have been working 55+ hours a week just to try helping fix all the crap that has been deployed; For several months, this apart from on call That I am doing 1/X weeks,  the pager is ringing more and more, like... every day... this has become a nightmare.

I am not counting all the new responsibilities that are being thrown at me offside and that my boss is not giving training for and I need to spend 'of time' just in order to learn the new tech I have been asked to work for.

The business side of the things is irresponsible and accept all new features without providing serious quality standards;

I don't have a wife and/or kids... I feel like poor management is creating these problems. I have friends in IT who told me to GTFO I feel like I need a 'reset'; but also I think my managers trust me; The salary I get is average.

have I been making sacrifices for a company that is not worth it? Am I a retard?

So my questions: 

	Is this acceptable or even normal for a senior to work 60h/w even after 10 years in a company?

	How much time does the seniors here are spending 'of time' to cope with the new responsibilities?

What is your take on this situation?",1,1636694131,412,2353

Underachieving guilt,"TLDR: how do I stop feeling guilty for getting paid a high salary to do fuck all? 

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I recently started with a new company on a 6 figure salary, and feel like I’m not doing enough work. I found I can vastly overestimate tasks and just do 1-2hrs of work a day, and everyone seems impressed with my work. The problem is that for the rest of my day I feel riddled with guilt for not being productive. But if I try to work through the day 5 days a week I just find myself feeling so burned out.

As a bit of background, I’m in Australia, still getting my bachelors at uni part time, so this is a pretty good gig salary-wise. Company is a startup only a few years old and is absolutely not something I’m at all passionate about - I like money. Sticking around until I finish uni in about a year and then going for a FAANG/MANGA job is the plan right now.

Anyone else had this experience? What did you do?",1,1636691286,179,930
Background check for no-W2 experience?,"I'm wondering what's typical to include on a background check form. I'm doing this through HireRight in the US.

I've had two paid, full-time positions since graduation. However, on my resume, I also have:

* Unpaid undergraduate CS research experience at my university
* Independent day trading experience where I made $xxx,xxx
* Failed startup experience as a co-founder that joined an accelerator

HireRight doesn't give you an option to enter any of those three accurately. I.e. all past experience entered through their application portal needs to be:

* Paid either directly by your employer or through a third-party
* Or paid *and* self-employed

In other words, they only allow you the option to enter paid positions that are verifiable through W2s.

I ended up choosing to leave those three items out of the background check form as there wasn't a way to accurately enter them through their site.

Would this be acceptable? If HR comes asking why I've omitted some things on the background check form that were on my resume, I'd explain that there was no option to accurately enter those three experiences on their website.",1,1636690823,178,1132
Undecided route for CS,"I have a bachelors in communication studies but want to make a career change to software developer. I’m just having trouble which route I should go to in order to get there. I’m not sure if I should start from step 1. And get bachelors in computer science, or get a certificate, or just go try to get a masters in computer science. I know many employers want candidates with a CS degree or something equivalent so I’m too sure the certificate would be a good route. Those of you who made the career transition, please let me know your suggestions! thanks",1,1636689430,102,554

Should I consider SDET role for 40% more pay?,"I interviewed for a Systems Engineer position at a start-up. However, they are looking for a more Senior SE but invited me to come onsite for an SDET role instead. 

My ideal role would be SDE or Systems Engineer (DSP algorithms). I currently work as the latter at a stable company and like my job other than the mediocre pay. My main concern is there seems to be a stigma around SDET and if I am paving a career in testing rather than developing that I can't get out of later, I'd rather stay in my role.

On the other hand, this might be a good opportunity to break into SDE. My background is not in CS so I've had trouble clearing LC interviews at big N companies. Recruiter said there will most likely not be whiteboard coding for onsite and it is more of an informal meet and greet with the team. The bottom of the salary range is still a 40% increase from my current role and their salary range is the same across all roles (SDE, SDET, Systems, Firmware) which makes me believe it would be easy to make a lateral movement. Recruiter mentioned there would be opportunities to wear many hats if something else piques my interest but not sure if I should take his word for it.

Is SDET on your resume as bad as people make it out to be on Reddit/Blind? Or should I take the SDET if given an offer? 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",1,1636688118,251,1337
Deciding Between New-Grad Offers - Deloitte (NYC) vs CapitalOne (Wilmington) PLEASE HELP!,"I am a senior graduating with a computer science degree, and currently have two offers that I have a few weeks to decide on, and I would really like some help.

One is from Deloitte, in the position of Solutions Engineer Analyst, with a starting salary of $90K in New York City. The other is from CapitalOne, for a classic Software Engineer position in the TDP (Technology Development Program), with a starting salary of $116K in Wilmington, Deleware.

Though on the surface it might seem like an easy choice because of a significant salary difference, location is really big for me, as I really thrive off exciting life outside of work/school, and I have completely fallen in love with NYC and all the opportunities for that there. Because of this, and with Deloitte still being a livable wage, I am quite heavily leaning towards Deloitte.

**However, my main reservation is in fact with the work itself.** I have done two summer internships, both of which were traditional software dev positions, both specifically being full-stack web development. CapitalOne seems to offer something much closer to that, and I feel like I am guaranteed a much more ""safe"" route career- and experience-wise with it.

In order words, I feel like if I do move on from my first job, CapitalOne's position description and the experience I got from it would be taken quite well by other companies with traditional software development jobs.

With Deloitte, on the other hand, it's not so clear. Firstly, the work would change every few months as I switch projects. Secondly, it's hard to know what my day-to-day could look like, how similar it would be to a normal software engineering job at CapitalOne, for example. Because of this, my fear is that if I moved on from Deloitte, my experience wouldn't be valued as seriously and I would have started my full-time career on a bad foot if I'm going down the software development route, which so far is where I've been going and likely see myself continuing down.

**So my main question is really:** are my reservations about this fairly accurate? Would this position from Deloitte not be considered as seriously by, say, a job recruiter later down the line for a normal software job? Or is it not really the case, and software work at Deloitte is taken as respectfully as with a company like CapitalOne.

Any and all advice is appreciated! Additionally, if something else sticks out to you that you'd like to bring up to me, I'd really appreciate that as well. Thank you everyone!",1,1636687325,425,2510

GCM Grosvenor Internship,"Has anybody ever worked here or interned here? I have an internship offer here for this summer and have not been able to find anyone discussing it online at all. I'd love to be able to PM you, but here are some of the things I am most interested in (I've also already shot off an email to recruiter asking some of these):

1. What's the potential like for getting an offer to return full-time after graduation?
2. How did they pay you? My offer was ""the annualized equivalent of $75K, paid semi-monthly."" Like, if the internship is 10 weeks, wud I get (10 / 52 weeks in a year) \* $75K or (10 / 4-ish weeks in a month) \* ($75K / 12 months in a yr). I'm guessing it'd be closer to the former option?
3. What's just the general vibe of the workplace? When I asked the four ppl there who interviewed me what they liked about the company, they were usually like ""We use really modern technologies, the people are smart, and you're encouraged to work hard and grow."" And like the answer I was looking for there was like ""the people are great."" Not necessarily a deal breaker but definitely something to consider so I'd like to hear people's experiences.
4. For people who have worked there, what does the starting salary/salary trajectory look like? I've scoured glassdoor and all that shit but I feel like it's still really hard to tell from that alone. 
5. What sort of stuff in particular did you work on?

Looking for mentors and Java/SQL/Python/React projects,"I took my first programming classes (Java,SQL, data structure) in junior year and missed my chance to be a computer science major. Now that I am one year out of school, I realize I really like programming and taught myself front end languages and Python. 

While I’m working on brushing up my skills and refreshing my memory on leetcode, I wonder if anyone needs another set of hand for their project/product and is willing to be my mentor! I realize building projects on my own might not be the best way since I tend to stay in my comfort zone and use the dumbest/most ineffective way to solve problem.

Take a better position at the current role or follow my passion and keep learning how to code?," I'm very passionate about coding. I realized that's what I wanna do with my life. I'm few months into learning, it's going okay, not fast but steady. My current job is also stable, moderately interesting, not stressful and I even have some extra time to learn. I've been here for almost 6 years though, kinda bored of it overall.

I recently got an offer in another big famous company for the same role as I do here. It will look great on a resume, it's more money, potentially more interesting stuff, but also very busy. Overtime most likely. I won't have no time to fulfill my coding dream. (Although recruter says they can have some internal trainings and if I really want to they can eventually transfer me to be a developer.)

This career in general for me is moderately interesting, but I don't see myself doing that for too long. I am already doing if for too long. It's fine, but not what I really want or passionate about.

Should I do a reality check and take this offer in a new company with more money and new maybe better and at least different environment? Is that a chance of a lifetime that I'm missing? I think I'm getting less hirable the longer I stay in my current company...

Or should I continue coding for 1-2 more years to see if that works out for me well? Stakes are high, I have plans for it - remote jobs, own projects, software companies, etc. But so as that new job offer that I can miss and never have again and be stuck here forever.",1,1636683988,271,1466

Ghosted by the HR recruiter,"I went to two interviews (and the only interviews in the hiring process). It went well overall. The team members during the second interview reassured me that the HR will get back to me with their final decision the next week (this happened october 15th).

October 22nd : the HR sent me an email to let me know that they have a positive impression overall but that they will need more time to interview other candidates before making the final decision. They said they wanted to have 3 finalists among which I am.

 I didnt receive any further information so I sent an email to the HR (november 1st) to see if there are any updates. No response.
 
I sent another email last monday (november 8th) again and still no response up until now.

My situation is really bad because If i dont sign a contract the next week I will have to leave the country because Im on a temporary residency permit.

Question on where I could direct my career ?,"So I've been working as a junior back-end developer for a start up company for about 10 months now. Overall I would say that the experience has been great. I've been learning a lot about software development at my start up and understanding what it means to actually build a project from the ground up. It's a lot of work but it's very rewarding. 

Recently, I've been thinking about the different paths I can take with my skill set in the future and what I could do on the side or perhaps what could become my main source of work if all goes well. I was wondering what it would be like to make websites for clients using flask with a react front-end and SQL database or something similar or perhaps building android applications or IOS applications on upwork  ? or maybe get into teaching software development skills ? 

I understand that it's different than just being a backend developer. I would be dealing with customers and providing customer support on my own. I would just like some insight  and realistic expectations in terms of monthly income from someone who's currently doing this line of work in our profession. 

This is not something I obviously would want to jump into but am just having questions about.

"Fullstack web dev for 7+ years, mostly PHP - Moving to Python: yes, no, hard, easy?","Hey all,

As the title mentions, I've been a web dev for 7+ years (and even more than that if I count the sites I've worked on before I started my career). I've always been using PHP (+ the usual frontend stack html/css/js/js frameworks). That's what I learned before I started working and I've been happy with it. However, I feel limited by it, I rarely see interesting opportunities for PHP dev. As for skills, I don't think I can push it a lot further. So I've been thinking moving on to something else. Either nodejs or python. I feel like python will open up more doors since it's used for more than just web development. Is that even a good idea?

The other problem is that I've only used python a tiny bit and I have no idea how fast I could push it to a professional level. I think I should be ok, since it's not the first language I'll learn, it seems pretty standard to me. I have no idea if a company looking for a python dev would hire someone like me. It's hard to trust yourself when you don't fully match a job offer.

Anyway, if anybody has any insight, feel free to share :) And if that matters, I'm in north america.

Advice for a young CS student?,"Hey all, I’m currently 18 y/o and am majoring in Computer Science. I had a couple questions as a newbie in the space. My first semester, I was a mechanical engineering major, but after some thought have made the switch to CS. Here are just a few questions I have that I was hoping you guys could answer:

1. As a CS major, is there any minor I should take/ or maybe a potential double major? 

2. As of right now I’m a freshman, but coming into college I had 7 credits, took 18 credits this semester, am taking 21 next semester (its a lot I know) and than plan on taking atleast 10 in the summer (once I get 56 credits I’m considered junior status). Ive been told once I hit junior status, that opens the door for a lot more internships and associate software engineering roles as most want you to be atleast junior status. Is there any benefit to this strategy? (Currently 4.0 GPA btw)

3. What should I do on the side to make myself Look better? I was told do a lot of side projects which I am doing right now. I’m currently doing a UDEMY Web Dev course where by the end you have 4-5 projects already done (personal portfolio page, small game). The langauges are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also some other ones I wasn’t too familiar with, can provide later if need be. I take my first coding class next semester (intro to python).

4. What’s the best way to land an internship? I don’t go to a top tier school rather a regular state school in Michigan. What edge can I get against other interns to make up for the school I go to (if that’s even a thing). From what I’ve heard experience is king, so the more internships I do the better. 

5. I was told by a friend that AWS Certs will help me a-lot in landing jobs and internships  as well. He suggested doing the Solutions Architects Associate &gt; a second one I can’t remember&gt; and than Aws dev ops last. Is this true, if it is I’ll start studying so I can take the exam in the summer.

6. Any other general advice? Things to keep in mind or any other gems? Thank you all for reading.",1,1636677584,388,2042
Better Internship?,"Hi. I'm curious as to which of Facebook and Pinterest would be better for final SWE internship.

Comp: Pinterest wins at p much all levels 

WLB: not sure, but Pinterest seems a little chiller

culture: heard okay things about both, but FB seems a little more cutthroat than Pinterest (fb internship kinda feels like a long interview for full time)

growth as employee: FB seems to win (company seems to be exploring really cool tech and does promotions by performance as opposed to tenure)

company future: more sold on FB, but the company is also growing pretty big which could be good or bad

likelihood of return offer: idk ab Pinterest but I've heard FB is kinda tough

I have no idea what is my long term career goal,"TLDR; Recently I was asked about what are my future, long term career goal and whether I could describe them in couple sentences. After thinking for a while I reached the conclusion that I have no real idea where I see myself in next couple years.

Here is my story: for the last 6 years I have been working in a typical consulting company. My main expertise is embedded software and that's the main type of project I was working on. Additionally, I was also doing typical full stack development (backend services, web applications), was architectured cloud platforms, managed CI/CD build systems , did mobile application development and even some data analysis. In other words: whatever needed to be done, I was doing that. Apart from my main work I also did some side contracts/projects in the mentioned areas.

I got the opportunity to move to the new startup (focused in couple domains), but since they are mostly focused on the research, my start role would be DevOps with occasional general software development (they are just starting, so I understand they need to build many things at once). I was also told they are open to moving me to a different role once they got more clarified goals and requirements, but at the same time they want to know what are my plans for the future.

While I was thinking what sparked a joy past those couple years I realised everything is interesting to me to some degree. I like doing cloud development, writing embedded code, play with full-stack, even make mobile apps.

I know some of you may say I might give it a shot and always leave if I am not satisfied, but I do not think this is an answer I am looking for.",1,1636676059,293,1658

are my expectations for code reviews too high?,"tl;dr me the intern sent a PR with stupid but working code, no one commented anything about it, said stupid code is now biting me in the ass and I’m feeling like this can’t be 100% my fault??

\--

I’m interning at a large company, my project is mainly overseen by three people. a while ago, I made a batch of front-end changes and sent a PR, got a few comments. they were mostly trivial stuff like variable names, indentation (I was expecting them to point out places where the code was written badly/inefficiently and I’d have to refactor it but I didn’t get anything like that— which I felt was fine at the time). 

currently, I'm again working on FE changes which should have been straightforward— I was told they would be really similar to the last iteration but there are some extra stuff I need to do. however I’m running into a ton of issues and after researching online, I realized that some are because of a misunderstanding I had about the ui library I’m using (vague for privacy). I went back to my first PR and saw I made *this exact mistake* *in like 4-5 places throughout* but magically it never broke my program— but why did no one comment on this on my PR? sure it *worked* but isn’t that the bare minimum?  (plus now because I didn’t know my mistake and worked off of code that’s bad practice *at best*, I can’t even get my new code to work, and that’s gonna be blamed on me) knowing the error now, I don’t understand how someone who actually knows how to use this library didn’t say “hey you can't call this function like this, it might cause issues later”. my PR is not closed because we need to wait on other changes first, but it’s been out for enough time for people to put comments and for me to respond to them.

there’s only one actual FE guy on the team so I get that he’s busy, but my perspective is that if the only person who’s able to help me with my code can’t get 30 mins to properly read through a \~700 line PR sometime in weeks (it went out to my whole team and he did leave a few comments but as mentioned before, they were trivial stuff so I just feel like he didn't really even read it), then a project involving significant front-end work should not be given to an intern. I’ve generally been performing badly due to multiple factors that I have varying degrees of control over, but this incident in particular has me frustrated because some of the bugs that are delaying my project could have been avoided if someone noticed my shitty code the first time around— or maybe I was expected to not write shitty code in the first place and this is all my fault, idk. 

tell me if I'm being needy, or is it reasonable to want people to point out stuff in your code that might be problematic later and help you out when you have (obvious, now) gaps in knowledge? was my PR so big that no one actually felt like reading through it? I'm not sure how long it takes to read and comment on a PR, and I feel like it’s rude to directly ask “but did you look at my code PROPERLY” if I only get a few comments lol. I’ll be an FTE next year (not on this team, I don’t think they even want me back lol) and I just want to know in the future how to get a decent code review :( ",1,1636675924,611,3199

The extra responsibility isn't too much anyway. Just run a few meetings, keep track of some ongoing issues, and nudge people to do a task every now and then. (Basically look after operational processes on our team). Plus this kind of thing might look good on the resume in time.

I plan on enrolling into university for CompSci in about two years. How can I prepare ahead?,"I’m asking in regards to, “what should I study/learn for university right now in order to do well in CompSci when I start?” 

I dropped out of college and went active duty military about a year and a half ago. My highest math level is college algebra. I watched calculus on Khan Academy for a bit, but it seems I need to learn more of the foundations before I can confidently continue. Many say to learn linear algebra and discrete math, but I’ll need to know how to work up to that level. 

I’m currently learning the basics of Python. My goal with this is to at least have an understanding of programming when I take CompSci courses. Some say don’t even worry about coding, that the university courses will square me away. Others say keep coding and do projects, so I’m a little confused. 

I have until August 2023 to become knowledgeable on various CompSci topics and pre-requisites. What more do you recommend everyone begin learning/practicing today in order to be successful once they start CompSci in university?",1,1636674925,179,1020
Getting Software Internships with Online Applications,"I am a third year software engineering student in Canada. I was curious what others experiences have been with online applications for internships for success? Did you receive interviews after applying to many companies, or did you need to make a connection with someone in the company?

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to &gt; 100 jobs last year online, and didn't receive a single interview despite this, so I wanted together some information before I repeat that",1,1636673980,73,457
Choosing between two vastly different offers,"So, I have an opportunity to join Salesforce. The kicker is that it's not a SWE role; it's something dubbed ""System Engineer"".

I had a hard time figuring out what exactly they mean by that as the JD thew a kitchen sink of requirements out: python, node, JavaScript, AWS, sql, variety of other stuff.

I was able to figure out that it's basically a support role that is somewhere between a dev and SRE: poke around various setups to identify problems caught in monitoring, create and upkeep said monitoring, etc. it's a new team in a new org so things are in flux and by the sounds of it, many hats are required.

The neat thing is there are no stand-ups or sprints, which sounds great to me, because I'm tired of that.

The other company is a Fintech medium sized company in the Midwest that's building a greenfield project. I really liked the people I interviewed with there (SF on the other hand is faceless and corporate as you can imagine, though I hear it's a good place to work)

Both companies are contract-to-hire. Both companies pay the same.

I think what I'm looking for is somewhere I could coast a bit more so SF sounds better in that regard (it's easier to coast in huge megacorps in my experience) but again, it's extremely vague wtf a systems engineer does - I don't want to be on a 12 hour long sev1 call every day.

Do you have any thoughts on SF? Opinions welcome.",1,1636673545,248,1384
What to do about team senior who never responds to emails/IMs/etc?,"Hey all, got a bit of an annoying issue to figure out but not sure how to best go about it.

So I'm a couple of months into my first SWE role and everything has been great so far! Everyone on my team is friendly and always willing to show me stuff I don't know, the tasks I'm being given are ramping up at a fair pace, and it seems like everything else is pretty good!

However, probably the biggest and easily most annoying issue is one I have with one of the senior devs on my team. Everyone else is super easy to reach, whether it be that they respond immediately to my messages or they're available at their desk when I need to pop in for something. But this senior dev is NEVER available and ALWAYS has an excuse to why they can't answer my question when I have one.

Now this wouldn't be so bad and I really wouldn't care that he's never available if it weren't for the fact that almost all of my tasks at the moment revolve around a weird domain space that only he knows well enough to answer questions for. It's especially a huge pain when I need him to review almost all my PRs (since I'm just a junior and don't want to mess things up) but he has yet to let me know whether the work I'm doing is actually correct.

Many of my other tasks given to me were reviewed by other seniors on the team that could and each person gave solid feedback as to what I did well/wrong to improve, but this senior dev never responds to emails, never reviews my PRs, and the ones I have merged into the codebase after days of not hearing back never even get brought up again.

Basically, I know I sound like a broken record now, but it's just really frustrating that this happens. I've brought it up with other members of the team too and they all jokingly (with a tone of seriousness too) agree that he's never available. However, it seems that they all still EVENTUALLY get their problems resolved, but I can't help shake the feeling that he never gets to me since I'm just the new junior dev and my issues pale in comparison to everything else the others are working on. Doesn't help too that it seems like his reputation as an engineer is regarded highly by people both in and out of my project team.

Any advice on how to go about this without painting me in a bad light?",1,1636673266,430,2267
Offered what sounds like a bad job with good pay,"So I've been looking for a job for almost a year now. I finally got an offer but the company sounded really horrible as I read their offer letter. I have about a year and a half of work experience so I'm still very much a junior dev. The offer letter(well, email) included things like telling me that there were many junior devs and basically how the company would not pay much for my skills. Also, how most people leave anyway because they realise they hate dev work or the complexity of the work they do.  It was them basically saying I'm replaceable so they put me on a probation. The job itself sounds rigid with no room for mistakes or questions. I fee like these things are part of the development process. I try to avoid mistakes but questions will always come up. They literally said to not ask questions and if you do, you ask just once. They also expect me to hit the ground running with a contribution target for the first month. I feel like almost everything they said was what most companies are thinking but they don't word it that way. The email sounded really ""angry"". More of a ""enjoy the next 24 hours"" vs ""enjoy your day"" situation.


On the flip side, they didn't offer me the money I asked for but since I overasked,  the amount they settled on is my desired rate. Furthermore, this amount increases monthly and in a couple of months I'll be earning the amount I asked for and when they stop increasing it 4 months later, I will be earning way more than I thought I could earn with my experience. So basically the pay is good. Their company culture not so much. My offer letter felt like it was written by an angry employee who was leaving. It baffles me how the people who interviewed me have been there for 2+ and 5+ years. 

I am accepting the offer because I have no other options but I guess I wanted to see if anyone has been through a horrible job with great pay. My sister thinks I should take it, make my money, and leave. Also, it's remote so how bad could it possibly get? I'm just scared to be miserable for months and possibly, years. The company was okay on paper and during the interview, but now I'm concerned.

TLDR: I got a job offer for what sounds like a horrible job with great pay.",1,1636670917,419,2224

People have told me to familiarize myself with git, which I’ve done, but they’ve also said that my knowledge of python is almost useless for getting a job and won’t matter on an application or during and interview because it’s the only back end language I know, and that I should stick with JavaScript and the other front end languages. Obviously this is a much broader topic than I’ve laid out, but I’m just curious if it’s at all advantageous to know a back end language. Thanks in advance, everyone.",1,1636669789,134,765
Offers: Deloitte Cyber RFA Analyst vs EY CDP Technology Consultant,"Debating between these two offers, could use some help. I’m an engineering graduate, the comp is pretty much the same for both. My past internship experience is in software engineering and I’d like to stay close to software development. Ideally as much coding and exposure to different technologies as possible, I’ll probably exit into tech in a year or two. 

I really liked what the Deloitte partner had to say about possible placements for me. Development oriented projects or pen testing, things of that nature. My background is in development, not Cyber. I’m sure they have plenty of tools and internal/external development to work on? I hope that’s the case because I definitely don’t want to get sucked into monitoring and analysis or anything like that.

On the other hand EY won’t even tell you the sub group you’ll be placed in before accepting your offer. Some of the groups sound really interesting, but I honestly have no idea what they entail. The recruiter said there’s a need for engineers/programmers so I don’t need to worry about that skill going to waste. Is that true or am I gonna be pushing power points?

Finished my portfolio. Am I ready for my first job as front end developer?,"Hey everyone,

[I just finished my portfolio website](https://zachariejones.com/) and I'm trying to figure out if I'm ready for my first position as a web developer.

**So far I feel comfortable with the following:**

* **HTML**
* **CSS** (I love working with CSS)
* **JavaScript** (I feel like I have a good grasp on the fundamentals, but there's always more to learn)
* **React** (I've built about 4 or 5 small projects in react and 3 larger full sites in react, I feel fairly comfortable with state management, manipulating data from APIs, etc)
* **WordPress** (I've built at least 10 WordPress sites for various projects and at companies I've been at previously)
* **Shopify** (I used to run a small eCommerce business that was fairly successful (\~$30k in revenue - high ticket items)

**Things I've dabbled in and but I'm not 100% comfortable with:**

* **NodeJS/Express** (I've built a couple of APIs just from courses but nothing substantial)
* **NextJS** (I've used it in a couple of courses but no actual projects)
* **AWS/Digital Ocean/Google Cloud** (I've spun up a few servers for other projects but haven't done any real hosting -- I usually use something like Heroku or Netlify)

I know there's still a TON more for me to learn, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to even start applying yet. I've submitted a few applications but I was wondering if there was anything that I should be doing to stand out better.

Do you think my projects are up to the quality that's expected for an entry-level front end job? I'm currently working on other projects as well.

"Company asked for 2-3 supervisor references, last employer isn't a good reference, what do I do?"," I know for sure that I have one reference I can give that is a good reference from a past manager, I just need to contact him first.

The issue is, I was let go from my most recent job (I think it was related to us losing major clients), and I legitimately had no relationship with my most current manager. I actually had another manager before him, but both were in Spain and never talked to me besides our once-a-week team meeting which they usually skipped. I also don't think my last company's employees are even allowed to give out references so I am just not really sure what to do as this last position was my core related development experience. What should I do?

Also, I've been out of school for a while and wasn't close with my professors so that's not an option.

Which coding language would be recommendable for a beginner in the Computer Science field?,"Hello everyone!

An executive director just told the whole department that we are replaceable,"I am currently a software developer for a US based financial company, and have been there for about a year straight out of university. 

Just had a department meeting where the director for my department said that despite the holidays coming up, we must still ensure coverage throughout December, which is understandable as production issues can occur. But then he says, and I quote: 

""We work ***for*** the company, the company does not work for us. Everyone can be replaced. Keep this in mind when planning out vacations. We must all work hard and make sacrifices to be worthy of \[company name\]. But take your vacations as they will not be paid out or roll over next year"" 

I don't know why he even had to bring up the fact that we are dispensable, just leave it at ""make sure you are covered"".

 I get that we are all replaceable in some way, but never thought I would hear it so directly. I have already been casually looking around for new opportunities and this is motivating me to look harder.

Is this a red flag? None of my coworkers said anything after the meeting, and during the meeting call (about 100 people) no one said anything or reacted. I may be overreacting but this just rubbed me the wrong way.",1,1636664029,219,1220
Tips to nail behavioral portion?,"Hi guys!

"So, I discovered that my company is a bit... unstable.","So today I found out that half of our codebase was created by one person. We’ve been having a lot of issues with tasks not having descriptions or being extremely vague or no one having any idea what the merge criteria is. We have to keep deferring to our engineering a manger, (she’s great don’t get me wrong, she’s super helpful), because she’s the only one that knows what we’re supposed to be doing. She’s also completely bogged down and busy *because* of this so it’s really difficult to get in time with her to get the requirements. 

The company seems like it’s struggling to figure out how to adequately dole out tasks and we’ve gone through three different types of sprint methodologies. They haven’t asked us developers what should improve and we’re sort of being blamed for work not getting done despite finishing the tasks given to us. It also seems like if our engineering manager left the company, the company would be completely screwed. Also, 2/3 of the developers have worked at the company for less than a year and it seems like they may have hired a few too many of us (or not enough, I can’t really tell). So... it all feels very unstable and while I generally really like this job due to my coworkers and not feeling overworked, I’m starting to worry.

What is your opinion on switching careers from healthcare to CS?,"I am a 30yo female. I am an FNP and have been working for 3 years and I am already feeling burnout. When I was in undergrad, I took a C++ class and I loved it. My original dreams were to go into CS. Well, life threw me a few curve balls. I got an RN license at age 20yo from going through an AAS degree at the local community college out of necessity/poverty. I didn't like nursing and I wanted to go back for a bachelor's degree in CS, but my husband at the time died unexpectedly and I found him. I suffered from PTSD for a few years, so I think as a way to find out how to heal myself I went through a bachelor in nursing and bachelor in psychology program. I wanted to work in mental health and I didn't know there were PMHNP programs so I did FNP. I did get a job doing mental health and I've been doing it for 3 years, and I am so tired. I am starting a new job in family practice to get out of pure mental health so that may help but I am not convinced. I also have a hard time just listening to people talk and talk and was recently diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist, so that has started to make sense. I am wondering if I am thinking of a grass is greener situation with a career change. 

I am enrolled to start a BS in CS starting January 2022. I've been researching careers in CS a lot and I have friends that are programmers and some have ADHD, and they have told me that it is actually a popular career among those with ADHD. I feel like I have a lot of strengths, and I have always had a ""math brain"" and I picked up on C++ really fast, in fact I was only 1 of 2 people to pass the class (maybe a bad teacher, idk), but my strengths are not in listening to people talk for extended periods of time without me getting much of a turn to give my input day in and day out. I didn't understand how much of patient care would be just listening and listening. I thought there would be more chances for me to use my logical reasoning and help people and it wouldn't be all about keeping patients happy, but the for profit healthcare business creates these situations where patient reviews hold a lot of weight for reimbursement and business. I like to do things right and safe, but that doesn't make people happy (think people wanting unsafe levels of controlled substances). 

I just ranted for a bit, sorry.

I have a bachelor's in psychology with high GPA but I don't want to work in that field. It's just too stressful and depressing. I was rejected for a school psychology master's program, most likely due to lack of work/'real world' experience. It's been four years or so since I graduated.

Anyway, my question is--do work at home, on demand computer science jobs exist, and would it be feasible for me to hold such a job with my disability? Such as, do I have the choice to work or not work depending on how I am functioning that day or week? Or could I do a part-time job?

I live in an area with high demand for jobs like this (Northwest Arkansas, Walmart HQ) but I don't know if jobs like these even exist. Any and all advice is appreciated.

Thank you.",1,1636661069,250,1378
[US - Chicago] What to do about salary given persisting high inflation?,"**Hello friends!** 

I wonder if anyone else has given serious thought to an approach for dealing with [inflation](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), and our current salaries in  IT. Maybe there's a big gap in my thinking here, but if inflation keeps at its current pace, what once was a decent salary is now diminishing over a short time horizon. From what I am seeing/hearing from recruiters and [surveys](https://www.idginsiderpro.com/article/3607982/it-salary-survey-2021-compensation-holds-steady-despite-pandemic.html), offered salary ranges are trending upward to contend with the inflated dollar and increased demand. Some approaches that came to mind:   


* Find a new opportunity, better salary | Level of difficulty: Not hard 
* Renegotiate salary, title, position, etc| Level of difficulty: Almost impossible with most organizations 

The leverage is on the side of the experienced IT Professional given the shortage of talent and the increasing need for organizations to move workloads to the cloud, modernizing legacy applications, and deploying more and more advanced tools to achieve organizational goals. That said, I've only heard of and seen organizations matching offers for folks looking to take other opportunities elsewhere (the consensus being accepting counter offers as [not good overall](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140619114149-115601827-career-mistakes-1-never-accept-counter-offers-after-you-resign)).   


The goal of this post is to encourage discussion/dialogue on different approaches in dealing with the impact of inflation on our salaries. I am eager to read your thoughtful and meaningful contributions!",1,1636659686,220,1658
Burnt out for a third time. Feels like this industry is just not for me.,"Started my career at abusive, underpaid startups. Burned out. Went back into it after taking a year off and lying in bed. Burned out again. Been in FAANG for the past few years earning absurdly more for doing absurdly less and being more miserable than before, but the health benefits are good so I stick around.

Am I just in the wrong field? The wrong company? The wrong city? My professional network are all people who struggled with the same problems as me except they know when to quit or have better WLB.

Therapy doesn't help. I don't have reliable family. I feel trapped by not knowing what other paths there are for me to follow. I don't know what lifestyles are available to me.

"Three Months as a Fullstack Developer, Shitty Team Lead With No Sign of Changing","Hi all,

So my girlfriend is a new grad and has been working at her first job as a Fullstack Developer for almost 3 months now.

It's pretty clear now that her team lead is just awful, partly because they're fully remote, her team lead thinks that she slacks off even though she worked extra hours to try and meet the deadlines, and throughout that period she didn't receive any help or guidance from her whatsoever. Tells her things like ""your being paid each month to do your job"" etc... 

Suggestions on what to do? Should she start looking for a new job? If so, how should she answer if asked why she's leaving her current position even though she's only three months in? 

Thanks",1,1636659046,123,684
I've been browsing this sub for the last month and here's the questions I still have,"First off I want to give you the position I'm in. I'm a college dropout currently sludging through the service industry. I want to make a shift into the tech industry without going into debt and making a somewhat decent living with a useful skill that I'm genuinely interested in learning.

Here's what I think I know. 

It's not some get rich quick scheme or an easy way to make money. It takes hard work and dedication and my expectations have been thoroughly grounded.

It's possible to get into without a degree. But just because a degree isn't necessarily required doesn't mean it's easy and I'm going to be competing with people who do have some sort of certification and experience making the journey even harder. That being, said I'm open to any cheaper alternatives to learning and certification.

Coding isn't necessarily about which or how many languages you know but rather your ability to effectively use your toolset to solve certain problems or complete certain tasks. At least I think so.

Communication skills are important. Being able to effectively communicate with people you're working with is an essential skill in coding. I'm not gonna be locked up in my room typing away by myself forever. As someone who's spent the better part of a decade serving tables I'd like to think not only are my people skills up to post but I like to believe my ability to translate my knowledge to make it more easily digestible is also pretty good.

There is no guarantee. There have been many people before and will be many people after myself who've taken this journey only to either quit or be massively disappointed by what was waiting for them. 

All this being said I still want to pursue this and this place is currently the best resource I have for granular knowledge about the subject so here's the questions I have.

What are the specific machinations of the jobs in certain areas of coding? I know this is a loaded question so I'll try my best to clarify. For example if you're developing an app on a team what would your day to day look like? What assignments would you be given? You don't have to stick to my example I'm interested in what the actual desk work is like across as many different areas as possible.

What in your opinion would be the best resource for starting? I'm leaning heavily towards starting with Java and using that as a base for learning C++. I personally wouldn't mind venturing into video games or app related jobs and C++ seems to be a good choice for either. If I'm wrong what would you recommend?

Are there any places that offer classes and certifications on par with a degree? I know bootcamps are an option but from what I can tell they get pretty expensive as well and a lot of people here seem to have a ""it helps but it's not everything"" attitude towards it. Would you recommend bootcamps as an alternative to school?

And lastly, realistically how much could someone like myself expect to make if we assume everything goes right? Again another loaded question that depends on a variety of factors but I really just want to know if I live as conservatively as possible as a single person with no kids would I at least be able to pay my bills without worry? 

In the end I'm looking for an industry where I can fully apply myself towards something Im actually interested in and keep my head above water. I don't care if it takes my l me 20 years I've set my mind to this journey and I will achieve it.

Thanks in advance for any advice or information. I appreciate all input.",1,1636658921,624,3525
Mechanical Engineer considering transition to software engineering.,"I'm a young mechanical engineer (23M). Graduated with an ME degree in 2020, and immediately started working at a firm making \~70k now in the Phoenix area.   


I've always wanted to do some coding and recently I've been thinking about the possibility of transitioning to software development (1-1.5 years from now). I've also heard there's a huge potential for income growth, which is a plus. Has anyone else made this switch recently and how did it go?

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to have a remote job if it were available, since the idea of relocation is tough (wife, 1yo baby, house), or something in the area if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

To start this, I've looked into many bootcamps and courses and I think I will start with something free (Odin Project or Free Code Camp) and if I decide I like it enough to make it a career, in like 6 months or so, I can decided to do a paid bootcamp or some sort of ISA program, if it's recommended. I plan on this taking a year to transition since I don't have a ton of free time to invest because of my current work, wife, baby care, and other things that happen in life. It would be some weekday nights/weekends when possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another point of contention is income. I know that switching careers can potentially lead to an initial income decrease until I gain experience/switch to a different, higher paying position. Unfortunately we are not really in a position to afford a decrease in income, as my wife is a SAHM. I would try to pursue a job paying at least the same amount, if not more than I currently make. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have any other mechanical engineers recently made the switch to software and if so, what was your experience like? What was your income before/after the switch, and what did you use to make the switch? Thanks!",1,1636658597,317,1802
What if we created an open game dev workspace?,"It's heartbreaking to see how many capable and hard-working developers are trying to go about the journey of becoming a game developer all on their own. I keep meeting people who are totally burned out trying to learn a new engine, a new programming language or even sometimes their first programming language in all on their own.

What if we created a workspace where we could build and encourage one another? Like a voice chat where you don't *HAVE TO* chat but rather just chill and work together with some soft music playing.

If you need help, there are others right there.

Shall we make such a thing?

I will [setup a Discord](https://discord.gg/fUfBkhxhTq). If 20 people join in, I will go ahead and promise that at least for the next 2 months I am going to have people there daily working and chilling. You guys down?

Rebooting My Career,"Background: 

Bachelor of Science Major in Computer Science from top Canadian university, graduated in 2013.

As part of my degree, worked Co-op as an IT Technician for 8 months and as a QA Analyst for 8 months. Both for medium-large companies. 

Attempted to start a mobile app development studio in the USA on using funds from my internships. This was from 2014-2019. I was the sole developer. I became a skilled full-stack mobile developer during this time and now proficient working with PostgreSQL, AWS, Swift, Node.js, Redis.

The app is functional and works great but lacks any significant user base. It heavily relied on restaurants and the pandemic destroyed any possibility of growth.

"Making a lateral move with paycut, is it worth it. Have you taken a paycut for a role?","I've been working as a software engineer for over 4 years. 2 years were working in data engineering. 2+ years working on the frontend, and this is what I do at my current job.

I only learn while working and don't really like to spend time outside of work programming. I like to relax outside of my work hours and recharge

Because of this, I don't grow that fast and I really only grow from whatever I build at work. I don't really enjoy frontend so I'm looking to make a move towards a more full-stack role or backend role.

I recently interviewed with 2 companies.

One is an early startup and seems like they are highly focused on producing work, so it'll be a grind. After interviewing with them, they have expressed interest and I'm waiting on their offer. It will be a full-stack role with a lot of plans for backend projects.

The other company is a later stage startup and would be a backend role. They have given me an offer that is $20k lower than what I make now. Their medical benefits are also not as great as what I get at my current work, and they don't offer a 401k match. They offered $22k equity with 4-year vesting schedule, but these are options to buy). They offer 3 weeks PTO. Full remote. Team seemed great and super knowledgeable

My current company, I get unlimited vacation but I don't really use up much vacation time, so fixed PTO seems better for me. I will be expected to go back into the office next year (we were remote during covid only). Frontend only role. Great medical benefits. I have no serious medical conditions.

Just looking at it financially, it just doesn't make sense to make this move. But, given my lack of knowledge in backend and my desire to fill that gap, I'm very interested in the opportunity. The engineers I met at both companies have been great and seemed knowledgeable. The early startup will be hiring me as a mid/senior level, whereas the later stage startup is actually hiring me as a junior. Not sure how I got offers at both these companies at such a varying level, but that is how it has ended up.

What are things I can do to transition from Tech Support Engineer to SE?,"I have my degree in CS with almost my masters in CS.

However, this is not where I want to be long term as I don't enjoy it as much as software engineering and the career growth is limited. I also don't have a ton of free time now that I am working to be searching/interviewing/etc.

I was thinking some good things to do would be focus on database/scripting/etc as much as possible in this new role so I can still gain on those. Was also considering doing a side project in my free time with Java/Spring and could add it to projects during this time. Would it be bad idea to list my resume job title in this role as SE and list tasks that I do here related to SE? They wan't me to learn their software in and out so I can help troubleshoot it with customers, but this is not really a transferrable skill. If I was learning Java/DB/etc I would be more motivated because its a long term transferrable skill.

FAANG jobs are just tough to get, period, much less for someone old like me, and I get the sense that start ups prefer younger/hipper devs.  But that's just what I gather.  I defer to you guys.  You know a lot more about it than I do.  Also, is it a good idea to begin learning a programming language based on where you want to work?  Example, if working at Netflix is your dream job, should you begin your coding education learning Python (since Netflix uses Python)?",1,1636645764,155,765

Red flags for a staffing firm?,"I one day when feeling bad about my ridiculously bad compensation and poor outlook for getting a raise decided to update my resume and just... see what's out there. I wasn't very popular last year when I had only a degree and no experience. I've got almost 6 months experience now and the job shortage is even worse, so maybe something will happen. At the very least, boost my ego. I go ahead and fill out a single indeed application. the next morning, not 12 hours later, I have a phone call from the company I applied to. It was literally the first job on indeed. I wasn't REALLY considering switching, at least until my work refused my raise. But I entertained it.

It was an american man (I'm sorry to sound prejudice, I understand that indian people make up a gigantic part of the tech world, but i get 200 emails a day from indian startups, so even if its incorrect, american recruiters give me some sense of legitimacy) and he said his staffing firm is currently staffing for a large famous pharmaceutical company.

Before I go further, I want to say that this staffing firm is Called StarsHr. I cannot find ANY real reviews about them other than their own website and socials. I see there's an entry for them on the BBB but its not filled out.

The large pharmaceutical company bought a smaller medical company some years back thats about 10 miles from where I live (I looked it up and that is correct). They are staffing software developers to help with ""automated dye injection tech"" whatever that means. Speaking to the recruiter, things went well, and he said he would be sending me some emails.

I got the emails, the staffing firm would be my employer, the contract is 1 year but that this particular client almost always hired people on. It offers benefits (maybe SLIGHTLY worse than my current ones, but acceptable, including dental). Most importantly, he asked how much I hoped to make. I probably would have told him a better number, but I at the time wasn't really considering the offer. I said I have to make more than 65k. To which he was very surprised I was making less than that currently (lol).

He said that he had to have me fill out of letter of exclusivity per this client's rules (the pharmaceutical company, not the staffing company). It was a standard boiler plate guidant global letter of exclusivity. I read the whole thing every word, its scope is only for this one company, and only for the one position ID (i made sure to check out the listing on guidant global and the position is real. I know scammers often find real positions, but at the very least its a real position).

I had never done a letter of exclusivity before, and I looked it up. apparently a lot of employers who use staffing companies do it so that they don't have the same candidate applying to the same position from like 15 agencies.

He emailed me today asking if I could do an interview on friday. I said sure, what kind of interview? Technical with coding/whiteboarding or a behavior interview. He said it would be with their hiring manager (who's name he gave me, I looked up him, he's on linked in as someone working for that pharmaceutical company) and would be just basic ones about my qualifications, then later we would do a MS teams interview with a panel and some coding.

He emailed me a few hours later to say he was mistaken, they're going to forego the phone screening and behavior part and its going to be the MS teams meeting on friday. Panel of 4. The hiring manager, his team lead, and people on the team who were previously from the same staffing company but are now full time there.

He said the staffing company president wants to talk to me tomorrow on the phone and give me a ""more detailed pre-interview briefing"". That... was weird to me.

So for starters, does anything jump out at you. Anything look like a red flag. Second, if not, what red flags should I look out for? Anything I definitely should never do or ever sign? And lastly, have you EVER heard of starsHR? All the people named have linkedin accounts with robust activity, hundreds of connections at real companies, several endorsements. Just seems like a scam for some reason",1,1636645011,742,4171

Should I still keep pursuing the CS minor or just self study?,"For context: I’m an EE major who decided to pursue a CS minor cause I enjoyed programming and wanted to learn some CS skills that can help complement my major.

I have already taken the two intro courses and discrete math. I’m currently taking data structures and the course is kind of disorganized to say the least. The assignments have been kind of vague and it’ll take some time before someone gets to your question. I don’t think it also helps that there are about &gt;200 students from two sections and about a little more than 10 TA’s and 1 instructor. It also kind of sucks that we don’t have enough practice doing problems that apply concepts that we learned in lecture.

I realize the nature of this class tends to be difficult, but I didn’t realize it was going to be this chaotic. I want to keep trying if learning this stuff is much harder to learn on my own since I’m already doing a fair amount of self studying for this class as it is.

I guess what I’m asking is if it’s worth it to just keep trying and sticking with the CS minor or if I would be fine off to self study? I am expected to graduate this Spring and will only need to take two more electives once I pass this course.",1,1636644489,225,1196

I want to study cybersecurity but I have no knowledge in programming and coding will I learn about it when I enter university?," 

I graduated from highschool last year and finished highschool in a third world country and looking to study aboard and will be studying in 3/4 months and I searched about what to study etc and at first I looked into engineering but after researching about it and finding its all about math I decided it's not for me, what I found interesting was cybersecurity but the problem is I have no knowledge in programming or coding, one of my friends who is now studying it told me its a great career choice, when I was studying in school they really didn't teach us anything my classmates just took the computer science class as a joke and didn't bother paying attention to the teacher and the teacher didn't bother to teach us he would just come to class and browse on his phone and yes that was for the whole years of my highschool so I didn't really get to know about coding and programming.

So now if I want to study cybersecurity without knowledge in programming or coding will I be fine, I have no problem using youtube and other sources if I didn't understand while attending the university

That being said I have no problem with hard working and learning and attending my classes and trying to understand and even using youtube videos to help me out and other sources, what I'm scared and worried about is what if the teacher just assume we already have the knowledge or basic knowledge for what he is about to teach, if he went step by step from the start then thats good.",1,1636643348,270,1479

I recently started my first real job since graduating as a Tech Consultant at a big-4 accounting firm and I absolutely hate it.

I'm struggling to find my way...

I started developing for personal fun a few years back. Nothing fancy, just some web stuff. Actually, it made me really frustrated and I quit for a while (a bad habit of mine that it took nearly 25 years to break...) but I've gotten... Decent at it. I can do backend stuff with my eyes closed and I hate frontend with a burning passion.

To me, programming is more computational than some JavaScript web framework, CSS or some basic CRUD database access... It's number crunching, algorithms, it's figuring out how to best use the hardware you have in front of you to accomplish some task that barely fits in the available parameters.

These kinds of things get me excited. Have any of you ready about RICE university's SLIDE algorithm? It's a neural network that beats the same size network run on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 on a CPU! That's nuts!

Anyways, not much I come across excites me except for the idea of these technologies that I have no use for. I'm like a walking solution with no problem, and it's really kicking my ass lately. I can't stick with a programming language, a project, or anything because, well, the things I want to build and work on I just simply don't have a use for. Part of this is likely depression and my lack of going out and enjoying life so I have nothing to apply my development to, but damn, it's hard battling those two opposing things at once.

I've come here for advice, not to whine, which I've already failed at (look at me go!). I'm looking for help figuring out what direction to take. What thing could I study or look into, what problems can I work on that incorporate my TRUE interests *(high performance computing, parallelism, clusters, super computers, just flat out burning hardware at the highest temp it will go and utilizing as many resources as possible at once. I like BIG stuff that I simply don't have access to*), but also without going to get a master's degree in something I don't *actually* want to study? I can develop neural networks, sure, I could explore data analysis and other ML algorithms, I could probably build image classifiers from scratch. Hell, I could even save up and build a full on Beowulf cluster out of NVIDIA Jetson Nanos and run all of these projects on them, but the sad truth is, all of that is useless and incredibly non-driving if you don't have something to apply it to, which I don't...

I'm just lost, and looking for someone who will actually read this post and offer some real, actionable and thought out suggestions.",1,1636640699,454,2734

**Starting as a Junior .NET Developer**

In november 2020 I got the opportunity to start at a big firm as a Junior .NET Developer within a team that focused on implementing, extending and customizing MS Dynamics Connected Engagement applications (Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, Project Operations...). Not exactly knowing what I was really jumping into I can definitely say the first +-6 months were an insane rollercoaster where I had to absorb an insane amount of information (eg. getting to know inhouse backend and frontend frameworks, D365 CE in's en out's, Power Platform, Azure services, DevOps...). During those first few months I mainly gained experience during the onboarding process (internal and external training), acquiring PL-100 and PL-400 certificates, performing technical work related to D365 projects in final build or existing support mode etc.

In May 2021 it got more exciting as I got the opportunity to work on an entirely new and big project where the technical lead and myself were the only ones being assigned to perform the technical implementation/customization from scratch. Although having to set up everything from scratch was very exciting as I had only worked on existing projects until now, unfortunately this project never really got up to speed. Decisions on our client's side took ages and even though there should've been enough technical work for 3-3.5 days/week, I barely managed to fill 2 days/week for this particular project. To fill up the week I again had to rely on performing support or optimalisations for already existing projects, with some research every now and then. In September 2021 an internal audit at our client even resulted in the project being put on hold for an undetermined amount of time. This obviously resulted in my agenda being filled up entirely with external and internal support projects and optimalisations, until now.

&amp;#x200B;

**My current situation**

If I tell you that I'm in my 20's, very ambitious and (sometimes too) skeptical about everything I spend my time on, you probably start thinking the story above is not ideal to give me enough fulfilment. Although my job title officially states 'Software Engineer', I really don't feel like I've been 'engineering' a lot of advanced software at all during the last 6 months even though I've gotten a lot more responsibilities. Obviously this has to do with gaining more experience and everyday tasks becoming part of your comfort zone. During this 1st year I've written hundreds of plug-ins, custom Actions, custom API's, extended/optimized our frontend Javascript framework, worked with Power Platform and solutions ALM, Azure Webjobs, Service Busses etc. But as the weeks progress I'm feeling more and more like a configurator than an actual developer/engineer...

The problem right now is that I'm trying to identify what's causing this lack of fulfilment and what my next step should be. As fortune telling from a glass sphere is still pretty unreliant today I'd like to reach out to you guys who might've been in the same situation or have (brutally honest) opinions ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**My concerns**

* I'm aware working as an employee at my current company results in my team and I having to rely on clients with a support contract or acquiring new clients/projects to be able to perform actual technical work. However, looking at my current weekly agenda and the current state of the sales pipeline, this doesn't bode very well for a future change of the situation. A logical move would be to look for another company within the same role, but that brings me to my next concern.
* Everybody knows 99% of the time during an application process people of HR and Business will try to sugarcoat whatever you're looking for in a company. I've been in some non-binding conversations with other companies and obviously they all have ""big and very exciting projects"". Assuming this might be true, this sparkles the following thought: will another technical D365 CE software engineering job be sufficient to support my technical growth?
* Although I'm sufficiently self-aware to realize I still have a lot to learn regarding Power Platform / D365 Development, it feels like all the ""hard work"" is already done for you and you're somewhat trapped in the D365 ""cage"". A big part of the job consists of getting to know all the in's &amp; out's, quirks, out-of-the (sometimes black) box processes MS provides and finding a way to deal with them. This particular feeling might be caused by the lack of projects or how solutions are designed and build at my current company, but I'm also thinking about potentially leaving this ""cage"" and start looking for more general software engineering jobs to get more experience with .NET Development, frontend JS frameworks, databases, design patterns...

In the end, this post quickly grew out of the proportions I initially had in mind. But I feel like the entire scope is required to fully understand my current situation. I'm really looking forward to some of your feedback and at the same time hope to maybe inspire other fellow juniors! :)",1,1636638355,910,5619

Senior who had previously left the company left us with a mess of code with no comments or documentation.,"I am now working in a startup company, and the main project of the company had always been handled by my senior.

Then he left without a long notice period, like only 1 or 2 weeks. Within those weeks, he managed to create a very general documentation (high level view) that only describe the flow of the project.

Now I took over his task to migrate from iOS mobile app to MacOS desktop app. But looking at his code really killed my motivation, a lot of unused code was commented, yet there are no useful comments to describe his code.

I feel like my passion is degrading while working on this project and keep delaying my tasks. But at the same time, when my other Flutter project has something that needs improvement, I am relatively more motivated to work on my task.

Career stability of Compiler Developer jobs vs Network Developer jobs?,"I am a 4th year engineering student in Canada, and I am trying to decide between 2 full-time offers and I am feeling a little lost. Any advice or insight would be appreciated! For background, I have gotten a few internships in embedded development and an interest in real-time systems. I like that work but I also am early in my career and open to pursuing other fields of software development later on, depending on the interest and salary and stability of those fields.

Job 1 is an entry level network developer position at a recognizable name in Ottawa, Canada. The job is mostly C development (and usually python for tools/scripting) and the domain of the team is the routing and forwarding information bases for all networking device products that the company produces. It involves writing code in the company's proprietary RTOS.

Job 2 is a junior compiler developer for a recognizable name in Markham, Canada. It involves coding and maintaining the common code of a few back-end optimizing compilers. The compiler is proprietary, and compiles a few of the company's internal languages (and cobol), though our section of the code only deals with the intermediate representation of that code and generates the final optimized binaries.

Both jobs pay the same (just shy of 100k CAD/year, feel free to comment on what you think of that salary for a new grad in Canada also), and I could see myself being happy with both jobs. I am interested in both networking and compilers, although I will have taken two networking courses and zero (not by choice) compilers courses by the time I graduate. The locations are both good for me, too, since I have personal connections to both Toronto and Ottawa.

In particular I am curious what people think of the long-term stability of each field? Or transferrable skills, etc, of each job. I don't want to get stuck holding the bag with few transferrable skills a few years down the line. If you had to choose one of these jobs to start your career in 2021, which would it be and why?

Thanks very much!",1,1636636128,350,2045
Looking for career advice,"I’ve been working as a software developer over 12 years and currently based in Sydney.  I’ve been in a lead capacity for half of that but I decided recently to take a new job as an individual contributor (sr software engineer).

I don't even know what I want to specialize in, or field I want to work in later on. 

I don't need a FAANG career...  All I really want is to eventually land a decent paying, remote position, where I can do my work, get paid, the end...and I'm willing to wait for the right opportunity...but do they exist...for me?

I'm a mom and quite an introvert and at this point, I've decided to lean into my limits and personality traits instead of fighting them anymore.  My strengths are that I'm smart, organized and can learn things easily.  

But after reading through this sub I'm now doubting everything.

TLDR:

Sorry this is a bit all over the place; my questions are:

1.  Any career changers over 40?  Can you share your story?
2. Are there remote jobs for a BSSW grad where you can just...do the work and get paid?
3. Is anyone else overwhelmed here?
4. Any suggestions on a field where you are likely to be able to be remote and just log in, do work, go home?
5. Any tips, thoughts?

Please be kind and thanks!",1,1636635587,307,1766
Am I being dragged along?,"A recruiter reached out about a job that I thought sounded interesting about 2 months ago and I've been interviewing since. After the tech screen and the Hiring Manager interview, they thought I wouldn't be a good fit for that specific role but had a new posting coming along and they thought I would be a great fit there. I wouldn't need to do any of the screening again, just join at the final portion of the interview process.

So I waited a few weeks for the new role to be posted internally then externally. I did the final round of interviews and had a pretty good time. I talked with the recruiter after the day is over and she says that they have a diverse talent hiring pipeline and need to interview a certain number of diverse candidates before they can make an offer (I'm a white male)... Since I was the first to go, it'll be a few weeks minimum.

Two days later, I have the recruiter wanting to set up a phone call with me. They said that the interview panel unanimously agreed that they should hire me, but they have to get through the pipeline first. It also sounds like there's a new role opening up at the same level, in the same department, but on another team. The hiring manager thinks I would also be a good fit there as well. Essentially, it sounds like they want to hire me but can't at the moment and can't guarantee anything because they still have to interview a certain number of candidates.

All of the glassdoor reviews about his company's hiring process are great, so I don't think they are trying to screw me over somehow. But I'm curious to know if anyone has been in a similar situation? Do you think the company is just stringing me a long? I feel like they wouldn't call to tell me that they wanted to hire me if they didn't feel confident that they would eventually be able to.",1,1636635507,337,1814

Reaching recruiter after one week from first contact,"Hi,

Last week a recruiter from a company I'm interested in reached out to me and said my profile was a fit for a backend role that she had for this company.

It could've been one of those many cases where a recruiter reaches out with opportunity that has nothing to do with your actual experience, but that wasn't the case. From past job offers that I've seen from that company, I know that I'm a pretty good fit in terms of tech stack and values. Also, a guy who used to work with me , and with who I have a very good relationship, moved to this company 6 months ago and now agrees that I'd be a perfect fit for the role. So, I'm pretty confident that my experience would be valuable for this company.

The thing is that I had a call on Thursday, last week, with the recruiter about the position and it went pretty well. I think that it was clear that my experience was pretty well aligned with what this company is looking for. We talked a bit about the company, the interview process, as well as about my previous experience and motivation to move on. Finally, the recruiter gave me positive feedback about the call, and said that she'd pass my profile on to the actual team following Friday (6 days ago) and that I'd have news the following week.

It's been 7 days from that call and 6 days from the day she passed my resume on to the team, but I haven't had any news yet.

What should I do about it? Should I reach the recruiter politely and ask for an update?  I'm not feeling like letting the time pass and ""see what happens"" since I'm on vacation for 2 weeks so it would be a perfect moment to start the actual interview process. Also I'm very interested in this company and role, so I want to make sure that I'm not ghosted. If I'm going to be rejected even before the interview process starts, I'd like to know why since it was apparently pretty clear that I was a fit, so agreed the recruiter.

What would be the best way to approach this situation?

Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.",1,1636635125,376,2004

What do you check about the company when you’re searching for a “foreign” remote job?,"So you know, there are now more remote jobs than ever. I’m probably wrong about this following notion but when I look for a job locally, I try to always go for mid-large sized startups/corporations for job security reasons (i.e hopefully it won’t go down 8 months after I join or that I won’t encounter issues with pay etc) and for the name prestige to hypothetically increase my job chances in the future

You see where I’m going with this, when I look for remote jobs in europe/US I always bump into relatively small companies. It’s two different unknown areas for me where I don’t know the company at all (like in another country) and it’s small in size.

The job I applied for seems a little sketchy,"I  know that the title seems vague, but please hear me out.  It's been several months since I've been out of work and I was desperate.  About  two weeks ago, I filled a job post on Indeed for a full stack developer  position near my area, and didn't think twice about it.  About a week  later, I got an email from them- this is the link: [https://imgur.com/a/Pqgd4wr](https://imgur.com/a/Pqgd4wr)

Notice  how the interview is short? I thought that was unusual for a company  because I never heard of an interview lasting only twenty minutes for  any job, especially for a position that's software related.  What was  even weirder was that even though they had a main website, they had next to no other online presence.  No LinkedIn profile, and no Glassdoor  account.  The only thing I could find was their Indeed profile that had  just one job review written back in 2017.  Nevertheless, I still  followed their instructions and filled out the rest of their application  (they asked me a bunch of personality questions and had me do a timed cognitive assessment).  Then, I scheduled for the interview on Wednesday  (today).

Flash forward to today,  and during the interview, I saw two guys were hosting the Zoom call.   One guy was part of HR, and the other guy did most of the talking.  The  guy who asked the questions seemed, for a lack of better terms,  unprepared and standoffish.  For the first 5 or 10 minutes of the call,  his eyes were glued to the screen reading something off (my guess was  that he was reading some pre-written questions) and asked when I  graduated even though I submitted my resume telling exactly when I  graduated.  He emphasized that I had a lot of work to pick up since I  was not used to their technology stack (it's PHP and Laravel).  When I  gave a lowball salary (since my only other work experience was not directly in software) he said he wanted to give me a lower salary for now since he  wants to know if I have the ability"" to pick up the frameworks quickly  enough, and then give me the salary I suggested. Another thing that he  mentioned that there were only three other members in the company that  were working on the tech stack, and that I would be the fourth.

Although  the company was very small (it apparently has less than 50 employees) I  thought it was very strange that there are only three individuals  working on the tech stack of the whole company, considering it seemed to  be a tech oriented firm.  Then he picked up the phone during the middle  of the interview and called one of their employees over.  When that guy  came, he just asked one or two questions on when I used Vue.js and how  big the project I have worked on previously were.  And that was it- they  never asked me a single coding question from Leetcode or Hackerrank.   Then the main guy came back and because it seemed that I ""was smart  enough"", he basically **hired me on the spot** and asked me when I could come.

Naturally,  because everything just seemed a little off, I got to ask some of my  questions, one of which was the company culture.  I remember that the  main guy gave a very vague answer on how it's centered on work and  collaboration.  I also found that to be strange since it seems that most  other firms seems to have a central motto on work or have a ""quirk"" in  them.

I just find the whole  experience very uneasy because I never had or heard of an interview that  lasted this short, nor did they even follow typical interview  guidelines you would normally see at other companies- everything seemed a  little impromptu.  In fact, when I asked the HR guy when I am going to  get the job offer letter in writing, he said that I am going to get it  tomorrow.  So here I am just confused as hell.  What do you  guys, especially you guys who work as software developers, think? What  in the world is going on here?",1,1636614260,763,3866

What helped me massively with all sorts of ailments from my 10 year programming career," 

Biggest thing that helped me my hand pain was these cheap ass gloves from amazon: [https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08PKL8GQY/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o03\_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08PKL8GQY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Not only do they keep my hands warmer but there's also a cushion between your fingers and the keyboard keys. Also one of the worst things I ever did to my hands was cheaping out on keyboards, I always buy premium keyboards nowadays and that helps loads too. Also keeping your hands warm when you're outside with some premium/expensive warm gloves help lots too, if you've got poor circulation like I do and coming home with your hands stiff from the cold the last thing you want to do is smash keys for 10 hours.

One thing that helped me immensely with wrist, shoulder, neck and back pain was a Herman Miller chair, they are definitely expensive but they have been 110% worth it for me, to me they are a no-brainer and I regret not buying one earlier than I did. I used to have one of those racer gaming chairs and they completely destroyed most of my upper body but since switching to a Herman Miller ergonomic chair I've had no wrist pain at all, no shoulder pain at all, no neck pain whatsoever. I have slight back pain still but it's been helped immensely by the chair.

Internship Choice question,"Hi everyone,

new reddit user-- literally created the account to ask this question. I am deciding between two internships and would love to hear everyone's thoughts &amp; advice, esp if you have experience in cybersecurity/transitioning from software development to security. 

about me: My plan is to transition from software to security at \*some\* point in my career, but I am really not sure about a few things:

1. Seems like sound dev skills are highly valued in the security space and the rest can be picked up on the job, so is it better to get a few years of experience in the industry before transitioning? I know this is only an internship, but I am a current junior and wants to have a solid game plan before graduation
2. I've worked at startups before and would love to experience a larger company, but not sure if the tradeoff is worth it
3. Thinking about grad school in computer systems/network, so there def might be more internships in the future. Not sure if the clout/higher pay from CompanyA is worth it, but it certainly is enticing

"Took a job I wasn’t crazy about, should I keep applying after only a week?","I am a 7 yr mechanical engineer transitioning to CS.  I got a BSCS and started my first CS-related job this week (it has some engineering elements, which helped me get it).  There are only a few people in my office and they have been great so far but I have a few issues with it:
- I’m the only one in my group (maybe most of the company) with computer science background/education.  I have been assigned a large project that I feel I have little guidance/help on.  I’m a bit concerned I don’t have adequate mentorship to develop my skills as I’d like.   
- I got a slight pay bump but the benefits are really expensive, so it comes out that I took slight pay cut after that. 
- old school company culture (not much PTO, full time in office, etc).  

All in all it’s not bad, but also not quite what I’m looking for.  Would it be looked down on if I applied for jobs elsewhere in this situation?   How do I explain the short tenure at the new job?",1,1636604804,191,947
Red Flags for a Staffing firm?,"I one day when feeling bad about my ridiculously bad compensation and poor outlook for getting a raise decided to update my resume and just... see what's out there. I wasn't very popular last year when I had only a degree and no experience. I've got almost 6 months experience now and the job shortage is even worse, so maybe something will happen. At the very least, boost my ego. I go ahead and fill out a single indeed application. the next morning, not 12 hours later, I have a phone call from the company I applied to. It was literally the first job on indeed. I wasn't REALLY considering switching, at least until my work refused my raise. But I entertained it. 

It was an american man (I'm sorry to sound prejudice, I understand that indian people make up a gigantic part of the tech world, but i get 200 emails a day from indian startups, so even if its incorrect, american recruiters give me some sense of legitimacy) and he said his staffing firm is currently staffing for a large famous pharmaceutical company. 

Before I go further, I want to say that this staffing firm is Called StarsHr. I cannot find ANY real reviews about them other than their own website and socials. I see there's an entry for them on the BBB but its not filled out. 

The large pharmaceutical company bought a smaller medical company some years back thats about 10 miles from where I live (I looked it up and that is correct). They are staffing software developers to help with ""automated dye injection tech"" whatever that means. Speaking to the recruiter, things went well, and he said he would be sending me some emails. 

I got the emails, the staffing firm would be my employer, the contract is 1 year but that this particular client almost always hired people on. It offers benefits (maybe SLIGHTLY worse than my current ones, but acceptable, including dental). Most importantly, he asked how much I hoped to make. I probably would have told him a better number, but I at the time wasn't really considering the offer. I said I have to make more than 65k. To which he was very surprised I was making less than that currently (lol). 

He said that he had to have me fill out of letter of exclusivity per this client's rules (the pharmaceutical company, not the staffing company). It was a standard boiler plate guidant global letter of exclusivity. I read the whole thing every word, its scope is only for this one company, and only for the one position ID (i made sure to check out the listing on guidant global and the position is real. I know scammers often find real positions, but at the very least its a real position). 

I had never done a letter of exclusivity before, and I looked it up. apparently a lot of employers who use staffing companies do it so that they don't have the same candidate applying to the same position from like 15 agencies. 

He emailed me today asking if I could do an interview on friday. I said sure, what kind of interview? Technical with coding/whiteboarding or a behavior interview. He said it would be with their hiring manager (who's name he gave me, I looked up him, he's on linked in as someone working for that pharmaceutical company) and would be just basic ones about my qualifications, then later we would do a MS teams interview with a panel and some coding. 

He emailed me a few hours later to say he was mistaken, they're going to forego the phone screening and behavior part and its going to be the MS teams meeting on friday. Panel of 4. The hiring manager, his team lead, and people on the team who were previously from the same staffing company but are now full time there. 

He said the staffing company president wants to talk to me tomorrow on the phone and give me a ""more detailed pre-interview briefing"". That... was weird to me. 

So for starters, does anything jump out at you. Anything look like a red flag. Second, if not, what red flags should I look out for? Anything I definitely should never do or ever sign? And lastly, have you EVER heard of starsHR? All the people named have linkedin accounts with robust activity, hundreds of connections at real companies, several endorsements. Just seems like a scam for some reason",1,1636604607,752,4181

Senior dev on our team keeps trying to push QA onto devs,"Lately, one of our devs has been advocating we help our dedicated QA team (every team has 2 dedicated QAs to the 5-6 devs). The expectation is we are assigned our own work full stories, need to shift to do QA for who knows what, then shift back to our work. 

At first, we helped where we could but it became more and more. We're given one days worth of time to test features/products manually because supposedly the QAs themselves do the rest, but now senior dev person wants us to write full suites of test cases too... so other devs said no or else give us more time to understand requirements/get domain knowledge? Dev person was quiet during this.

The convo w/SM leads to this not being a good use of our time because most devs are testing out of or lack domain/requirement knowledge where the QAs spend a good portion of their time understanding business requirements/needs etc. across the multiple products. The QA themselves have been silent for the most part of this ordeal too.

We're supposed to have a meeting next week to discuss this as a team, all the devs except the one openly expressed this is not productive to have devs  to do guess work on testing.

Just trying to get some opinions, anyone have this happen before? If we were full stack or everyone had to do this for their own work? I don't think this would be an issue. It's the case that each sprint, random people are just pulled to be QA for the sprint with very limited time.",1,1636599764,265,1454

Should I mention an internship where I did nothing?,"I did an internship about 2 months back. The title and even the certificate says Django Developer Intern.

I hate my programming job; Should I leave or give it time?,"Hey everyone, I'm 3 months into my first entry level job out of college as a technical consultant. I had basic Java experience from college, took a couple classes on it but was never particularly good (average at best). When I interviewed for my current job I made it clear that I'm not good at coding or scripting, and was told it would be a mix of scripting and client facing and that they would teach us scripting.

So now i'm currently at the job being ""taught"" javascript. Emphasis on ""taught"" because I'm completely lost and feeling like I made a HUGE mistake accepting a technical position vs the business positions I was offered previously. I watched YouTube videos to catch up too outside of work and I still don't really know what I'm doing, it's just not clicking and giving me anxiety.

Anyone have any advice on what to do?

Series A Start-up Offer,"Hi all,

I have a NYC series A start up offer as a fresh grad.

Offer details:

\- Base: 130k USD

\- Options: 0.05%, at a 45% discount 

They are currently in series A, valued at $60M, and plan to raise a series B at $200-300M valuation. Startup is a pure tech play, with about 2 M in ARR atm. Annual subscription basis. Backed by top VCs and execs in many of the tech firms we see today.

&amp;#x200B;

I've spoken to everyone within the team (size of 20) and they're great. However, the engineers at this start-up are relatively new, and I do have another offer (TC 120K, so \~10k lower if we discount options) who has better products and proven engineering expertise (code is mainly open source, so i can see their repos). The other offer is a safer option (larger entity) and has both good engineering growth and annual salary progression. However, it has already matured and does not have the same excitement a start-up brings.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone help me evaluate these offers and let me know things to consider? It is my first job out of college (discounting internships) and I want to make the right decision for myself.",1,1636595596,196,1135

"I hate being pressured to get a CS internship, so here’s how I got one in 3 weeks","**Context**: I feel like some context is needed. The uni I’m in makes internships so much of a big deal to the point of annoyance. So I took it upon myself to find one as soon as possible. BTW, **my focus is in gaming** since I want to get into game dev, but **ended up in telcomms for this internship.** 

**I know this is rushed and this isn’t for everyone to follow**. It’s still better to slowly build your side projects, get a good CV, and study for your interviews well. But I know there are some here like me who’s looking to get into an internship ASAP so it won’t stay an academic burden, so here’s what I’ve done:

1. **Online job listings are a godsend.** While it says “job listing,” a lot of companies also look for interns via these websites. You have to be patient with creating your profile but it’s worth it since you can use these sites when you look for actual work. Websites I joined where companies replied in a few days were:
   1. [**Leaderboard Jobs**](https://www.leaderboardjobs.com/?r=1). Their site focuses on gaming and they have dedicated pages for resources, seminars, and conferences. I recommend you get into a job listing site that is dedicated to or has a section for the particular industry you’re trying to pursue. 
   2. [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=Programming%20Intern&amp;location=United%20States&amp;geoId=103644278&amp;trk=public_jobs_jobs-search-bar_search-submit&amp;position=1&amp;pageNum=0). Being a professional hub, LinkedIn proved to be reliable to me. They have Easy Apply, so if you have a LinkedIn profile/resume set up, you can just apply in a few clicks. 
   3. [**Indeed**](https://www.indeed.com/q-Computer-Programming-Intern-jobs.html?vjk=c4ecdb0c2bf88de6)**.** I recently realized that they also have a lot of programming/CS internship roles open too. 
2. **Put your game face on.** And this is quite literally. One thing my professor told me that stuck with me is that professional life in CS is sorta like coding - problems are mostly solved when thinking outside the box. I realized this is the same when finding internships. Don’t hesitate to skip the textbook method of just waiting for emails and get yourself out there.
   1. Get ready to talk to a lot of people. I forced myself to get over my social anxiety if it meant trying to establish new connections in this 3 week period. I managed to talk to people I would never talk to unless needed. These included strangers like security personnel, front desk employees, professors, and even professionals I reached out to.
   2. Everything has a connection. Since you’re looking for a company that might look for CS internships, try to look for places nearby where your target companies might have a presence. 
   3. Go straight for the gold. If you discover a contact to a company via a job listing or announcements, don’t hesitate to reach out to them directly regarding internships. 
3. **Check your uni’s database.** It’s impossible for your uni or school not to have connections with other unis or companies related to CS, especially for your department. I discovered some companies to apply to by looking into:
   1. Try to check any recent seminars or conferences that a company held in your school. Chances are, your department officials might know how to reach out to the contact person there.
   2. Try to ask your professors if they have any connections regarding companies that might be interested in internships. This might be a shortcut, but it’s still worth the ask, right?
   3. Try to check what other universities are doing. Try to follow the above steps but with other schools. I discovered a handful of companies that did some talks in other schools nearby so I tried reaching out to them as well.
4. **Prepare the paperwork anyway.** It’s very likely that your internship will be remote. My internship will be remote. But one thing I did to be sure is to print out everything I’ve sent to the companies when applying. These include my CVs and cover letters and other requirements your school might need you to submit. Always have some thumb drives ready with some projects you can show interviewers. Relevant for the next stage.
5. **Personal visits still work.** If you’ve seen companies that offer internships that are nearby, don’t hesitate to make a visit. Remember, when you do, bring any COVID safety requirements if ready. This is important for the sake of anxiety, as you’ll want to make sure that your CV and cover letter reaches an actual person’s hands. Some pointers when visiting companies to give out your CVs/cover letters:
   1. Prepare an itinerary when visiting multiple places. If you’re commuting, it helps to have at least a proper sequence of companies to visit so you don’t get too stressed with your trip. The more companies you visit in a single visit, the better. 
   2. Ask for a contact person, be it an email or a mobile number. This lets you know who you’ll be expecting an email from.
6. **Prepare to settle.** Since I’m rushing the process, I removed any semblance of being able to choose where I get my internship. I can’t afford to choose when I’m focusing on getting one as soon as possible, so when the opportunity came, I took it and now I’m hoping for the best. I do have plans of taking another internship next year of my own accord, since I ended up in a telcomms and I really want to pursue gaming. 

I hope these tips help. I can’t share where I’ll be working because of an NDA. If you have other tips, please include them as well so we can help each other out. Thanks",1,1636589030,954,5577
[New Grad] How much am I stunting my growth and how soon should I leave?,"Hi all. I’m a recent comp sci grad from a large state university. I’ve been working for a company that I love - but I don’t feel like I’m doing any “real” development. 

I primarily work on ServiceNow, an application platform as a service that’s moving further towards low code, so while I do a lot of scripting and “application development”, I know that I’m not being exposed to the processes that would lead one to be qualified for more experienced software dev jobs outside of this particular platform. 

I am learning problem solving, agile, and translating business needs, so it’s like this is a complete waste of time, but when I develop an API I’m largely relying on their prebuilt tools to do the heavy lifting (as opposed to making a true backend with flask, etc.). 

Here’s my question: is 6 months too soon to begin looking for more traditional full stack junior web development type jobs? My current thought is that if I only want to do this for 2 years and transition to a more typical software dev role, the sooner the better, right?  

Basically, how stunted will my growth be and should I bail asap?",1,1636588801,200,1115

Is a career in cs worth considering for an applicant like me?,"I consider myself to be generally competent in a lot of tech but constantly feel like there isn't any way to prove it.

The projects I have on my resume are ones that I am incredibly proud of, but mostly related to games. I have little outside perspective on the quality of my work but I think I've done some novel things. I made a jigsaw puzzle game ([Jgsw](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627610/Jgsw/) on Steam) with custom shaders for rendering 5000+ detailed pieces with online multiplayer. I made a dithering post process tool ([QuickDither](https://github.com/Ooseykins/QuickDither) on GitHub) that leverages compute shaders to generate lookup textures. I started a trend for other vtuber software ([VtubeReflect](https://oose.itch.io/vtubereflect) on itch) that became a kind of minor sensation on twitter.

did I misrepresent myself to the recruiter?," I am currently a college student. This week, I have received an internship offer from this unnamed company.

So a little background: this internship posting has, as a basic requirement, ""needs at least x years of college"". When I first applied, I think I misunderstood the posting as ""by the start of this internship, you must have at least x yrs of college"".

Well, I'm graduating a year early and I have previously done approximately a year's worth of dual enrollment courses in the college I am currently attending. I also was wary of being rejected due to this, since in a different interview with a different company, I got rejected in the \*middle of an interview\* because the recruiter thought I didn't have enough schooling experience yet (as a result, I pretty much tried to avoid saying anything that suggested I wasn't actually a x-year).

But looking back, I think it meant \*this\* current year. I am a year below what they are requesting. Like I do believe I have the most of qualifications as detailed on the job description, aside from the fact that I am not a x-year or above. Nothing on my resume is misrepresented. I am actually graduating a year early, and my colleges classes are x-level.

Moved from Mainframe to Guidewire development. Should I ask for a raise?,"I’ve been a mainframe developer with my company for 3 1/2 year, 2 as a salaried employee. I received a very small increase after my first anniversary, but I haven’t heard anything since my most recent anniversary. The reason might be that I moved to a new team and role 2 months ago, and the last 4 weeks (overlapping my anniversary) I have been taking Guidewire classes.

My question is: should I ask for a raise? I’m incredibly new to this environment and the language. Also, I did not seek out the change, but was instead ‘selected’. I am aware that we are offering external candidates with little to no experience significantly more compensation than I am currently receiving. While I am excited for this new opportunity and I’m more than willing to put in the time and effort to become adept at it, I’d be lying if I didn’t say the lack of comparable compensation isn’t weighing on my mind.

I plan on possibly bringing this topic up in a week or two during my monthly meeting with my manager. I’d just like to get some input from y’all.

Switching from cybersecurity to development question,"First some background to my question, I graduated last December and well I got an opportunity to work with a teacher I had at school at a consulting company in cybersecurity because I really liked the pentesting part, I've been there since February of this year, and well I found out I didn't enjoy cybersecurity that much, I still enjoy hacking but I would rather do it on my time since there are a lot of reports and policies at this level, and the salary wasn't that good either. 

So, I enjoy coding as well and I'm starting to look for developer jobs like I'm C# since I have some projects under my belt there.

Would that cybersecurity experience help me in my search for developer jobs? Since I haven't yet been there a year would it be worth it to add it to my resume?
Would it be an easy switch? I haven't been coding in my security job mostly a lot of general tech stuff and lot of reports about everything imaginable.

Need Guidance - My struggle with Back-End Web Development and Improving,"I'm give up fellas! I don't know how its just not sticking to my brain but I'm struggling, always lost and annoying my coworkers with the constant hand-holding'. I'm feeling like I'm not cut out for this work and fooling myself. My question is how did you guys learn to be competent developers in the Back-End web dev? Also, what is your process in learning new concepts, integrations and technology stacks in a fast pace environment? I'm always clueless and petrified when something new is expected for me to complete when I have no prior experience to it.  


My company's focus is eCommerce and consultancy which includes development support work with other companies. I been working in BED for more than 3 years here and most of my experience has been working on CMS technology like AEM, working with .NET Web APIs and extensions for PIM systems. Despite all this, my skill set and knowledge feels more entry-level than junior developer. Each project I get transferred always has something new I never worked with and expected to implement alone and quickly. For example, I never worked with Middleware such as Boomi and how to set it up, I don't know how to create and utilize WSDL to work with SOAP, I don't know what Intershop is and have time to learn to work with it. Clueless in determining which web services is the best option for the task. The client's IT team explains the work criteria and then provide me an endpoint, and then it's up to me to make sense of something I feel is like walking in the dark.   


I feel like the root of the issues are: 

* I don't know what questions to ask and what is expected of me to already know
* I don't know if I have everything I need when the work is presented, this goes in hand with the first bullet point
* Not sure if I am cut out for this type of work, the overhead of incorporating new services and stacks is too complex and overbearing to understand
* I never know where to begin! I love programming, manipulating data and solving complex problems, but I have clearer understanding on what I need to do on that level  


I apologize for my long prose. I really love programming and I know I am meant to do something with it to contribute to the world in some shape or form. The Imposter syndrome feel less like a syndrome and more real. Any advice is appreciative and will set me in a more certain direction.",1,1636581110,435,2371

Should I look for software engineering positions for the Spring 2022?,"Here's my backstory. Due to what I found to be a competitive salary for an entry level software engineering position, I accepted a return offer that will take place starting July 2022. Around that time, I expected to do an accelerated masters program (in computer science obvs ;) ), where I would start my graduate courses in Spring of 2022, and after Fall 2021 finishes I'll completely fulfill my undergraduate requirements.

I had quite some time to ruminate on how the hell will I have a work-life balance if I'm juggling a full time job and full time graduate studies (required for the accelerated masters program), and ultimately decided that the program is not for me.

So that means I won't be taking any classes in Spring 2022, but my bachelors degree won't be conferred until the end of that semester since I had applied to graduate for that time (since it was required by the accelerated masters program to complete some graduate courses before conferral of bachelors degree).

More importantly, this means that I have a lot of spare time for Spring 2022 and I'd like to work in a position, ideally a computer programming/ software engineering position, in the time before July to not be bored and get some money rolling. I'm just unsure about whether I should look for positions because 1.) I'm not sure if I'll have enough time from now to then to get a position starting January; and 2.) I'm not sure about whether it'd look good or hurt my professional reputation to intentionally take a role only to quit it months later. 

I'd really like to know your thoughts and use them as potential guidance.

tl;dr: Accepted an entry level position for July 2022, but I have nothing to do for Spring 2022. Should I look for another position just for the meantime to get the money rolling?",1,1636580182,311,1793

Recruiter Having Me Apply to Higher Level Position,"So I am interviewing with some FAANG companies (or MAANG, now), and I had a phone screening this week with one of them.

I am sure this is a great thing to hear from a recruiter in a FAANG company, however I am nervous that the Level II on-site will be much more difficult and what happens if I don't perform to Level II standards there?

Is there still a possibility that I am offered Level I if my performance in the on-site isn't perfect? I am not sure if this is a double-edged sword by being moved to Level II interview.

Help! I need a better job title than the one I designated for my business.,"In 2011, I registered a research and development company and took on the title of “Control.” I have been working on this business off and on, working on several inventions and websites. I even took the role of project manager and oversaw a team of Vietnamese programmers; and later contracted a guy in Brazil for a separate project. In fact, I would literally take a portion of money, from the money I earned at my day jobs, and I would pay my employees overseas.

However, for all the in-house work that I have done, I have neglected to publish and patent my inventions. I'm literally sitting on a gold mine of different inventions and products that I have hidden away for a later date, because I don't have the funding necessary to launch them. I need money; and I am unwilling to hand my contributions to science and the economy to a third party, that can literally sink my business, because they don't like the business model or the direction the company is going. (I have overarching plans, so each invention and business serve a greater purpose than just amassing wealth.)

Anyway, I have plans to get funding on my own terms, but I now require a job to raise seed capital. I never included my business in my resume in the past, but a job recruiter is suggesting I add it to my resume. The thing is, my title of “Control” is not going to fly if I try to add it to my resume. I require a more appropriate job title.

Can one of you guys help me? Given the work that I claimed to have done in my business with regard to hiring people overseas, what is an appropriate job title to replace “Control.”

I would really like to be a developer. I want to design and build programs (possibly games, but I'll settle with websites).

It seems my choices are:

1. Just keep applying, eventually someone will hire me and I'll get my foot in the door.

"Struggling to cope and work with my manager at a ""start-up""","For the last 6 months since graduating from college I have been working at a small tech company on a new company project and team which very closely resembles that of a new start-up. Our team is very small and only consists of 3 devs, 1 tester/QA and my manager. All 3 devs (myself included) were all hired together fresh out of college and we started at the same time. 

My experience so far has been pretty positive. The company treats us well, we're paid a decent salary and it's been fun learning and working with new exciting technologies in a fairly relaxed work environment. 

However, after 6 months I've really started to grow to hate and struggle with my manager. This is his first ever management role, and personally I feel like that has reflected on his conduct and overall management of our project. The guy is a complete workaholic. He works non-stop to get things done and has absolutely no concept of the working day coming to an end or having free time after work or the weekends. He plays down the idea of doing unpaid overtime constantly, as if it's normal and we should always be doing it, and also never says no to the demands of the management team - no matter how unrealistic or unreasonable. As a result, the scope of our project has completely spiraled out of control, we've missed our first major deadline and now we're under pressure to meet the next deadline. 

I cannot stand working with a manager who is constantly expecting me to value my work more than my own life and health. For example, he previously got very angry and shouted at me after I told him that I didn't have time to go back and pick up an extremely minor task (as I was working on developing more important features assigned to me by him) - because according to him ""no time"" is not an acceptable answer - as we always have time. By this he is meaning I should have went home one evening and picked up that task or done it over the weekend on my own accord. He has no concept of the working day coming to an end and leaving your work at the door. 

Another example of this involves annual leave. If you book a holiday, no matter how far in advance, he pretty much always moans about it come the time actually take your holiday. As a result of his poor planning and time management he will approve the holidays, and then try to get myself and others to cancel them the week before. If you cancel them for him - he loves you, if you don't - you are pretty much treated like a criminal in the office until it blows over. 

Is this kind of behavior normal in this industry? I always knew there would be stressful times approaching deadlines where extra work might need to be put in to get things done, and was accepting/willing to do this upon reasonable request - but I really don't feel like it should be constant or that he should expect it from us rather than respectfully asking for a favor. If I knew more about him prior I definitely wouldn't have taken the job. Now I'm counting down the time until I've gained enough experience, hopefully next year, to move on to a better position at a bigger company where working conditions are better. 

I would appreciate any advice or comments anyone has for me on what I should do or how to cope with this kind of manager.",1,1636575808,607,3266

Evaluating different competitive offers for internship (finance and tech),"Hello, I am fortunate to have three good internship offers and I am looking for opinions on evaluating these offers.

1. Major US tech company for a ML/DS position (one of FB/APPLE/GOOGLE/MSFT/AMAZON). 
2. Major US Investment Bank for a quantitative finance position (one of JPM, GS, MS).
3. Proprietary Trading Firm that is not as well known for a quantitative position (One of Virtu, Optiver, SIG, Schonfeld, IMC)

For context I am a phd student from a big us university in a stem field. I have an interest in finance but also tech companies sound interesting. This is a first and potentially last internship for me so I want to make it count. Getting a return offer is nice but not a major consideration. 

In terms of compensation, the order is 1&lt;2&lt;&lt;3. However this is only an internship so I don't think this should be the primary consideration (although the compensation would still change my net worth considerably %-wise since I am a student). Benefits are also slightly better from 3 but other offers are competitive.

Since I don't have internship experience, I am looking for factors to look at for evaluating these offers. The companies in 3 are not as well known in general. I think all three internships are gonna be high quality. I have received more attention from 2 and 3. 1 is probably more indifferent as to if I join or not (which is logical as it is a huge organization).

Factors that count are: resume impact (getting interviews in the future with ease), stability, salary evolution in areas, growth/learning.

Which opportunity would be best for someone who wants to get into Software Engineering? Although both roles aren’t SWE, would it be easy to transition into it for full time? Which opportunity would be best? Which would look better on a resume? Any advice is appreciated.",1,1636572980,131,783

Advice when learning a new stack as a new-grad developer,"Hello, I'm currently working full time on a SaaS startup in Japan. I'm in my last year of uni still but they let me work full-time even before graduating. (Lost scholarship so gotta pay for school somehow)

Anyways, I joined about a month ago and been learning the stack little by little. They do React/TS for the frontend, and use Kotlin/Ktor for Backend, and GCP.

I'm pretty good at frontend stuff and React, but I never really got around to properly learning backend, and I never even touched Java or Kotlin. The tasks involving lots of backend are getting a bit hairy and I feel bad for asking my seniors too many questions when I know they're busy.

My question is, what advice do you have for new-grad (or not) SE's joining a new company, using a new stack?

Perhaps taking notes when learning something new? Reading other's PRs on GitHub and noting down the style and how they implement issues? (Maybe note down stuff with MD)

Studying while on company time?

Do you maybe have some books or courses specifically for my current stack that you can suggest?

It's getting a tiny bit stressful knowing that people can do the task that takes me a week in 2 hours yet they are so patient with me. 

Cheers and have a nice day!

Remote work week expectations?,"Hello all,

I'm considering going to undergrad for CS and had questions about remote work positions. My older brother and friends who are already established in the field work much less than the usual ~40 hours a week that I see people say in ""How much do you work"" threads. Is this common in remote environments? From my understanding, it seems that they only work as much as they need to finish their tickets and projects, and then go on about their lives. Sometimes they'll hit 7-8 hours, but most of the time, it seems more like 4-5. Is this something I can expect for a career in CS or am I looking at a biased sample? 

Questions I may be asked: 

Are you interested in CS? 
-Truthfully, there's nothing I've found that I'm interested enough in that I would want to do as a career, but I need to do something with your life. 

Have you tried career counseling?
-I have. Nothing has particularly piques my interest so I'd like to do something that lets me focus on myself and hobbies. CS is the main contender because I feel it will let me work less based on what I've seen. 

Would you be happy in CS if you had to work a typical 40 hour work week or more? 
-Most likely not. Most, but not all, of the appeal is the prospect of working less and having more time to myself. 

Thanks!",1,1636571882,241,1288
How to ask for an increment when seniors leaving ?,"
I was making 170k per month (the average for my exp is around 200-250k in my country) and on April I got an offer matched (offer was 240k) by my current company and increased my salary to 300k (which is higher than average). Today I got to know a senior (who has 1 more year exp than me was getting just getting 290k and both of seniors (including him) of our company is leaving. So team lead (who’ll be more into managing us and connecting our dev team with the foreign business team/company) had a chat with me and said that I’ll be taking their parts as well and I’ll be leading backend part of the project.

I’m wondering is it ok to ask for an increment since I’m getting more responsibilities. But since I’m already getting above market salary and got an increment just 6 months back, is it ok to ask ?
If so, how much can I ask for ? Like if you’re in this position how much would you ask ?

Tentative offer after failing LC challenge.,"Hi everyone.

So, for a little backstory, I’m a Software Engineer with about 10 years of experience. But only 4 are corporate work. The rest is in freelancing and contract work. Most of it in the .Net stack.

Recently (3 weeks or so), I decided to go back to corporate work and started applying for jobs.

One of the companies I applied to was a mid-sized, well established company. They did the pre screening and I have 2 technical interviews afterward.

The first interview started with basic questions ( describe a project you are proud of ), then a little of system design and finally a LC challenge.

I was average all around during the interview and failed the LC ( only about 80% of the test cases were correct )

The second tech interview was just system design. I think I did well for most of it. I had a good grasp of the concepts and applications.  But by the end, the interviewer started asking things I had no idea about.

I had no choice but to tell him I hadn’t heard of those technologies, ever before.

Fast forward to today, and I was extended a tentative offer ( I still have to go through a third interview with the technology lead before the official one ). 

It is not that great, at 10k a month, but the company works with many technologies, and I’m tempted to accept just so I can have hands-on experience with them.

I’m very confused right now, and don’t know what to expect from this fourth interview, or the job, honestly.

Anyway, TLDR: What just happened? I’m particularly interested in the insight of those who did interviews before. What would make you extend an offer for someone who failed in 2 interviews in a row?",1,1636571480,292,1649

How to transition from sales to dev without a formal degree?,"Tldr: resume is full of sales/biz dev positions,  I have informal programming experience but cant get hored.

Let me get the uncomfortable parts out of the way.
Im 33, have a basic associates degree and have always been in sales/biz dev, not because I like it, but because it was always easy since I was a teenager. So every position I have always had involves sales and I have ZERO professional experience as a developer.

At the same time, I do know how to code pretty damn well because I have been doing it on and off for the last 15 years; see below for projects/background.

I applied for 300+ developer jobs over the summer, had 6 interviews and no offers. Got a temporary job through a friend doing guess what.... Sales!

I live in the US and luckily our house is paid for so I dont need a high-paying job, $3k a month post tax would cover bills.

Should I do what others on reddit have done recently and make a semi-fake resume with lots of buzzwords to get past the screeners?

Should I inflate my resume by changing the roles I did at former employers?

How do I land my first development position without having done that as an official role?

Need help as every morning I despise getting up and selling people and only look forward to post work when I can code. 
Ty in advance for the responses.

Accidentally deposited rollover check into my personal account,"My company closed out my old 401k and I elected to have the $2,800 rolled over in full to my IRA without any taxes withheld.  I then also found out I was getting a bonus for around the nearly identical amount of money.

Unemployment Advice,"I have been working for my current employers for about 6.5 years. I began as a contractor, but they treated me like an employee for years. In fact, they referred to themselves as my ""boss"", insisted that I use a company e-mail address, introduced me as a staff member to clients, and so on. They were quite demanding and I really should have cut ties with them back then. And by quite demanding: When my daughter was born, they were outraged that the labor was not scheduled, and absolutely demanded that I not go to the hospital with my wife. They have demonstrated a callous attitude devoid of empathy over the years.

Whatever the case, I became an employee about 4 years ago. I figured, heck, if they were going to grind me like an employee, I might as well get benefits and a routine paycheck. It can be a nightmare working for them. Rarely does anyone last at this business. I'm always surprised if a new employee sticks around for more than a few months. The business is owned by two romantic partners who quite literally hide their relationship from even their own employees. But it adds a difficult dynamic, since they are everything: Owners, CEO, HR, management. Everything. 

One of them has an unpredictable temper and randomly gets very heated with me for no reason. I do extremely thorough work for them. I honestly don't know how they could ever replace me. The other owner is hands down the most unkind person I have ever worked with. They talk down to me whenever the opportunity arises. I have never been more insulted by a person in a work place in my life. I always ignore it, do my best to have a polite attitude, and carry on. Say there was an error with some work project, not due to my fault at all. Instead of determining how to tackle the situation as a team, this boss will unleash on me, explaining why they are so smart and how beside themselves they are about my work. It's truly outrageous.

We have to request vacation time four months in advance. They can't be bothered to schedule anything sooner than that. Mind you, these people go on luxury cruises and elaborate vacations regularly. I make it a habit to request all vacation time for the year around January. That way everything is on the books. I am pretty certain that almost every vacation day I have ever taken, they will not acknowledge until sometimes the night before. I will remind them about it a few weeks ahead of time, a few days beforehand, and so on. And it generally turns into me saying, ""Hey, so... Am I still taking that vacation day? I sort of made plans with my family, it would sure be good to know."" 

They schedule work without any respect for my time. It is common that they overbook projects, and it's beyond obvious to me that they don't sit down and figure out if it's physically possible for me to pull it off.

I'll be honest, I am getting really exhausted by this. I have left out mass amounts of details. As of this morning I can sense they are attempting to pull some serious power moves on me after I confronted them about some recent behavior of theirs. They are now demanding I do work over the weekend (when I am not scheduled to work). I was also approved of a vacation next week, and they are scheduling work for me to do then. Though I reminded them multiple times about the vacation this week.

What do I do here? I am concerned I will not qualify for unemployment if they fire me. I would very likely quit if I could could unemployment. I really need to take care of my family and am trying very hard to be mature about all of this. But this is misery far too often. I am located in the state of Oregon. I would much appreciate any positive thoughts. I feel trapped and under the mercy of two people who clearly take advantage of me.",0,1637254255,692,3762
Where does the interest in compound interest come from?,"This may be a stupid question but I feel like I’m missing a crucial piece of info when it comes to compound interest that’s preventing me from fully understanding.

Where does the “interest” in compound interest come from? And how do you take advantage of it.

In my head, interest is reinvesting the money made on an initial deposit. But for example if I buy 1 share of VTI and it grows 10% by next year and I contribute $100 per week, that’s not an example of compound interest right? I’m just shoving more money into the stock market and watching it increase in value. I’m not necessarily reinvesting my gains.

But with this logic wouldnt only dividends contribute to compound interest then since its actual gains that you made from the investment that you’re putting back into your the market to grow at the same rate as your initial investment?

I guess at the end of the day I’m not totally sure how to take advantage of compound interest. What am I missing here?",0,1637254028,171,970

Taking out money from trad. IRA to put into Roth IRA,"I had a traditional IRA with primerica and I recently discovered how terrible they are.

I want a second checking account. Which is the best option for me?,"Hi r/personalfinance. I want to preface by saying I am a fairly organized and on top my finances.

Mortgage Closing Questions,"Hello all!

Exciting time for me as I am a co-borrower on a mortgage with my mother. I'm still young but have a career starting and my own business starting up. We were supposed to close 11/16 and spoke with our attorney and lender as that was the date in the Closing Disclosure but we are now delayed until 11/23 due to a land survey not being conducted timely. 

Now those are the small details but the big detail is there was a change to my credit report where I did have to take on $1250 in debt with 2 new accounts due to some emergency circumstances. I have been paying them off but they just showed up on my credit report (my credit score is actually higher than when I first got pre-approved and clear to close). But now I am worried these inquiries will ruin the closing. My DTI ratio went from 7% to 9% from the monthly payments, I hope I am not screwed here as my mother has a clear cut clean credit and she accumulated more cash on hand to prepare for the home expenses (moving, repairs, etc.)

First time renting out space. I have a friend interested. Need landlord advice.,"My wife and I are splitting up and she is in the process of moving out. I can live there on my own, but I won't be able to safe any money anymore. Money would be very tight. Then, once my old-ass furnace finally croaks, I'll be in deep shit. My roof only has a few good years left in it, too. So, I have a spare bedroom to rent out and have a friend who is interested in moving out of his parents' place and into mine. Here are some details about the house...

\- 3 bed, 3 bath ranch, shared bathrooms, master bedroom and the spare he would be moving into are almost exactly the same size (\~300 sq. ft.). Spare bedroom will be unfurnished.

\- Mortgage: \~$1300/month

\- Square footage: 1302

\- Monthly utilities (liberal estimates)...

Electric: \~$150 during the summer

Gas: \~$100 during winter

Water: \~$50

Internet: $35

\- Insulated attached 2 car garage

\- In-unit washer and dryer

\- Semi-finished basement

\- Within two miles of main highways

\- Quiet, family-friendly neighborhood with high school right across the street

\- He would have as much access to everything in the house as I would

Am I missing any info that would be useful?

There aren't a lot of single rooms for rent in my local area, but 2 bed and 3 bed houses for rent (according to craigslist) are going for at least $1000.

Based on this info, I don't really have a good enough idea on how much to charge him. I'm thinking $1000 with utilities included, but is that too much? I'm also trying to factor in things like taxes going up at some point, normal maintenance costs, for the aforementioned furnace to finally fail, and to have some money left over for a home improvement project or two every year.

From what I've read, I should get a lease agreement ready to go just in case things happen like damage to the house or he bails. Where would I find something like that? Is there a formal process to go through to make this landlord/tenant relationship official? Should I do a lease for a specific amount of time or just have him go month-to-month?

Long story short the bill came out to 48,000 and insurance only covered 310 dollars of it. I’ve spent countless hours on the phone trying to negotiate, but the most I can get is a 15% discount if I pay it in full. I ironically would’ve gotten 50% off if I didn’t have insurance.

Should I marry my fiancé before the end of the year?,"So we have been together for 5 years and have a wedding scheduled for March. Last March I started a job at a new company and hate it. I'm in the process of building my own business with the goal of leaving my current employment within the next year.

 So obviously there are tax benefits to getting married in 2021. I'm not too keen on the details here, however I'm also considering getting married ASAP so I can stop putting 10% of my income into 401k at a company I plan on leaving. One good thing about my employer is the 401k matching is insane (they put you 5% of your income into 401k for free, then match 75% of what you contribute up to 10% of your income.) Obviously if I plan on leaving I won't get fully vested which takes 5 years.

Starting your own gig and planning a wedding are two stressful/expensive events. I could use this 10% income towards these two ventures. Would love some feedback.",0,1637251083,169,906

Sanity check on rolling mega backdoor Roth IRA every time I get paid,My understanding is the major risk of the mega backdoor Roth IRA is having to pay pro rata tax on pretax and after tax contributions or rolling the pretax gains into an IRA and after-tax gains into a Roth IRA.

Carvana car sale offer - too good to be true?,"Hello all,

I have been considering getting an EV for some time now since my driving has been minimal (WFH so just to school and back, occasional outings, and errands) and I've been eyeing the Chevy Bolt since it seems to have the best range and features for the price. Now, I currently drive a 2019 Honda Civic EX-L with about 28K miles and in great condition, so I submitted it for sale to Carvana just to see what they would offer. 

I currently owe $13,082 on the loan and they came back with an offer of $27,093, which is slightly more than the full sticker price from the dealership when I got it. I think I financed about $22k after negotiations. Is there some catch I'm missing here, or would I be insane to pass this up? That's about $14k profit after taking care of the remainder of the loan, which I understand Carvana will handle since I've sold one car to them before. 

I could use that to essentially put half the value of a new car down and get some ultra low monthly payments on the Bolt, right? My current monthly is about $335 so I could really use the reduction.

My Boss said my PTO will not be paid out when I left to corporate - labor laws in my state say they must be paid out. Context inside,"Hi everyone,

Curious for advice in dealing with this situation. My boss is a nice person and helped promote me from our location to the corporate level, with a big salary bump of about double my salary. Btw, I was a full-time salaried employee. 

While I am eternally grateful, I could never use my PTO due to me not being able to go away for 2-3 days at a time since I was the only full time employee.

In my transition, I asked if my PTO would be paid out and he said no because they're a small business (he has the money to pay me though) and that is final.

I looked into labor laws in my state regarding PTO, they must be paid out unless stated in my contract PTO is not to be paid out.

Trading in Current Lease for New Lease,"I've been thinking about a possible scenario and it just seems too good to be true, so I wanted to post what I'm thinking and see if there's anything I'm not considering.

I currently lease a 2020 Honda Accord.  Buyout price is approximately $18,500 as of today.  I still have about a year and a half on the lease and residual value is around $14,000.

I've recently checked the value of the car on Carmax, Carvana, kbb.com, etc. and I'm pretty consistently being offered in the $28,000-$29,000 range for the car.  Obviously I know this may not hold true once someone sees the car, but let's assume I can get that for it.  It truly is in excellent condition and has less than 4,000 miles on it.

Is there any downside to trading this car in to another dealership?  I presume that if I could get a trade in value of $28,500, the dealership would pay off the buyout amount of $18,500, leaving roughly $10k.  Could I then use this $10k (minus any taxes, of course) to cover any potential down payment and pocket the rest?  I would either use what remained toward monthly payments, or perhaps pre-pay on the monthly payments to reduce the monthly amount.

I will almost definitely be leasing another vehicle after this, but who knows what the car market will be like in a year and a half, so I'm contemplating finding a good year end lease deal and snatching up another lease while I can get so much for my current lease.

These managers charge from 0.75% to 5% of capital per year and often have very large up front costs.

401K withdrawals from age 65 to 70 while still working to varying extents those years.,"My SO is a very healthy and extremely fit nurse (RN) who will turn 65 early next year.  Like many nurses she is somewhat burnt out from Covid related issues but is still extremely effective in her job and hopes to work more but not quite as much.

She has about $200 K in an 401K and $300 K in a 403B but not a lot of other savings.   She plans to cut down from working 36 hours per week full time to about 24 hours per week per diem (the per diem salary should be higher but won't include PTO and other benefits).  She also hopes to take substantial time off to travel at least one of the years before she reaches age 70.  At age 70 she probably reduces her time working as a nurse substantially (if not totally).

So far I've advised her to delay taking Social Security until age 70 to take advantage of the 8% increase in benefits each year delayed and avoid the earnings penalty before she reaches full retirement age in mid 2024.   I've also advised her to stop contributing to her 401K once she reaches 65 since she will be working only 67% of the hours she does currently and will need the money to make her nut.  Since she should be making a bit more per hour ""per diem"" and won't be paying into the 401K (this may not be allowed anyway working per diem) and her taxes will be more weighted toward the lower marginal rates her take home pay should be about 80% of her former pay.  At this point this is a ""back of the napkin"" calculation and could be off about 5% either way.

The problem is she will fall to approximately 20% short of her nut some of the next five years and a lot short of her nut any year she decides to take a lot of time off to travel or rest.  

Our questions are the following:

Can she take erratic yearly withdrawals from her 401K and/or 403B during the next five years (i.e., more in the year she travels and less in the years she works a bit less than now).  We realize once you reach age 70.5 you must take at least minimum withdrawals.  

Should she role over her 401K and 403B into an IRA?

Am I wrong about delaying collecting Social Security until age 70 (or at least age 67 when there is no earnings penalty).  She is in extremely good health.

Vanguard ROTH IRA question,"I have a Vanguard Roth IRA and need to take some money out of it. I've read from various sources that I am able to withdraw contributions without having to claim it as a taxable event, since it's not profits and it's already been taxed money. However, when I go to do the withdrawal I get the message regarding holding out X amount for taxes and that since I'm under 59 1/2 they have to report it and all that jazz. I guess the question is if it is reported, it's not a necessarily a taxable event since the money was mine after tax that I'm taking out and no profit was taken correct?

"Took a shot on a stock, lost 100% of its value.

Pay off Credit Cards or Pay off Student Loan,"Might be a scenario that I'm over thinking so I'm going to throw it out to the brilliant minds of strangers on the internet.

I have an offer from the company that owns my student loans (approx $135k) for a payoff amount of 5%. This would conclude all of my outstanding student loans. I believe the difference is treated as ""income,"" correct? There is interest on the loans but because of the age of the loans they are not doing anything aside from attempting to recoup something for them.

I also have the option to pay own credit cards totaling $10k - each would have a balance of $1k after I do it. I currently get charged about $150 a month interest, and pay down the new charges plus about $250 a month. At that rate it will take me a couple of years to clear the CC.

Choosing either option results in a reduction of my current savings to $2k, $1k in checking. I make $45k a year. My credit score is ""good"" in the low 700s. I would like to begin the process of building a house on land my family owns and believe that Option A might be best for that, but I'm thinking that the stronger ""penalties"" right now seem to be allowing my CC balance to grow with the higher monthly interest.

Which of the two options is best for me to clear up? Thank you for your judgement and advice.",0,1637244835,242,1284

Questions on timing  


* I can only cash the bond out after one year. Is this Correct?

Question on 401k vs IUL,"Hello r/personalfinance,

Right now the firm I work has a limited 401k plan offering, and the fees varry so I am looking to maximize my growth. Any input on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. The money going into an IUL or 401k will NOT be touched unless there is extreme DIRE need. Please see this post for the 401k options. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/qshfrs/how\_should\_i\_choose\_to\_allocate\_401k\_withholdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/qshfrs/how_should_i_choose_to_allocate_401k_withholdings/)

&amp;#x200B;

The plan:

max out 401k in 2022 at 20,500 or to invest that much yearly in some form.

&amp;#x200B;

Details that matter for this purpose:

Jan 2022 my salary will be somewhere between 100-110k

firm offers 3% match at 100%, then another 2% match at 50%. So at a minimum i will be doing 5% contribution to a 401k.

I live in NY so high taxes. 

tax bracket for the IRS will be somewhere between 22-24% on a lot of our income. When i did a rough tax plan our effective tax rate will be around 17-19% yearly.  

I will be married in 2022 so our combined income will be around 180-200kish 

No dependents currently but plan is to have 2-3 kids.

I only have life insurance through my job. 

My only debt right now is 140-150kish student loans, and 180k mortgage. I don't have a desire to pay the student loans early as I can get a better ROI by investing the spare cash. 

After all bills monthly are paid and I max out the 401k. I will have spare cash of around $100. 

I am not including my partners money on this as she might max out as well or help pay for a house. Currently she is saving almost everything to help with a down payment.",0,1637244035,276,1722

Used car advice,"Hello,

I am looking at trading my current 2014 vehicle plus cash for a used 2014 Honda Odyssey.  The dealer is offering between $11,000(Canada) for my current vehicle plus a difference of $9,800 (can probably get this down another thousand) including tax and certification.  Current vehicle is paid for and I'd be paying the difference outright. I have no idea what pre-shortage prices looked like, but I assume the offer for my current vehicle is a good one. 

Though my family and I are looking for the convenience and practically of a van I don't know if my thought process here makes sense.  My current vehicle has 131,000 KM and the new one has 133,000 KM, does it make sense to move from one high mileage vehicle to another at this cost?  The vehicle is clean with no body rust and barely any chassis rust, good service records and no accidents, but who knows what problems it could start to have at that mileage, conversely, who knows what problems my current vehicle could start having.  I am hoping that because it's a Honda it will last at least another 5 years.

Alternatively, I could look for something newer with less mileage and pay a greater difference either through a dealer loan or lower interest LOC, but my wife and I weren't looking to break the bank here and the thought of taking on car payments bothers me.

Appreciate any advice.

Thanks.",0,1637243425,242,1365
Near retirement and need advice,"Long story short, I recently divorced and was left high and dry. I have $80,000 in savings and make $85,000 a year as a 60 year old. I need to purchase a home and will use my savings for the down payment.

Hey PF,
So the gym I've been a member of has closed up shop. I had been a member for quite a few years and my account had been on autopay. After the gym permanently closed, I started receiving emails about a past due balance. 
 The first was received Oct 21:

""Your membership has been cancelled at [GYM]. 

We were not able to resolve issues with the landlord. 

IMPORTANT:  You will receive a prorated refund for your time. If you don't get it within 15 days just email us back.  
Ex: if your due date was the 30th of the month and you had access for 25 days you would get 5 days of refund. 

VERY VERY IMPORTANT:  ANY PAST DUES ARE STILL OWED.   ANY BANK DISPUTES OR CHARGEBACKS ARE SENT DIRECTLY TO 3RD PARTY COLLECTIONS.  IF YOU DISPUTE ANY PAST PAYMENTS IT WILL BE SENT DIRECTLY TO A CREDITOR.""

Lifetime ISA and buying INTO a property (UK),"Hi!

I currently own a 1 bedroom flat by myself where my girlfriend lives with me.  
My girlfriend has a lifetime ISA and at the end of the 2021 tax year would've saved \~£20,000  


The rise of house prices in my area, combined with savings I've been putting away means that we will be looking to move next year into a property around the £500,000 region.  


Unfortunately, this exceeds the £450,000 limit for the lifetime ISA and would mean paying a 25% penalty on her savings.  


We're looking to see if we can ""get around"" this buy getting her to buy **into** my current property - using the entire of her £20,000 L-ISA savings and therefore not paying any penalties.

What to do with 15k pension cash balance payout when new my job will put my income over the limit for IRA and Roth IRA?,"Good morning!

Back door Roth questions,"Hey all,

I would like to learn more about a back door Roth and put some money in one myself, but I have a few questions first. So from the get go, it seems basic enough.

2) is that tax still worth having a Roth IRA?

Can’t make up my mind if i should live with my friends in the town I like or alone and at a lower rent but 20min away,"Disclaimer: if I make grammar errors please bear with me, English is not my main language 
Okay, so the title pretty much explains it, right now I live with 3 roommates, one of which is good friend of mine, and we usually hang out or watch movies and stuff together everyday and it’s pretty cool since I haven’t always had a lot of friends, plus I really like this town where this house is located, I’m a the point where if i go out, I immediately know where I have to go to do whatever it is that I need to do, I have all my friends and connections here. But, the landlord recently has increased the rent a bit, it’s still in line with the other rooms for rent in this town, but I’m not exactly a high earner so having to pay less would mean that I could invest in something else, and so, my father has asked me if I would like to live in one apartment that he owns, and I would just have to pay for taxes and bills, which would be at least half what I pay for the rent of this room, if not lower, but said apartment is located at a 20 minutes or so drive from this town and I would be living alone, which is not bad but also, like I said I really like how I have adjusted here, and I’m not really good at making friends since I’m a bit socially awkward, but the money saved from the rent would become really handy at this moment since I’m making some investments and having to pay this rent is holding me back a little bit.

Ethics of paying 7% of income on rent?,"I moved in with my partner and we both have very good jobs; together, we make a little over 9000€ a month (pre tax). The apartment isn't subsidized and there are no rules on who is and isn't allowed to live there however it is owned by the state for the explicit purpose of providing affordable housing. For this reason, our rent is highly controlled and only 600€ (this is extraordinarily low in our city but the area is... not great). The apartment itself is nice enough but it's starting to feel kind of icky. Basically all of our neighbors are either elderly, families with 8 kids and one income, or groups of students. If we were to move out, a comparable apartment in a much nicer area would cost around 2000€. We could easily afford this but my partner wants to stay here so we can continue to save buckets of money.

Should I feel slimy about living here? Like the rest of the world, our city is having a huge problem with affordable housing but it wouldn't be too terribly difficult for us to move because our income is so high.",0,1637231519,192,1037

World gym charging me for another year contract,"So I’ve signed up with this gym back in feb last year for a 1 year membership. Turns out I’ve still been paying for it 9 months over the 1 year contract. I couldn’t find my contract on my email but because it was never sent to me. I can see all the times they tried to take the money out via emails and when I first signed up with them but no contract. 

Anyways I phoned them up and asked to cancel the membership as well as asking for a copy of my contract which she’ll send tomorrow as she was just knocking off. She states in the contract that I’ve signed up for a two year contract because I had ticked the reoccurring plan which means I practically pay for another year after the first year is finished. Weird thing is I don’t remember ticking any box let alone want to sign up for another yearly membership, and wouldn’t they have to write another contract out for me for another year or is this just one of their loopholes to get around charging you for another year if you’re not switched onto cancelling the plan?

Would really like some help/advice because to be honest I’d really like to get my money back as initially signed up for a 1 year contract. TIA",0,1637228068,223,1167
Advice on how to get to FIRE with COVID portfolio winnings?,"For reference I have been investing for years without much real success until the COVID crash came along.

House Poor? Am I crazy?,"Hey y'all I'm thinking of buying a 1BR condo (SF) and on one hand, I think I'm crazy, but on the other hand, think it's doable and I'm excited about it

I'm making 150K currently and going to put up 10% on a 760K condo.  After the down payment, I'll still have non-retirement investments and a rainy day fund of around 75K.

Credit card AND refi?,"Hi all,

I've read the boards rules and looked at the Wiki. Wonderful information there. Thank you!

I was sick for five years and I'm just now getting back to good credit. My history is this: I went from 800s before illness to high 600s afterward. I'm now back up to 791, 722 &amp; 722. I have only one open account - a student loan. No lates on the account now. But, during the start of my illness, when I was in the hospital for months, my student loan payments were late over three months. Since then, I've always paid on time. Since I have no credit card I was thinking of getting one to help build my score back to the 800s. However, my loan servicer also told me I'd be wise to refinance my house. So, I'm seeking advice:

Should I go for the CC and raise my score first BEFORE refinancing? Or should I go for refi first? I don't know that refinancing will necessarily raise my score. In fact, it sounds like the hard inquiry will drop it some - even if I'm approved. Is that right? I assume based on this that I found in the WIKI that I shouldn't do both too close together:

***"" If you are looking to take out a large loan such as a mortgage or auto  loan in the near term, you should avoid opening new lines of credit.  Your score will not have time to recover from the effect of the hard  inquiries.""***

I would greatly appreciate any advice you might offer. TIA!",0,1637220225,263,1376
Savings/invest vs buying a home now,"This post is going to combine many financial categories: retirement, savings, investing, home ownership...

Fiancee and I live in Orange County and have middle class incomes, about 250k total. We are about 30 y/o and own a townhome but we are in need of a new living situation for personal, but very important reasons, that includes safety/peace of mind. A few figures:

270k in current home equity, home value about 600k est.
~3700 monthly expenses (mortgage/how/insurance/utilities/car payments, aka all fixed expenses)
150k saved
I max out my 401k and this is non negotiable
Fiancee has no retirement except the 6k I put into her Roth IRA
Our monthly take home pay is about 10k but varies heavily due to one of us having a commission based job.

Home prices are insane and we are looking at ones in the 850k to 900k range max. This would really bump up our monthly expenses by another 1700 to 2000 I believe. 

The argument/discussion we are having is that I want to keep 50k in the bank and add everything else to our investment account (stocks/mutual funds). Everything that we have one 50k after paying for ALL monthly expenses goes to investments.  My Fiancee wants to keep the majority in cash due to the uncertainty of the markets. Not uncertainty right now , but just the overall idea that markets have uncertainty and you don't know if your investments will be worth more or less tomorrow. Fiancee wants to buy a new home urgently (within a year and a half). What others factors do we need to consider to help us decide on what to do. My thoughts are that our cash is just losing buying power by sitting in our bank accounts. She likes seeing that the savings account has money slowly being added to it after each paycheck and likes the security of it. A huge factor that plays into me wanting to invest is that her retirement is ONLY her IRA right now and she's not prioritizing retirement savings at all. She's thinking, what's the point of saving all the money right now for retirement if you're wasting your time now not living the life you want. 

Something that always resonated with me was my dad telling me that the first two things you do with your paycheck is pay taxes, then pay your retirement account... Then you can do what you want with the rest.  Another thing he has said (and something he has said in front of my fiancee) is to buy as much home as you can now, because money will come later with raises and whatnot and your mortgage will get easier to pay with time. Both great pieces of advice, but I think the order that I've mentioned those two statements reflects the importance of each.

If we plan on buying a new home within the next two years, should we be investing what we have? 

Sorry if there was a lot of rambling in here, but I'm trying to convey both of our perspectives.",0,1637218113,503,2816

Situation:

Just started my first “good paying” job since finishing University a few months ago. Majority of my credit card debt is from the last year. Combination of me starting the year with a bad case of covid/pneumonia (couldn’t work for 3 months and $6000 hospital bill) while using credit cards to stay afloat while finishing said degree. After moving back with parents and not making money for a while I now have a job making about $2500/month after taxes and such. A real worry I have is about my vehicle. It is having issues and my mechanic straight up said it is drivable but to trade it in ASAP.  

I have been reading post on here about consolidating debts to get everything in one place and myself back on track. My local credit union and my bank, WF, won’t offer me any help in that regard which I get. I did receive a loan offer from Upstart through the mail. The personal loan offer I received is for $13000 at 21.81% APR with $330/month payment for 5yr.

I have been pre-qualified through Capital One for an Auto Loan with a rate below 10%.

At the same time lower my utilization on these credit cards by paying as much as I can off via the personal loan. I can not tell if this plan makes sense or if my brain is in a fog trying to figure this out by myself. 

As far as my personal spending. Besides everything you see here I have hospital bills from this year, health/car insurance, prescriptions I must pay for, and groccereis. No rent. Random exspenses may come up due to family stuff but thats it.

Refinance mortgage every 6 months w/ big lender credit,"I'm currently refinancing my house - we just bought the house 8 months ago, and rates are slightly better than when we bought, but not good enough for me to do a refinance staying at the 30-year term (we couldn't reduce our monthly payment by &gt;5%), so I decided to switch to a 20-year term. 

For the 20-year refinance, I decided to go with a big lender credit (sacrificing rate by about 0.25%-0.375% above par, but still 0.25% lower than my existing 30-year mortgage) option to fully cover origination fees, title costs, prepaid interest, and escrow. To throw some rough numbers out:

|Origination fees|$1.2k|
|:-|:-|
|Title costs|$1.9k|
|Prepaid interest|$0.4k|
|Escrows|$4.3k|
|Lender credit|$(7.8)k|

I know the first three items are additional expenses I am incurring because of the refinance (and are being offset by the credit), but the escrow amount is basically getting refunded to me when I close my old loan, so I view that amount as a ""gain"".

This had me thinking - **is it really possible to just refinance again every 6 months to take advantage of the lender credits (resulting in the old lender refunding my old escrow and new bank paying for the new escrow via lender credit)?** Even if you don't fall under the ""benefit"" of reducing your payment by 5%, you could switch between 15/20/30 year terms.

In my specific scenario, assuming rates stay pretty flat, I would be able to get a 30-year loan at 3.25% or 3.375% with a significant lender credit to cover all (or nearly all) my costs. So basically get back to my first loan's rate, but get two escrow checks (\~$8k-$9k) in the process.

I fully understand the risk of rates rising - which of course could stop the plan to refinance as one wouldn't want to refinance at a significantly higher interest rate than they currently have - but in a theoretical case where rates are relatively flat, this seems like a way to bring in cash flow while keeping one's principal balance relatively the same (increases in the principal would occur during the months in which payments are skipped, but those obviously would be offset by the fact that you're not making those monthly payments - effectively getting a small cash-out loan).

I also believe this is a zero-sum type of activity, and the mortgage banker will get a solid commission each time I refinance, so he/she would clearly be a winner in all of this as well. **But who effectively loses in this process of transactions? Is it the lender that underwrites the loan? If they are a wholesale broker and sell the loan right away, is it the acquiring investors that lose when I subsequently refinance?**

Open to other risks or thoughts I may be missing in this example. Thanks in advance!",0,1637210659,456,2708

I made a choice to pursue a master's degree in urban planning in my 30's which I was hoping would be a greater return on investment than it turned out to be. I'm now $54k USD in debt with no retirement savings, no home (I'm renting).. and $27k CAD in savings. 

I'm really panicked by how much I owe... it wasn't my intention to take out so many loans when I went to school. I ended up ditching the career I was hoping to pursue and learned how to code with the primary reason of being able to pay this off, support myself and work remotely. I now make $95k CAD ($75k USD). I still feel pretty underpaid though to be honest and the job/people I work with make me absolutely miserable. 

I suppose I'm looking for advice for what to do in terms of balancing paying off debt/investing in retirement while I also balancing wanting to quit your job..",0,1637210060,181,961

Buying a car: Better to buy new or used?,"Bear with me please, this will be a long post.

In my early 20s, looking to purchase my first car. Have about 10k to put as down payment. Initially was planning to buy used but now I'm considering buying new for a few reasons:

1.) I'm skeptical of private sales due to the increased likelihood of a bad buy, scams, unseen/costly issues appearing in the future, as opposed to buying pre-owned certified from a dealer. I assume certain measures could probably be taken to avoid such issues, but I am not knowledgeable enough with cars to know what to look for.

2.) As mentioned above, I might consider buying pre-owned certified from a dealer. But with COVID-19 and it's supply chain issues, it seems all car prices have been significantly inflated/marked up, but even more so for used cars. This is evident just by the crazy prices Carmax and Carvana are willing to offer to buy people's used cars lately. I also believe the high used car prices are partially because new cars can only be marked up so much from the given MSRP, whereas used cars prices have a little more pricing flexibility.

My father thinks I should buy a new car versus a used car, mainly for the above reasons. He argues that because used car prices are so artificially high, it is not much better/cheaper of an investment like it once had been over buying new. He also adds that I won't have to worry about any underlying issues, because even if I did run into issues, it would likely be covered under the manufacturer's warranty.

Advice like this is putting me on the fence between used and new. Could buying used really not have much of a financial advantage at the currently inflated prices? While I understand that such comparisons/advice will vary depending on what make, model, and year of cars I am looking at, but I would appreciate any financially sound advice I can use as a general rule of thumb.",0,1637208248,331,1882

Sudden Income Increases and Life Planning - IRA &amp; 401k Questions,"TLDR: My wife and I grew up poor and have slowly worked our way up to relatively high incomes to the point that we are unsure how to handle it. I think we might be HENRYs


**More Background**

I've (33) recently undergone a significant career change that has led my income to double to around $116k and my wife (31) recently received a raise to around $98k. For perspective, our combined income last year was around $130k and we expect to make around $230k in 2022. This is all good news, and we are truly grateful, but we both out earn everyone in our families by a big margin and we don't really know what to do with it. I tend to handle the budget, and I thought our income would grow a little slower and thus I would have more time to learn these things. My plan was to follow the PF flowchart, but I think I've outgrown certain aspects of that chart, or at least have a few more specific questions.

I've tried to be detailed here to give more context, but please let me know if any further information would help. Questions are at the end of the post.


**Expenses and Debt:**

* Our total monthly expenses: $8k /month. We are in an area with relatively high cost of living and a few of our big line items are daycare ($3k/mo), mortgage ($1,800 mortgage), commuting ($500/mo), and the rest is fairly modest living expenses for a family of 4. We've done a lot to reduce this over the past few years and I'm not sure how much we can reasonably do here. 
* Mortgage ~$280k, we locked in at 2.7% over 28 more years, I'm not too interested in rushing to pay it off.
* Around $2500 in student loans and another 
* $2000 in bills that are on a no interest payment plan. 
* No leases or auto loans
* We each have private life insurance ($1.5M USD ea) and long-term disability plans. These are costing us around $300 /mo. and given our lack of help from family, we are committed to this. If something happens to either me or the wife, then the house is paid for and there is a lump sum to help the surviving parent not stress, pay off the house ($280k left), kids with counseling, college, etc.

**Income &amp; Assets**

* Combined gross salaries are around $214k ($116k + $98k) before bonuses, which we can both get though I am ineligible until 2023. We expect her to get a bonus of around $15k in the summer of 2022. 
* $22k in cash, which is around 6 months if we both lost our jobs and cut expenses accordingly. We can technically break even on 1 income.
* Together we have about $92k in our 401k accounts from previous jobs/employers. It is all consolidated with fidelity and 100% into index funds
* Her current 401k: traditional, employer match of 3% for her 6%
* My 401k: 7% employer contribution with no required match (vested at 20% per year for 5 years). It has a roth option into which I am currently contributing 10% of my income.
* Starting in January, will have HSA maxed out
* We each have roth IRAs that we will max out for the first time this year. This was actually our big financial goal before our job changes.

**Goals**

* Purchase a vehicle $10-12k in the next 1-2 years
* A few life expenses: vasectomy, lasik, some house work, etc. (say $12k total in the next 2 years)
* Move (based on school districts) in around 10 years
* Help kids with college (ages 2 &amp; 4) if they choose to go
* Have the ability to throttle back our work load in our 50's, so invest heavy now

**Questions**

* Primary question: After taxes, expenses, etc., we have decided to aim to set aside $55k for retirement in 2022. How best to invest it?
* Our income for 2022 seems like it might be around $20k over the roth limit. 
   * Do I adjust my 401k to traditional so that we can lower our AGI and maintain the roth IRAs?
   * ...or go full into the roth 401k and switch to traditional IRAs?
* Are 529 plans for kids colleges worth it? especially if they do not go to an eligible school (some are state specific, for example)
   * I've also read its better to take care of ourselves first, and put us in a position to help with the kids at that time with cash or shorter-term savings. Advice or insight appreciated.
* Are there any other longer-term strategies or best practices to consider should our income increase further? I'm just trying to build a solid foundation so any advice is appreciated.

Finally, this subreddit has been an invaluable resource for me over the years. So thanks to this community and I look forward to any insight or advice you might have to share regarding my situation.",0,1637207685,822,4499

Drowning in credit card debt,"Hey guys, I just wanted some input from you guys before I did anything. Last year I sadly got into some money spending habits that weren't really ideal and now I have a bunch of credit card debt, about $16,000 to be exact. This is divided between 3 credit cards and I started making payments but I've been considering applying from a loan from my bank in order to consolidate the debt so I can spend less time paying it off and also not stress out about making payments for each one every paycheck. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make $350 every week and usually I spend 100 or 200 on paying off the CC and keep the 100 for groceries or buying food and the 50 is for gas. I know it's not ideal living like this from paycheck to paycheck which is why I'm wondering if there was a better way to go about this. I also have some privatized student loans I have to make payments for every 3 months, and the government student loan payments will start again in January so I'm a bit worried.

Figuring out how to build credit and buy a car,"So recently I got married - on the honeymoon my car broke down and it's scrapped. I'm looking for a reliable car that will last the long haul. My FICO is 790, I have two credit cards that I pay off on time, every time, and I have no student loans or other debts. I pay rent, and have had a full-time job since graduating a year and a half ago. I have enough cash to make a substantial downpayment, as well as investment accounts that I regularly fund. I'd like to buy a house within a year or two. My wife has less assets and about 30K in student loans, but a 780 FICO.

&amp;#x200B;

When I applied for a loan I was offered a 18.4K 60 month term, 9.7% APR, no prepayment penalties (1.5K down). It's a used car, so I expected the interest rate to be higher, but not that high. I was told the rate was high and other lenders even denied me, because I lack recent installment loans.

I have a few options in my eyes, but please, let me know your thoughts:

1. I can make a down payment of something like 6-8K - this will not deplete my emergency funds. Then, I make regular payments for the length of the loan.
2. I can buy the car in cash, and my parents will give me a loan for the rest, offering a 30 month term, 2.5% APR, no prepayment penalties.
3. I can finance the car, make a down payment between 6-8K, and then have my parents lend me the rest of the money, with the terms outlined in 2. I will then make monthly payments on that loan for 1-2 years until it's closed.
4. I can finance the car, make a down payment between 6-8K, then make monthly payments for the life of the loan (60 months)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking 3 might be a better option for me, with or without a loan from my parents, but I'm unsure. On one hand, I'd like to have at least some history of installment loan payments, so that when I apply for home mortgages I don't get screwed on interest rates. I've seen a lot of conflicting views on paying off car loans early. It seems like if I pay it off early, that will lower my average account age and may not serve to provide much history of installment loan payments. If I make a very large first payment, but then monthly payments for the life of the loan, I can still show a history of installment loan payments and avoid paying as much interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other options could be having my Dad cosign, and potentially getting a lower interest rate, or just shopping around more with different lenders and look for a different car.",0,1637207086,463,2465
Cash Back Question,"Short and sweet question but may be opinionated.

I have a 401(k) through my employer that is being contributed with enough to fulfill their match. 

I also have a Roth IRA that i recently started funding, but will be a far cry from maxing yearly. 

I also have an interest in cryptocurrency, but not in the “let’s go to the meme casino” mentality. More buy known projects and hold. Keeps tax implications low as well. 

But my interest in crypto led me to get a debit card through coinbase that acts as a prepaid debit card. You load USD fiat and exchange 1:1 for USDC (or use whatever other cryptocurrency with conversion fees etc). No capital gain/loss triggered since its 1:1 with no fees as long as it’s USD or USDC. Every purchase rewards 4% cash back which equates to roughly 100-150 / month for me.

These cash back rewards are mostly instantly credited and can be liquidated for fiat instantly for a small fee or over 2-3 days for no fee. 

So for the question.

"Chase Bank $10,000 Fraud Transaction. Seeking advice.","I was checking my email today when I noticed an email sent to me as a reply from an email I had apparently sent to them. I checked my sent folder to find an email stating that ""the money was not deposited to my account, and I cannot log into the account,"" which was sent to a company? called Douugh. Now the strange thing is that the email I supposedly sent is basically calling out this company as a scam.

After seeing that email I got nervous since it was obvious I did not send it, so I checked my bank account to find that $10,000 were sent somewhere, I say somewhere because all the statement says is that it was sent to: Douugh P2P ""my name""  webid:\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Right after this I called Chase to see what steps I could take to report this, they stated that this transaction was made directly from my account, not from my debit/credit card, and that they were going to send a some papers through mail to start the claim. 

To further give information, I checked my Chase account to see if there was any suspicious emails/phone numbers added, only to find that there was a phone added which I did not recognize and that my account was sharing data with this company called Douugh USA LLC, similarly to how data is shared with Robinhood when your account is connected. It is safe to say that I never authorized this, I have never even heard of this company, yet I had emails from them as if I signed up for their service.

"Refinancing my house and had a few options for my future, but I'm not sure which one is correct.","Good evening, 

I'm currently refinancing my house to buy back a few years of teaching so I can retire early. However, after doing the math I'm not sure if it is worth it. I can retire at the end of 2025 with about 2800 per month or buy back these two years and end with 3200 per month. Also, in case of retiring early I would be more secure. Teaching is getting harder and I don't know if I can even make it 3 more years.

I will be getting $50,000 from the refinancing and to buy back my years of teaching it will cost $36,000. I will be left with only $14,000. 

My question is, is it even worth buying back those years or should I put the whole $50,000 into stocks and bonds to help for when I retire. I'm currently 56 and I don't know if this is the safest path, or if the safest is to just buy back the past 2 years. Any advice is welcome.

Considering putting house on marker after 2yrs with home- swap program,"I was a first time home buyer in 2019, I was full of dreams for the house I currently occupy. I am 28, have no inherited wealth, used a loan from my retirement fund for down-payment on FHA loan (paid back in &lt;1yr). Fully employed thankfully.

At present day. I've had 1 tenant that left in October (she was finished renovating her house), and a prospective second. The basement unit is only 500sq ft so I'm not able to charge much (300$ was negotiated, thats half my monthly mortgage payment with insurance). I just don't have the energy anymore to conduct these renovations I was dreaming of. To build out the attic to be livable, I would need 3x the amount of equity I've been quoted by bank. The house is fully functional and move in ready - but all the modifications I wish to make include moving water lines, poking out new windows, tearing up and replacing floor and bathroom tiling.  The house is a 1912 old steel mill worker property in Chicago south side - 3 floor a-frame sitting on .25 acres.  My neighborhood is unfortunately undergoing gentrification pretty rapidly, and a bunch of families are cashing in on this and the sellers market. Two houses on my block have been sold to investors and were in market only for 2mo or less. They were gut rehabs though.

Since I closed on this house my income has doubled. But without having a robust savings to lean into, the renovations to making this my dream home aren't making any progress. My bank quotes the equity they can loan me at 12k, but when I talk to sellers agents they're showing market value of my property increased by 1/3 my closing price.  Granted, I know if I sell, I likely won't get full equity. 

I'm happy to provide specifics on income and housing estimates. But I found a credible home swap program (Knock) where they'll loan you 60-80% of your estimated equity upfront to close on a non-contingent propety. You dictate the final loan amount, so I could request 30% equity loan, assuming I may have trouble selling. You have 6months to use remaining equity or other funds to spruce up your old house and sell. Any profit, you pocket. Any equity loss is added to your mortgage payments to them. After 6mo if property doesn't sell, they purchase for previously agreed on amount - typically 80% market value. 

In Chicago there are newly renovated homes &gt;300k at 2x my square footage that have the floor plan I'm trying to make at current property. At the end of the day, I might be spending as much on a higher mortgage as I am currently spending at home depot and with unreliable contractors presently. The peace of having the ideal floor plan and recently renovated spaces alone would be worth the increased mortgage. The stress of trying to complete these projects mostly alone eats up a lot of time, and despite offers of help from friends - none of them know how to lay drywall or move water pipes. I'm nervous of my house selling for significantly lower than market estimates and then having higher new mortgage, high loan to Knock from not hitting good equity, and my student loans are kicking in as well. 

Regardless of staying or going , I think I'm in an okay position. My property value will continue to go up due to 3 different investment plans for the south side. If I go with a larger, newly finished property, it will also likely still gain value as everyone is expecting the new Obama library to spike prices. I guess it's just getting to me mentally that I can't feel nested in my current property for a few more years. I want to inhabit the attic and build out a beautiful open floor plan space. But until then, half my belongings are still in boxes and I don't have time to engage in the at-home activities that bring me peace. 

TLDR ;; naive first time home buyer gets in over their head with renovations on old (but technically liveable) property. Considering home swap program for newly renovated, but nervous at ability to sell current home.

I’m not sure how to allocate my money and I could really use some help,"I currently make about $2300 bi weekly and I can comfortably pay all my bills and everything with about $1500/check. This leaves me $800 extra per pay check but I am not sure how to allocate it due to some situations in my life:
-My dad has stage 4 lung cancer and I don’t know how long I have left with him. He lives about 600 miles away so my plan is to road trip and see him every month if I can.
-My car has 188,000 miles on it, it needs to be replaced because it has some damages where the lights don’t fully work and the headlights aren’t aimed correctly due to some of the damages. I’ve spent over $2000 to keep it running but it’s likely at the end of its life.
-I badly need dental work as well, which is roughly around $2000 at a minimum.
-My credit card utilization is almost maxed and my credit score is about 580

My thinking is to split my extra funding 4 ways between debt, dentist, car, and visiting my dad. I want to lower my credit card utilization to get a better APR on a car purchase, but also have a decent amount down. The car market sucks right now so I’m trying to save extra for a down payment due to my poor credit score.

I can’t ignore the dentist and paying down credit cards will improve my score.

Any advice?",0,1637201655,237,1241
Over contribute my 401k to get max employer contributions at new company,"Started a new company in August and I was on track to max my 401k at my old company. I had about 16k total in my 401k for the 2021 calendar year. New company makes you wait 90 days before they let you access retirement benefits (annoying but not that big of a deal). As far as I can tell there is only a limit of being below 90% of total income. I will have two total pay periods and roughly 3500 left to go to max out my 401k for 2021. My new company offers a 4% match which would be greater than 3500 and thus be over the IRS maximum. My question is, would it make sense to contribute 4% of my total salary (not paycheck) the last two pay periods to get the full employee match benefit? This of course would put me over the IRS maximum for 401k limit. If I did this, what would I have to do to make the IRS happy. Could I just move some of my rollover 401k from my old company and pay taxes on that? I am assuming any taxes or penalties I would have to pay would be less than the amount my employer matches. Not sure if anyone has dealt with this and could assist me on how to avoid paying the least taxes/penalties.",0,1637201504,227,1118
Need advice on my options for switching to real estate career,"Need advice on my options

I’m 24, male, currently employed full time at 52k salary. 

I want to switch to real estate and have just completed the pre licensing course. 

I have two options: 

There is a job with an ibuyer company that lists the average income for first year employees and the average income for the third year employees. 

My currently salary at my job is $52,000. 

First year average pay at the above mentioned company is $54,000. 

Third year average pay is $124,000. 

Benefits:

Mileage 

License dues

Association fees

MLS fees

“Choose from various full-family medical, dental, and vision plans, with minimal out-of-pocket expenses.” (I’m not sure what expenses they mean. Co-pay?)





The other option is to continue my current job and try to start my real estate career as a sales associate at a traditional broker part time, at first. This is doable, I hear, but difficult, and I am really disliking my current job of 6.5 years so that’s why I’m in a hurry to quit. 

My plan for the next couple years would be to eventually become a sales associate at a traditional brokerage, where I would be independent, but I’d have to wait to build a nestegg before I can quit my job. Since I have a mortgage and am single, building a nestegg would take quite a while, and as you probably know, you can’t just quit your job and become a realtor with no guarantee of income any time soon.

Do you think it’d be better to stay at my current job and try part time at a traditional brokerage until I can quit my current job? I’m pretty unhappy at my current job or I’d stay until I can build a nestegg with real estate. 

There are mixed opinions about how long it takes to make money at a traditional brokerage. Of course, it depends on how hard and persistent you are too.

My online retail accounts are being taken down left and right and I don't know what to do,"This is a situation in progress so I'm going to try to keep it simple to understand.

It all started with PayPal about a month ago. My sister wanted some diy jewelry from Etsy and I thought why not I'll just pay with PayPal I've done this a million times before. Cut away to a day or two and I receive an email that my account was permanently suspended for being in violation of PayPal terms of service.

I tried calling them and explained the situation and they asked me about the purchase on Etsy. I tried explaining that it was simply jewelry and accessories you can get anywhere and they simply said they already shut down my account and all I can do at this point is wait and see if anything happens (nothing did). I can only assume they thought the seller was selling counterfeit goods or running some overseas illegal operation. 

Next it was my Venmo. I got an email claiming I was in violation of the terms and service, the same thing that happened with PayPal. It hasn't been used in months since the only time I can recall using it is when I went out to eat with friends and we split the bill. I called and they said I would have to send in a picture of my ID to verify it was but the whole thing seemed fishy and I just figured I can live without a venmo account.

The most urgent of these however was my Google Play account. I recently bought a $50 gift card to pay off my subscriptions to apps like Discord and HBO Max and such due to no longer having a PayPal account. I had 10 dollars in the card left so I decided to buy an in game purchase for 20 and pay the difference with my debit.

 The purchase went through my cut to a few minutes later and it charged my card the full amount and more, totally 30 dollars for something that should have been 20. I can only assume my gift card was fraudulent and they decided to play it safe and delete my entire account.

Obviously without a Google Play account I can no longer make in game purchases, buy new apps, rent movies, renew app subscriptions so this is my breaking point to where I finally decide to do something before another one of my accounts gets taken done.

 I have accounts such as Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo, Steam where I have cumulatively spent upwards of thousands of dollars over several years. I've made an appointment with my local bank tomorrow and get a new debit card and hopefully this solves all my issues.",0,1637199293,449,2395

Should a subcontractor be paid before setting aside money for tax purposes?,"I live in the UK, and I’m a freelance web developer, working with a startup as their only front-end developer.

However when they’ve paid me the last two months (haven’t been working with them long), they’ve told me that they deduct 19% from what they earn, and set it aside to make sure they can pay their taxes, and they then give me 60% of the remainder.

I’ve done some basic research, and maybe I’m wrong here (I both expect and welcome you to tell me if I am), but is this 19% tax they speak of corporation tax? They are a limited company.

Losing home coverage. Not sure how to proceed afterwards,"Tldr: Home insurance found out my mom doesn't live at the property and will be canceling coverage in 30 days (covering current situation). Not sure if I'm supposed to get homeowners or renters to cover until since house isn't in my name (and there is no rent agreement/contract).

So the house is under a mortgage under my mom's name and so was the home owners insurance. She remarried and moved in with her new husband, leaving the house to me to pay off. Because there was less than 10 years at the time the bank said refinancing would be moot and not worth the effort to do. Told the insurance rep ages ago what we were planning and he said it would have to stay under her name since the mortgage was.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, some siding damage has shown on the house; assumption that it was weather damage. Contact insurance they send an adjuster to inspect the damage. I ask if it will be fine for me to be the contact and handle things since my mom lives elsewhere. There I am told the she can't have insurance for a place she doesn't live at and they will have to tell the insurance. 

And today the insurance called and told my mom that they will cover this case but in 30 days coverage will be gone. Which leave me uncertain of what to do.

Father needs to rebuild credit,"Hello! So, my father (60yo) has been using a prepaid card for his expenses for maybe the past seven years, he does not have any credit cards or checking accounts because he has believed for the longest that he owes student loans. 

His experience with BofA (checking) led to him closing all of his accounts and sticking with prepaid cards. What happened was, he got his paycheck from his job and all of it was taken out of his checking due to student loans, which is what BofA told him. (this was years ago)

Since then, he’s been rolling with the prepaid route. Just today, I talked to him and asked him what his credit score was and he said he didn’t know. So, I downloaded CK and Experian for him to get a better picture of it.

So, the score needs work (519-530 across the three bureaus) but the fascinating thing I seen was that his credit file looks like a brand new one. He has 0 credit history, 0 payment history, 0 inquires, but he has 4 derogatory marks and 4 collections from four hospitals (it looks like) that he recognizes as hospital bills he didn’t pay. The total balance owed on his credit file is $1,623 from these collections. 

His eyes lit up when he seen this because he was under the impression that he owed a lot more. Also, his student loans balance is showing $0 as his accounts were closed. Same with auto loans.

He is more than happy to pay for it, but not in one shot. He would like to negotiate a way he can pay it off monthly.

My question here today is, what advice would you give him to go on about this? How can he pay it? Or, is there a different route he should take? Also, on his credit file it says he has 5 open accounts but these accounts seem to be linked to his collections. Is this correct?

I also tried to open a checking account for him with Chase but he was denied. I’m also planning to tell him to get into a secured card with Discover so he can rebuild his credit.

His goal is to get himself an apartment. (He lives with a roommate atm)

Everyone has thrown different ideas around for what I should do. Whether it's EFT's, commercial real estate through a BA or another residential investment property. 

Residential obviously is the most familiar but comes with a fair amount of costs and risk.
Commercial with less cost but more risk? 
And I'm still extremely uneducated on stocks in general. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thank you.",0,1637194435,97,602
Can I Contribute to HSA from a different company?,"Hey pf, 

I did a bit of googling and searching and couldn't find the answer for the situation my Fiance and I are in. I work for company A and she works for company B. We have been living together for about 4 years now (planned to get married in 2020. LOL) but we're not married yet and frankly not in a huge rush anymore since we're in the process of purchasing a new home. So, that said, we likely won't get married in 2022. 

Her company allows for domestic partners to be put on her health insurance and my company's insurance has a much smaller network for where we live. We will pay a bit more in premiums by switching me over to her insurance, but the ability to go to a hospital 2 minutes away vs 20 minutes away and be covered is worth the extra $30 a month for me. Her insurance also includes some mental health stuff which I don't have and need.

&amp;#x200B;

SO TL;DR: Is it possible for me to pay from my paychecks at company A into an HSA that is run by her insurance at company B? Or do I need to work for company B in order to do that? If this doesn't work out, we will just continue on our own separate plans for another year and individually pay into HSA's as we don't file jointly for now.

Taking out a loan against my paid off car a hood idea?,"So I am currently a 20 year old in college full time working full time. As of now I have 14,500 in a Roth IRA, 3,300 in a Roth 401k, 3,000 in a brokerage, and $5,000 in cash. I also have a car that I paid cash ($11,000) for 8 months ago. As of now I could sell it tomorrow for $12,500 easily. I plan on buying a house eventually(years away) so I’ve been stocking money into a brokerage to save for a down payment. I have zero expenses except insurance, gas, food. I’ve mostly avoided any debt but it has me thinking why I shouldn’t go to a bank and get a car loan with 2.25% interest and invest the money?

Need Help...will my renters insurance cover it ?,"My roommate saw a leak and tried to fix it by tightening the valve but the other end of pipe broke and apartment got flooded. The Apartment owner said that the damages will be billed to us because a bidet is attached to toilet.

Dependent Care FSA with Child Tax Credit 2022,"Hi, I know similar questions have been asked before but I'm trying to figure out if its worth it to open up a Dependent Care FSA for 2022.

I have multiple small investment accounts. Do I consolidate or let them grow independently,"Hi so I started using acorns awhile back using spare change every month. It has grown to almost $500 over that time. To be honest I forgot about it, autoinvesting $5 a month. Then i started crypto without knowing what i was doing and got frustrated, i recently transferred it to coinbase and have about $600+ there..earlier this year, I got into robinhood and have another $600 currently. At the same time I started robinhood I decided it was past due time for me to start an IRA and I now have $1800+ in that account. So basically I now have investments worth approx $3500 which blew my mind because I really didn't realise I had that much(I know it's not a lot but it is to me and my situation/history).

Financial input,"Hello. I am looking to see how my financial situation is looking at the moment. I am 34 years old and my wife is 36 years old. We have two young children as well. We make a combined $110,000 a year before taxes or contributions. We have a mortgage where we pay $1750 a month (we pay about $100 extra a month otherwise it would be $1650 a month). I know we can pay less on that, but I would love to get it paid off in the next 12 years and this will let me do that. 

I am listing all of our investments below, and then what my plan is after that. I would love any feedback on where we are at the moment. We have an emergency fund set up, so that’s all good to go.

- $3000 in VFIAX
- $3000 in VTSAX

- $18,500 in VTSAX



All of this comes out to be about:
70% US
20% international
10% bonds 


I think my bonds are too high, and I think I can condense my portfolio a little. When January hits, I am planning on changing some things up, while adding $6k to my Ira and another $6k to my wife’s Ira. I am thinking of moving it all to VTIAX AND VTSAX. So my thought would be….

Anyways, when I was hired on I was promised a raise after 90 days of employment at 5-7%. In all actuality I didn't receive this raise until I was nine months in with the company. Probably could have gone after them for back pay but I was genuinely just happy to have finally gotten it.

My GF's past rental and credit history is making it nearly impossible to rent a place together,"I moved into my girlfriend's tiny 1 bedroom apartment about 8 months ago (we're both early 30s, no kids), and the lack of space is starting to drive us crazy, so we're looking to upsize. Problem is, we live in a very high COL west coast city, rent is crazy expensive.

She is from an immigrant family and grew up poor, with a lot of struggles to finally get to the point of having a good career and income in the past couple years. She went through a rough patch about 4 years ago and went into debt, missed rent payments, almost got evicted, got her car repossessed. Since then, she's worked hard to get mostly out of debt and now has a solid career. On the other hand, I grew up comfortably and my parents helped me thru college and kept me debt free into my early 20s. My credit is impeccable, never missed a payment of any kind. 

We've been looking at larger places but have now been denied everywhere we apply because of her history. I honestly could afford to pay most of these places myself if I really had to, but she's like a poison pill. I've asked landlords if they'll just let me sign the lease myself, but they all have said she needs to be approved and on the lease in order to live there. Basically, no unofficial subletting.

I'm in my mid 20s and make about $100k annually. I have several debts like medical, car, and student loans that come out around $700 a month. I have about $10k in checking, $20k in a brokerage, and $60k in an IRA. My credit is pretty good at 780+.

There is absolutely nothing to rent that allows pets under $2k a month and is less than an hour commute to my new job. I'm bound to the area because of my SO and her job as well.

Here's the figures for the mortgage 
Mortgage  -- 30 year term , 3% interest rate , no penalties on early repayments 
Any lets assume I've a magic wand and will always get 8% APY for my investments

The problem she is having is with Barclays Credit Card. This person transferred money to a bank and and we have the last four of the account number but that’s it. She wants to know because this happened with another institution called Upstart and the person ended up opening a bank account in my moms name but Upstart gave her all the information and was able to call the bank and close the bank accoun (Varo Bank).

 Barclays won’t tell us the name of the bank the money from her credit card was transferred to. All it says on the statement is “transfer to checking (last four digits of checking account)” and there is also 5 digits next to the checking account which I’m thinking is a zip code.

**Since this is retirement and I won't be touching it any time soon I'm thinking about going all in on VINIX  Vanguard Institutional Index Fund Institutional Shares.  It'd be all stocks so more risk but I think that is fine for right now plus it is 0.035%. It is the only Vanguard fund available in the 403b plan.**

Who and how do I get loans for school? Unique situation inside.,"Hi everyone,

I got a full-ride to college. Normally tuition would have cost me over $100,000 alone, but I got exceedingly lucky with my situation by getting a full-ride scholarship. That said, I still need to take out loans for cost of living. I'm going to need a lot as my state and city have a high cost of living (unfortunately).

I have about $16,000 saved. Over four years for everything (rent, insurance, car, utilities), I estimate needing approximately $90,000, give or take. It's a lot of money, but I'm confident in my choice of major to justify it.

That all said, I need help knowing where to apply for loans. I have approximately $45,000 remaining FAFSA federal loans. After that, I have no idea what to consider. I've heard of Sallie Mae and similar services, but their reputations seem to be poor at best.

For what it's worth, I have a strong credit score of 765. I'm unsure of where to go from here. Any and all help would be appreciated.",0,1637188946,168,956
Mortgage Question About the 28/36 Rule,"My credit score is pretty good (780-ish), but my wife's isn't so great (640-ish).  We own a house now in Tennessee, where property taxes and home insurance rates are pretty low.  On my current mortgage, we were able to qualify solely on my income when we refinanced in summer of last year.  Taxes and insurance are paid via an escrow.

We are likely moving to Florida soon for a job promotion, and plan to buy a comparable home there, which we will probably need about a $250k-300k mortgage.  I know insurance and tax are far more expensive there, which will make it where my income alone will not be sufficient on the 28% rule (no more than 28% of your monthly Gross income should go towards housing costs) if I have an escrow on that loan too.  After we sell our Tennessee house, we will have over 20% to put down on a new house in Florida.  Based on what I've been reading, if I have over 20% down payment, most lenders will allow you to opt-out of the escrow, which will make my monthly house payment only principal and interest.  I would be responsible for directly paying the insurance and tax each year, which is fine.

If I opt-out of an escrow, the monthly mortgage payment will be below 28% of my monthly gross, but I'm not sure if a lender will actually consider that as a true ""under 28"" since they know I will have to pay taxes and insurance later.  Has anyone had experience doing this? Any loan officers in this subreddit to chime in?

I'm trying to get the best rate I can, and I know if I have to bring in her income and score on a join application, we are looking at at least a 1.5% more on the rate.",0,1637188573,311,1618

When do you hit an ROI limit with credit cards?,"So I’m a high income earner and have the trifecta of chase credit cards (daily spend, travel, business) 

I’m happy accumulating points in the various categories and pay them off every month but I fail to see the significance of getting more cards or having a limit above $50,000. My monthly expenses do not come in at even 10% of that.

I have friends that churn credit cards and bank accounts for $100 here and $300 there but that seems like an exhausting hobby to me and while I can appreciate the access to capital (i.e. if you HAD to spend a crazy amount of money), it would suck to pay back $50K+ on a credit card, and I would rather do a 401K loan or something.

My question is when do credit cards stop mattering? Did I already hit that limit? Should I get more for a reason unstated here?

We have received a pre-approval for an FHA loan but I'm worried we will run into trouble in the underwriting process.

Will the case be considered closed by my underwriter and therefore ignored, or will they still require me to contact the debt collectors and pay off a debt from many years ago (over 7 years old) before closing? The debt collectors have not contacted me about this in a long time which is honestly why I forgot about it. 

Please note that I understand that this is still a debt I owe and I will pay it. I just need to know if I will have to pay it before I can close on a house or if the underwriter will be able to ignore it because it's old and ""disposed"" of in the court.",0,1637188112,234,1224
Is it worth the hassle to transfer Traditional IRA balance into Roth IRA account now?,"Hello experts, I will first and foremost admit that I have zero financial literacy. So please be patient with me. 

My question pertains to my two Vanguard IRA accounts. They both have small amounts in them and I just want to combine them so my Mint looks more streamlined. 

I was told to start saving for retirement in high school, and with the big economic crash in 2007 many young high schoolers in my generation got freaked out by economic insecurity. So as soon as I started college, I opened a “Roth IRA” account with Vanguard. 

I have a reminder to myself every Jan 1st to transfer $5,500 from my checking account into the Roth IRA until I was no longer eligible to put money in this account due to the eligibility requirement on annual compensation. 

Then I opened a Vanguard Traditional IRA account and transferred $5,500 (more recently $6,000 - I just put in what the Vanguard website tells me I can contribute) from my checking account every Jan 1st. 

So now I have been having these two accounts on my Mint where I had been putting in extra money that I don’t want to put in savings or invest in individual stocks (I have a separate individual stocks portfolio that I do through Merrill Edge). 

Vanguard account #1: Roth IRA - has over $130k

Vanguard account #2: Traditional IRA - has almost $100k

Neither account has that much money in it and it would be aesthetically more pleasing on my Mint app to have both combined. My friend (who is much more literate in finances) told me I can transfer all my account balance from the Traditional IRA into the Vanguard Roth IRA account. He told me the only issue is that I will have to pay capital gains taxes on the money that didn’t come from my check account (so the gains). I’m fine with that, but he also mentioned that this mechanism may not exist in a year or two because this “backdoor conversion” may be eliminated by Congress. So in the end, I will still end up having to contribute to the Vanguard Traditional IRA account as I have always done but will no longer be able to then move the money to the Vanguard Roth IRA account. 

My question is, is it still worth the trouble? My friend told me it is, because the ~$100k I have in the Vanguard Traditional IRA right now can grow over the next 30-40 years and when I need to withdraw it, it will not be taxed. Also, he said I wouldn’t be forced to use the money in 30-40 years (or pay a penalty). 

I guess I’m ok with either, with a preference for fewer smattering of little accounts. But sounds like Congress will stop this practice of “backdoor transfer” anyway, and I can never be rid of the Traditional IRA account as I don’t qualify to put money from my checking directly into the Vanguard Roth IRA account, so I’m not really sure if the process is worth the hassle.

Your insights are appreciated.",0,1637187928,515,2825

14 month old toddler billed for his own delivery,"This is going to be a long one. Thanks for reading if you do, I know it's a bit of a rant. My wife and I are 25/26 and had our first child last year. I'm new to insurance, but not an idiot. Thought I had our ducks in a row but the hospital has determined to redefine shady billing..

At an early OB appointment in Feb 2020, we sat down in the office of their hospital “financial/billing specialist.” She told us a few things that later turned out to be completely untrue, but the biggest was that we would be obligated to pay my wife’s max out of pocket of $3,000 and that was it for the whole ordeal.

We hit the max out of pocket well before the baby came and didn’t get any further bills from them for her or the baby. I couldn’t afford to put the baby on her low deductible plan and he was healthy, so we went with a catastrophic plan off the marketplace. (I fall in the family glitch. PPO family coverage from my employer is $1,200+ a month for medical only.)

Baby was born healthy via C section and received no treatment other than the initial shots. Never left our sight the entire stay.

A bit over two months after the birth, we got two bills in the baby’s name. One for $1,200 for the doctor, and one for $5,600 for the hospital. Neither had his new insurance info, so I sent it off to them and waited. The insurance rep said it was very odd for that to be billed to the baby and not the mother. That she’d “never seen that before.” (This is the state’s biggest insurer talking about the state’s biggest hospital system.) The doctor bill came back under $500 and I paid it. The other bill never came back. We called billing a couple times for unrelated things, as recently as September, and they said there was no balance on her account when specifically asked.

Fast forward to Monday, a full 14 months after the birth, we get a bill for $2,500. First I’ve seen. Nothing specific on it, just a statement of account with the original $5,600 amount adjusted by insurance (who paid nothing) to $2,500. I went back and looked at baby's electronic EOBs for the period, and it does show “amount you may owe provider” as that $2,500…

I think on paper everything is acceptable, if not for the ridiculous lag time in billing. What infuriates me is 1:  their lie about billing the baby in the first place prevented us from shopping hospitals that may not have done so, 2: the 70 day lag in initial billing prevented us from finding the most appropriate medical plan (60 day window for private enrollment after life event,) and 3: telling us that our account was settled a year after the birth makes it awfully hard to budget. Should you never expect to be done with bills until the legal SOL expires? 

While I can technically afford this from emergency savings, the wrinkle is we are now newly expecting our second. Now not only do we have to pay twice as much as expected for the first child, the next one is likely also going to cost twice as much as was budgeted. We don’t have anything from the offending parties in writing of course. 

Is this normal? Do we have any possible recourse other than haggling over itemized bills? I haven’t called them yet and am not sure the best approach. So tired of feeling screwed over. I can't tell you how much time I have wasted on the phone with these people.. Thanks for your help in advance.

TL;DR Any recourse against hospital billing for birth in baby’s name, more than a year later, after saying they don’t do that?",0,1637187845,641,3468
Figuring out if I will take a pay cut going independent contractor.,"Assuming similar hours worked, as an employee at my current job I make $37.50 an hour, where as being an independent contractor with another company I will make $42 an hour. I do not currently get any benefits being an employee at where I work (such as 401k or insurance plans).

I understand that I can also deduct business expenses doing this, which is one financial benefit I get being a contractor. If it helps to have approximate weekly hours worked, and therefore an average annual income, I would just say 15 hours a week. $37.50/hr employee job = $29,250 yearly vs $42/hr contractor job = $32,760.",0,1637187678,148,808

"Wife's mother passed away, I'm trying to help her sister get into college but having financial issues","My wife’s family grew up relatively poor living in a rural area of the US.

They don’t own a house either – they are renting a mobile home. The factory no longer wanted to keep the pension so they forced the workers to take it out in cash or move it to a 401K. My wife’s father is not financially literate so he decided to take the $50K pension in cash and leave it in his checking account.

Salary increase: critique my loose budget plan!,"Hi folks! Early 20s tech worker who just reached a personal goal: six figures before 25! I'm really excited, and I know pretty much nothing is going to change about my lifestyle, but I wanted to pitch my potential plan and see what folks think.

I'm still conceptualizing the salary jump, which I know is not much more than I was making before, but hoping this sub will keep it real and let me know if my plan needs to be changed. I am paid semi-monthly (I think around $6,445 per month before 401k contribution), I live in a state with zero income tax, and I have some student loan debt to kill. I am still on my parents' health plan so no worries about factoring in insurance expenses.

Plan:

* 12% to 401K ( \~$5,500 left per month)
* Student Debt: \~$80,000, sub 3% variable interest rate. I pay $650 per month minimum plus about $400-500 per month extra now. I'm planning on bumping that up to about $800 extra per month, so a total of \~$1450 or so per month. (\~$4,050 left per month)
* Emergency savings: I am a compulsive saver and previously saved about $800-1000 per month. I'm hoping to up that to $1200 per month at least. (\~$3,100 left per month)
* Rent and utilities: $800 per month ($2,300 left per month)
* Groceries: $600 per month (\~$1,700 left per month)
* Max out Roth IRA each year, mostly done via ad hoc deposits when I can (no set deposit schedule)

My thought is that I'll have somewhere around $1,500 left per month to use on fun stuff: yoga/gym membership, travel/vacation, salon/nails/spa, etc. I figure it's important to spend at least some of my income on myself, because what's the point of making money if I won't reward myself a bit?

Upon his death, I moved into the home with the agreement that I would pay the property taxes and maintain the property while we waited some time for the property to appreciate in value (it was recently re-zoned light industrial in a quickly growing area) and to give me a place to live.

Upon my father's death, the property was titled as ""Estate of &lt;my father&gt;, &lt;my sister's name&gt;"" my name was never put on the title

We immediately sold 10 undeveloped acres to pay off a mortgage my father took out against the property. It is my understanding that this sale shouldn't have been subject to any capital gains tax since the tax basis for that is based on the date of death. Almost all of those funds were used to pay off the mortgage.

Fast forward to now, we just closed on the remaining 10 acres and home. We sold for well over the $250,000/$500,000 primary residence exemption. However, I'm a bit unclear on who, if anyone, actually gets to claim that exemption, since although I lived here I wasn't on the title and therefore legally not an owner. In that case, we would have to pay capital gains tax on whatever the increase in value since 2015 was? But how does that work when we split the property into two parcels? Would we have to have some sort of retroactive appraisal done? 

I'm very confused about what sort of tax liability I might have for this. I suppose the most simple explanation is the estate will pay CG taxes on whatever the 2015 -&gt; 2021 gain was (but how is this determined?) and then I will personally pay zero taxes as it is just a cash inheritance at that point. 

I plan to speak to a professional about this, but I wanted to get a rough idea of what I should expect here first.",0,1637184504,340,1866
Mortgages and source of funds,"Hi guys, I've got a bit of a conundrum. I'm in the process of buying a flat for 280000. I have a 5% deposit and my parents said they would gift me the other 5%.

How to determine selling a house for a profit and moving to a lower COL area?,"Hello everyone, 

I have a couple of questions about selling and was hoping to get some first-hand experience/input.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background. Almost 6 years ago I purchased a house in a large suburb outside of Chicago. The main reason for this location was it was close to where I needed to work, I was able to use Cook County programs available and a first-time homebuyer program to help me make the purchase. The purchase was for $210k and I currently owe roughly $170k. I've been quite aggressive paying things off knowing that I do want to sell and I don't want to be here long term. Fast forward a bit and now because of covid, my job is permanent work from home so there is no reason to stay in the high cost of living area with outrageous taxes so I've decided to make a move. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the cost of housing going through the roof and all our improvements and remodeling, I wanted to get an idea of where we are for value. Right now the house was appraised at $325k. Obviously, this has gone up quite a bit since my purchase, but how do I know when this is going to be my maximum value? I've thought about selling the past couple of years but the value just keeps going up and I keep thinking to myself ""if I would have sold then imagine what I would have lost."" The other issue is I feel like this is going to turn into a gamble with a lot more to lose than gain.

Should we adjust for inflation?,"Should inflation impact our plan?

Background:My wife (29f) and I (29m) have been Bogleheads for several years now and it has served us very well. We recently paused contributions to our Roth IRA (100% VTSAX) to pay down our mortgage quickly. The logic here being we will have more than enough to retire even if we never add another cent. However, we will be needing a larger home for our growing family hence why we want more equity in our current home. Probably in the next 3 years.

"how do i get old garnishment/judgement, from previous law firm , removed","hello,

quick story. i have a credit card debt that about $3700. The original judgement was won by Blatt Hasenmieller Leibsker &amp; Moore/Jefferson Capital, but it was won many many years ago. They were only legally allowed to garnish my wages one time, over a 3+ year period. Since then, Jefferson capital is now being represented by  Lloyd And McDaniel's.  Ive made a payment agreement with Lloyd &amp; M, whereas i pay monthly, until the debt is paid in full. Lloyd and M didnt file a suit against me because i agreed to payment arrangements before it got to court. 

The garnishment sent by the old (now out of business)  law firm is still attached to my employee file. Since ive agreed to pay the debt, through Lloyd, and court papers have been signed, about the payment arrangement, how do i get the garnishment off my employee file?

Where to invest before it is too late... I fear something dramatic will happen,"I(30) live in Europe (euro zone) and work for a company that works with other companies in many different sectors.

I heard some rumors that there is even a fertilizer shortage due to no urea supply so there could even be a food shortage.

Due to the high energy prices and the lack of material to produce stuff things that will be produced will be even more expensive. Some steel production companies are already on hold and I even heard that some car industry (OOOO) will be on hold for 2 months next year.

"""That guy"" asking about HSA during open enrollment","Thinking about switching from PPO to HDHP this year and starting an HSA. Just had our first kid in 2021, aren't planning on another in 2022, and we're all very healthy.

Family deducible is $1,500/$3,000  
OOP Max is $6,000/$8,000

With the HSA, my employer will contribute $1,200/year.

Professional Student Line of Credit - Debt Collection (Third Party Agency) - Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some helpful advice moving forward, as I'm in a very bad situation financially right now. This is a pretty stressful time, so please be kind. This is completely of my own doing, so not looking to make any excuses. I'm not very well informed when it comes to debt collection, so any advice would be appreciated regarding what my best options are moving forward.

I have a quite a bit of dept in general, but specifically I have a Professional Student Line of Credit with Scotiabank for $135,000 (and I live in Ontario, Canada). I graduated from grad chool approximately two years ago, which is when I had to start repaying interest on my loan. I had a very low paying job for articling and then was unemployed for a year afterwards when Covid happened. I spoke with representatives at Scotiabank and I advised them of what I was able to pay monthly, but it was only partial payments and not the full amount.

After almost a year of monthly partial payments, I recently noticed my online statement saying that my minimum payment due was the entire amount of my LOC ($126,000). I figured it was a result of me not being able to pay the full monthly amounts for such a long period of time. I hadn't received any communication from the bank regarding my loan being in default. But I also was still getting mail at my old apartment that I moved out of, and the letter could have likely been sent to that address. I called a representative today and they advised that I was required to pay the full amount by today's date as a result of my account being delinquent . She advised that they will be assigning my loan to a third party agency for collection. She also said that an agency has not yet been assigned, but likely will be by next week.

Some of the questions I have are:

\- Is there anything I should ask Scotiabank specifically regarding my loan? Since my phone call, I was doing some reading up on this. I'm unsure if my loan has actually been sold to this third party agency or written off. I also got a message through my account today (which is the date that the full amount was due) stating that they did not receive full payment for my line of credit. As such, they transferred $370.00 from my chequing account as a right of offset to bring my account back into good standing. In the message, it then listed tips about setting up recurring payments in the future. So I'm a bit unsure about the current status of my account and whether I've officially defaulted (if that's the correct terminology). Since it has not been transferred yet to the third party agency, is there any chance of trying to negotiate with Scotia to keep it with them?

\- Regarding my conversation with the collection agency when they call me, is there anything I should know prior to having that conversation or any general guidance on how to handle these types of conversations? My hope is that they would be okay with a payment plan. I now have a steady job and while I'm not making a lot, I would at the very least be able to pay $500 a month.

\- Also, I know I have a long road ahead of me when it comes to my credit and the damage that will be done (and has already been done). As I said before, I also have other debt which I haven't defaulted on (OSAP loan, credit card debt etc.). But I would like to speak to someone who can provide professional advice moving forward. I'm not sure if I should speak with a credit counsellor or a licensed insolvency trustee? And also, do you have good resources for where to find these people?

Thank you guys for taking the time to help me out. It's a tough situation and I know it's going to set me back a lot no matter what I do. But I'm just trying to put myself in the best position possible moving forward and I have no idea where to start.

Advice for handling ailing father’s finances.,"Hello to whoever is reading, I’m looking for help in the best way to handle the specifics of my situation here.

Recently my father has moved in with me following the passing of my grandmother whom he was living with.

My father has certain medical issues, that I was unaware of, which makes it impossible for him to live on his own.

These issues are primarily mental in nature, and prevent him from doing very basic tasks, such as driving, using a stove, learning new tasks and generally anything that requires fine motor skills or the use of memory…

Well the kicker of it is that my father is fairly well off. He has a sizeable sum of money in an out of state bank in the form of certificates…

Which is nice and all… except looking at these statements the returns are abysmal. We are talking somewhere between 1 and 2%, which doesn’t even keep up with inflation.

So after researching my options, I’m considering moving this money into domestic and international Index funds, most likely through Fidelity as they offer the lowest rates…

To be clear, none of this money is necessary for my fathers care. My job has a decent pay, I can handle all the bills, food etc. with money left over, and he also has a relatively sizable checking account to handle whatever minor conveniences he might need for the foreseeable future. 

My father has accepted me taking control of his finances, and my primary concern is to just put this money somewhere where I can forget about it and let it grow, as these certificates seem to be a horrible return on investment.

Does anyone have any advice as to whether there are any concerns to cancelling these certificates, or how difficult it will be to go about moving this money from there into some very stable index funds? Is it better to put it in a single account or a joint account? 

I’m sorry if these are silly questions, but I’m very new to investing in general, I have some money in crypto, and some money on Robinhood, but we are talking about sums I wouldn’t be comfortable putting into either of those locations, the type of money that’s probably best invested in old, traditional, slow growth money markets.",0,1637178351,378,2158

My dad is pushing me to go full time so that I will get healthcare and retirement benefits, but when I do the math it seems like I would be working way more hours for not much more pay and would have to deal with the hassle of trying to find a place to park a big van.  I am, currently going to college on the days I am not working and I could probably swing college plus full time work but it would be much more stressful.

Reality Check - moving cross country from HCOL to LCOL,"My husband and I are in our mid-40s, currently living in Southern California, and are thinking of moving back to our home state of Michigan.

Our current situation: 
* income of about ~$150k between the two of us. He works in academia, I’m a freelance web dev.
* Mortgage has $300k left on it; house is worth about $800-$850k
* We have about $60k across our savings and my biz account
* We have about $375k saved in retirement (mix of 401ks, IRA, etc); husband also has a small pension through his current job.
* I have about $10k in federal student loans, @ 2.75%
* No other debts - credit cards are paid off monthly, our car is paid off (although about 10 years old)

I could give the lengthy list of reasons of why we want to move back (I have a spreadsheet of all the pros and cons!), but will spare you. Mostly, we want to be back near family, and we're sick of a lot of the downsides of SoCal. Trust me - I’m aware of the downsides to Michigan as well (not looking forward to snow again), but the pros for us really outweigh the cons.

This seems like a no-brainer - moving from a HCOL place to a LCOL place would allow us to buy a pretty awesome house outright (our current home is a tiny bungalow situated on a lot the size of a postage stamp), and basically be debt-free. We’re not the type of people to suddenly overspend or live beyond our means, so while we will look for a bigger house, we’re talking like a nice ranch with 2400sq feet, not a mansion. Might get me a car - a cheap used one. We’d devote our extra funds to savings, and having some fun - travel, mostly.

Job wise, I can work anywhere and my hourly rate is high. My husband can work temporarily as an adjunct and/or take on freelancing himself until he finds a tenure-track position (MI has 30+ community colleges); if he can’t find a teaching position within a year or so, then he can always fall back on a full time programming position. We expect he will make less than he is now, and have budgeted accordingly. Our current plan is to rent until we figure out where he’s going to land a full time job, and then purchase a house at that point (which may be a year or more off).

So, questions:

* any reason that this is *not* a good idea that you can think of?
* any pitfalls we should think of and be planning for?
* is there any reason to not pay off my student loans with the proceeds of the house sale?
* We’re going to be sitting on close to half a million while we rent - should we be doing something with that?",0,1637177807,471,2498
"Looking for suggestions/feedback/critique on my portfolio weighting &amp; the ""first draft"" of my selected stocks, crytpos &amp; ETF's.","Hi folks,

I'm a 30yo M in AB, Canada, investing for the first time, so I'm a bit late to the party of investing but better late than never.

I understand the risk vs reward and I'm happy to take a big roll of the dice for bigger gains in the short term rather than put everything into a less volatile and safer portfolio.

Recieved collections letter. Not sure if I should settle or pay full amount to creditor directly.,"I have a best buy Citibank card that I missed payments on a while back. I recently received a letter from a collections agency acting on Citibank's behalf. They offered me a settlement option of less than half my debt.

I called Citi myself as I wanted to resolve this but they would only talk if I could make the full payment at the moment, which I am not in the position to do. They referred me back to the agency that sent the letter. They told me that the credit bureau that sent the letter was servicing this on behalf of Citibank and that it had not been sold. 

I want to avoid tanking my credit score more than this already may have done so I am not sure what my best move is here. I can not easily afford to make the whole payment directly to Citi today. I could make the payment plan through the credit bureau but I am worried that will destroy my credit.

How much is advisable to spend on a new vehicle?,"So I’m about to pay off my first car, a 2013 Corolla. I love the car, and it has about 150,000 miles on it.  I plan on keeping the car as long as possible, but I like to plan for the future.

A brief financial background so there’s not as many questions:

Now, I like my job for many reasons, benefits included. I make about 17$ an hour, and it’s relaxing. I plan on staying there for a while, although I plan on using my tuition assistance to go back to school online for accounting. I have no debt aside from my car and great credit.

My rent is about 600 a month and split between my fiancé and I. We rent a property from his family so rent is pretty stable. It’s a lower cost of living area.

I want to plan for another car later. I’d like another reliable Toyota but I’m unsure what I could afford on 17-18$ an hour. I’d like to spend around 15k, as I see a lot of low mileage reliable cars around that range.

Should I overpay my credit card to gather more rewards with low credit utilization?,"Hi, I'm new to US credit cards. I see that my credit card (secured) offers a bigger cashback than my debit card (both discover). So, it seems to make sense to just overpay my credit card by a lot so I can fit all my monthly spendings under 10% of credit utilization and I will maximize my credit score and the cashback bonus. Am I right?

So, if I spend $2000 per month and my credit line is $200, and I want to keep my credit utilization under 10% (which is $20), that means I need to put $1980 on it, then during the month spend $200, I will be left with $20 spent credit which is exactly 10%.

Student Loan Repayment and buying a house,"Hey all,

I graduated in 2017 and had been paying based on an income-based repayment play (REPAYE or something I believe).  The last payment I made on my loans before they went into deferral due to COVID was $177 in March 2020.

Since then I have relocated to a new state and doubled my yearly salary (to 79k).  I'm starting to look into buying a house due to skyrocketing rental and home prices (Asking for a loan of up to 280k potentially), and one of my major hold backs is how much I'll be expected to be paying back on student loans.  I'm not even sure that I would qualify for an income-based repayment plan at this point.  Deferral appears to end February 2022, and the ""estimated monthly payment"" they're giving me right now is something like $550-605 a month, if I go with the basic 10 year repayment plan.  I have options to go with 25 year plans and things like graduated cost based income payment plans, but I'd like some advice on what you all think is the best option for me.

Where should I start looking?  Any good options?  My loans are through Nelnet with a balance of $48,500.  There are 9 total loans, most range from 3.76% to 4.66%, but there is one that is 6.8%.

The second question is, how can I start chipping away at the debt in the meantime, should I start a part-time job in college? Should I find a better job in the summer besides being a waiter? I just want to start making this number lower than it is right now. Like I said 40k isn't terrible, and my parents will help slightly and allow me to live at home to really hammer the debt.

Question about pay disparity,"Hello, I'm not sure if this is the correct sub for this, let me know if it's not. 

Anyways, I work for a small community bank as a Mortgage Processor / Closer. I have been in the position for over a year. There are only 2 processor/closers, myself and my coworker who has been in banking for over 10 years (I have been in banking for 2).

I currently am making 15.89 per hour and one day I happened to see how much my coworker makes, which is ~24 per hour. We do the same job and our department has had record setting volume in closed loans.

My question is, how should I go about asking for a raise, or should I even ask for one? I understand she has been in this field much longer than me, but I feel like it is a very large disparity in pay. We get a 3% raise per year, so at this rate it would take me 10 years to get to 20 dollars per hour. What do you guys think?

Thanks.",0,1637172871,177,879
Can I Claim Company Charity Donation as a Personal Tax Deduction?,"This year my company decided to donate everyone's holiday bonus to charity. Hooray there goes $5k of my compensation going to a charity I didn't even choose.....I personally had no input into this decision. 

Wondering if I can claim this $5k as my own personal tax deduction?

But I've never been in a situation where the company was flush with cash and decided without any input to give it away to charity.

"Need out of BoA, can't decide between checking options?","Bank of America decided to suddenly start charging me monthly fees on my checking account. I guess they changed up their deposit requirements or something, but their customer service couldn't exactly explain why or how even after calling twice and waiting a collective hour for an explanation. I'm pretty much done with them as this isn't the first time I've had a problem.

I currently have an account with MidFlorida CU, but I have to use the drive thru teller because for some reason they won't approve me for ATM use. That compared with their limited options for cash deposit and bill pay means I don't really want to use them for my primary checking, and their app is rather clunky and annoying to use anyway. I consider this a nonstarter.

Since MidFlorida doesn't really fit my needs for checking, I have been doing research and come up with three options: Alliant FCU, Discover Bank, and Capital One 360. All three have no maintenance fees and a good ATM network, but none of them are really perfect. Alliant FCU doesn't seem to do cash deposits very well and it seems holds can take a while to clear, Discover cards aren't always accepted, and as for Capital One 360, I've had issues with them locking my card in the past, so I'm not sure I can trust them for daily purchases and bill payments.

I did rule out Ally which was a common recommendation here, because they don't seem to have cash deposit options aside from fee services.

I'm kind of leaning towards maybe doing a combination of Discover Bank and Capital One 360, using Discover for most purchases and having C360 as a backup account I can transfer money to using Zelle, if I run into a situation where a merchant doesn't take the Discover card. Is this a workable idea? Any potential pitfalls to this plan?

Any other options I should consider? My most pressing needs are a robust ATM system with options for cash deposit or withdrawal nationwide, free/low cost checks, no maintenance fees, quality bill pay and account transfer options, and fast ach/wire/direct deposit processing. I don't need other banking services such as savings accounts, CDs, etc, as I already maintain those accounts elsewhere.",0,1637172717,372,2175
Pay off the car or use funds to help with school?,"Better option of the two:

I read the wiki but am struggling to decide. 

Just came into $20,000.00 and am deciding on what to pay off and would like to keep some for savings.

I have have a car loan with 33 remaining months, 3.9% interest rate with monthly payments at $332.00. The current balance is ~$11,100.00.  I also am attending school which requires monthly payments of $750.00 over 10 months, no interest. I have 6 more months left for this year ($4,460). The $750 per month will continue until 2025.

Can high credit utilization for one statement drop my score 43 points?,"I (20M) have been watching my credit score like a hawk because I hope to buy a house in the next few years. I have one line of credit through my bank's credit card. (I realize that this is limiting my score from climbing higher and am looking to add more lines of credit soon). The card is through US Bank and has a $1,000 limit with few benefits, it's their standard starter card for building credit. 

Each month I spend $300 on it, wait for the statement date to pass and pay off the full balance before the due date. I know that 30% credit utilization is generally the magic number. With this pattern my score has been hovering around 742, I assume the only reason it wasn't climbing higher was short credit history and too few lines of credit. Last month I broke my pattern spent $600 on the card and still paid off the full balance before the due date. My understanding was that this would have a relatively neutral effect on my score as opposed to the usual beneficial effect of the 30% utilization. But to my surprise when I checked my November 10th credit report my score dropped 43 points, down to 699. Zero late payments, no debt, current balance is $375 with a minimum payment of $0.00 due December 1st.

Was a 60% utilization for one statement really enough to drop my score 43 points? Am I missing something? Do I need to take the stick out of my ass and relax?",0,1637172108,257,1375
Can I keep a super low interest car loan and keep paying it off after I sell the car and use all of the proceeds towards a new car?,"Hi there, 

I have a question regarding car financing. 

I just sold my car for $16,000 which is double what I still owe on it. My plan was to pay off what I owe (\~$8000) and use the rest towards buying a new car (\~$8000 for the downpayment, financing the rest.)

However, I realized that my financing for the old car was at 0.99%, and financing for a new car is 3.99%. 

Is there anything stopping me (legally)  from using the entire $16,000 towards buying a new car in cash and keeping my old car loan at 0.99%? I know that keeping the loan open means there is a lien on the car I just sold. There is 1 year 8 months left on the loan, so I would just keep paying the payments until it is paid off so it would not affect the new owner.

Advice on refinancing a rental property?,"I've been wondering if I should refinance my rental property.

Picking insurance plan with Crohn's Disease - Expensive Medication - Help me think this through.,"I have a family to insure.

$555 per month

$12,000/year family deductible

$17,000/year Out of Pocket Max

$9,000/year Out of Pocket Max

Specialty Drug Copay: 0% AFTER DEDUCTIBLE

The other copays for Physicians visits/labs/urgent care/emergency/hospital stay are in the same ball park.

I'm thinking since my drug payments, with the patient assistant reimbursements will not count towards my deductible and Janssen Carepath will only reimburse $20,000 per year, HMO #1 will be the better option. The only thing that scares me is HMO #1 having a much higher Out of Pocket Max.

Can I rollover a percentage from my husband’s HSA family contributions into my personal?,"I switched jobs and we decided that it makes more sense to go onto my husband’s health insurance.

Situation right for Roth 401k?,"I’m looking to provide advice for a family member who is a travel nurse.

Because of the nature of how travel nurses are paid, their income on their tax return looks much lower than the income they actually receive.

For example, this persons taxable income will look something like $50k in 2021 rather than the $100k+ they receive in total income through pay plus housing and meal stipends, etc.

They have the option of contributing to a Roth 401k or a regular 401k.

Is this a situation where it would make a lot of sense to contribute the full amount to a Roth IRA?

I currently work as an RN and make $70k/year. I’m due for a raise this month, which will likely bump me up to $75k/year. I have $11k left on my student loan payment. With covid it has been deferred and will kick back in in January. I own my car. I put 15% of my paycheck into retirement.

My boyfriend works in sales and made $165k this past year. He has no student loans, only a car payment.

We live together now and rent is roughly $1900/month. He pays utility/internet fees and we split everything else 50/50. No kids. I feel pretty comfortable with this arrangement. I don’t feel strapped for cash. 

HOWEVER I’m starting to freak out that I’m going to feel house poor, especially since my student loan payments are going to start up again and my entire savings will be pretty much wiped out. This also feels much more permanent, where renting at least you can easily leave once the lease is up. Although everything in this house is pretty much brand new, I’m also worried about maintenance and other unexpected costs. I brought up these concerns with him and he says we’ll be fine.

I know my boyfriend will be fine since he makes so much. I, on the other hand, don’t know how I’m going to fare.  

Am I freaking out over nothing?",0,1637165144,304,1675
Confused about retirement tax bracket? Should I NOT be using a Roth in my 20’s?,"Hi all, I’m planning for my retirement and thought I was doing everything right but the more I read about tax brackets and Roth’s the more confused I get. Currently I’m in my mid 20’s and am making around 100k a year. Everything I have read says if you’re young use a Roth account, so I’m exclusively funding a Roth IRA and my companies Roth 401k.  
 
My question is, as someone who’s doing fairly well of for my age group, is there a large potential my tax bracket actually goes *down*?? My basic understanding is my income in retirement is Medicare + whatever I pull out of my retirement accounts, but most estimates I see are less than 100k per year.   

Should I be blending my investments or moving them completely out of Roth accounts?",0,1637165115,139,741
"Buying a home. ""Low"" Income.... large Inherited IRA? HELP!","Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in an interesting situation and I need your help as the home loan folks are not giving any help or advice at all. (And the advice we have been given is dubious at best)

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are looking to purchase a home (Child on the way, rental market is shit, want something a bit more permanent). Upper limit would be about $420,000... however, our financial situation is kind of interesting and we're both in the STEM fields and honestly know next to nothing about personal finance, home buying etc. Below I'll list out some of our relevant financials and Id love any advice on what to do / home to buy a home!

\- Credit Score: we both have very good credit scores that are over 750

\- Income: I am a Ph.D. candidate and my stipend is \~21,000 per year. My wife is a psychologist and owns her own private practice, however in 2020 took home about 70,000 (first year running her own private practice... lots of expenses). In 2021, now that her business is up and running, she is expecting to bring home \~130,000. So our income is... meh?

\- Inherited IRA (IRA BDA): My parents have passed and they left me an inheritance in an IRA-BDA (inherited IRA). As of today the total amount in that is $600,000+ invested in a variety of different funds. My mandatory deduction from this account is about $10,000 a year (depending on the market) and this is part of my income. 

\- Rollover IRA: Prior to going back to school for my Ph.D., I worked at a company with a 401k match program. Upon leaving, I rolled this account over into a Rollover IRA and it is now worth $50,000+ invested in mostly tech stocks

\- Random investment account: As of today work about $9000, again mostly tech stocks

\- Cash on hand: $50,000

&amp;#x200B;

So we're in a position where the income we show each year is low for what we are wanting to purchase, but we do have great credit and money in a variety of different accounts. 

The home loan woman we have been working with suggested that we set up a trust with that IRA BDA with some of the funds. She also suggested that I increase my annual deduction from the account to $40k per year. I am uncomfortable with doing either and it seems like a weird suggestion.

Investing downpayment in VASIX - bad idea?,"I have cash for a 20% downpayment on a home in my area. I'm not ready to buy now due to family circumstances but will likely want to buy in 1-5 years. Given the inflation situation, I seems unwise to keep those funds in a savings account. I want to invest the cash to (a) preserve value in the face of inflation (b) allow for possibility of modest growth of capital depending on the market next 1-5 years and  (c) minimize downside in a crash.

I'm planning to invest the entire amount in [VASIX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VASIX) - which is a vanguard conservative allocation fund with 20% stocks and 80% bonds.
I'm leaning towards VASIX based on [these](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_\(1_year\)) [two](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_\(5_years\)) boglehead pages that indicate that VASIX beats inflation and money market return 95% of the time. It's worse downturn was a 12% loss and it recovered in 18 months. (on a 5 year term)

I'm wondering if VASIX is the right move here. It seems to emphasize income generation for people who are using the fund in retirement. I am mid-career and not interested in the income, moreso the preservation and hopeful growth of capital. I do have separate emergency funds and retirement investments beyond this amount, so it's safe to consider this investment in isolation from my overall financial picture.

I don't really have anyone in my circle to bounce this idea off of. Any critique of this plan? Is there a different, conservative fund I should consider that's focused more on capital appreciation instead of income generation (to lower ongoing taxes)? I should add that having come of age in 2008/09 right now feels so much like a bubble that I'm scared to invest at all, but the above plan seems like a good compromise between my risk aversion and the possibility that, hey – this party could keep going for ten more years!",0,1637165030,309,1998
Buying cheaper house temporarily while I decide other factors?,"Rent is getting ridiculously expensive where I live and a mortgage would be around 40% cheaper overall.

I don't wish to stay in this state, but I'm considering on buying a cheaper home just for the sake of saving faster for a house in a location I actually want. So I would stay in it for 3-5 years and sell it off when I found a place in the location I wanted. I have decent credit with a few outstanding medical bills, but otherwise student loans/car loans have always been paid on time.

This would be about a year from now if I were to purchase, but wondering if anyone is considering the same thing or done the same thing? If so, did you run into any issues? What are some other factors to consider?

I'm in the dark about the home buying process, so I'm unsure if a turn around time that short is worth it. Thoughts?",0,1637165012,155,823
"Worried about my dad's future, I need advice!","So my dad is a 55 year old landscaper, who maybe has less than 10k saved up, nothing else. He and my mom own a house, which only has about $3k left to pay off the house. My dad is worried that he only has a couple of years left to save up money before he can no longer work and trying to save up as much as possible. I informed him that there are 401ks and other tools that can help in that. The thing is he's not tech savvy at all and doesn't speak/understand English well, so him doing it on his own is hard. I need advice/guidance on what you all think would be the best plan for him at this point? He's self employed BTW, and he's never worked for another company in the past 20 yrs. Also, he doesn't have any debt, except the house. He may have bad credit cuz some stuff did go to collections in the past.

From what I've been reading in the wiki, a solo 401k or IRA would be his best bet? If he does open one, is it okay to open one with any bank? He currently has a bank account with Wells Fargo, I think I read on their website you can open one there. He wants to save aggressively.

Pending hold on my debit card,"So I rented a car 2 months ago through Enterprise while traveling abroad. Unfortunately I had to use my debit card instead of a credit card for the authorization hold, so I was basically stuck with a pending ""withdrawal"" (almost $1,900) for the security deposit or whatever.

I've called Enterprise countless times (they're supposedly unable to fix it themselves because it occurred abroad) and my bank isn't helpful either (local credit union, Visa card).

Wanting to move money from savings account into some sort of investment fund... good idea?,"Little background: I'm 31. When I first started working around 20, I made a habit of ""spending what I don't save"", and built up a nice little nest egg in a savings account pretty early, about $15,000. Unfortunately, due to a variety of reasons, I stopped when I was 25, and the money has more or less just been sitting there. A few years ago I did move it into a money market account so that it would earn _something_, but the promotional rate has long ended and now I get ~$5 per month interest on it.

I want to do something with it. I've always known just leaving it reduces the value due to inflation, but now with inflation rising it feels like even more of a bad decision not to touch it. I've always kept it around in an easy to access savings account ""just in case"", the old ""keep 3 months expenses handy"", but I've never touched it, and it's just... not doing anything. I would like to invest it.

Should I just throw it all into an S&amp;P index fund? Should I throw it into my (moderately aggressive) Acorns account? Should I split it out into different index funds?

I'm not looking to actively manage this money, just put it somewhere that it can grow, and maybe add to it every now and then. S&amp;P index fund seems like the best bet, but just curious if there's anything else I should be considering.

Tips for helping a parent assess their financial health/prepare for retirement?,"My (divorced) mom has expressed an interest in getting together a big picture view of her finances and is open to the idea of myself and/or my brothers helping her sort through that. She'll be 60 next year and is in ""okay"" health. Through most of the 00s she was running her own business and supporting herself/my brothers and I via child support and alimony, and I don't think she put much into retirement savings.

My main question is what are the key questions to ask, account types to look for, etc.? I know she has a life insurance policy with a long term care rider, a 403(b), and some stock in the company her ex-husband worked for. She also has a mortgage and, due to some repairs at her house, said that last year she cut her retirement contributions down significantly to pay for upkeep.

Additionally, any tips for how to address the alimony angle? I don't know how these arrangements typically work, but it's no secret in our family that dad is retired and his net worth is probably in the mid-8 figures so even if she's receiving a generous amount it's not like it's impoverishing another party.

Lastly, if we determine that she's way off course from being able to retire in the next 5-10 years, what are some things we can do to prepare for the possibility of supporting her. Are there particular financial vehicles available for elder care or should we simply plan to have cash on hand to help her with expenses?",0,1637163832,255,1428

Should I look at selling my car?,"I bought my 2016 Mazda 3 with 18k miles as a certified pre-owned back in 2018 for $16,800. At the time I put down $5,000 cash and financed the rest. 90 days after the initial purchase my local credit union took over the loan at a lower interest rate of 3.25%. My wife and I have been aggressively paying on my car to pay it off as it is our highest interest rate debt currently. As it stands I only have $5100 left on the car and my current budget slates me paying it off by 3/1/2022. To head off any additional questions, we have a fully funded 6 months emergency fund and are actively overpaying on debts to pay them off sooner.

I hadn't really considered selling my car because I do enjoy the car, it's the manual transmission and it's just fun to drive. However, I accepted a new job 4 months ago in which I am now 100% remote and was a 50% salary increase over my old position. So needless to say my car now gets driven pretty infrequently, as such the mileage is only 29,500. Any trips out of town etc we use my wife's SUV. My car is garage kept and I enjoy taking care of it and keeping it clean etc as I enjoy having a ""nice"" car where previously I had some beaters.

For the heck of it I did a Carvana quote to purchase my car yesterday and they came back with a quote of $21,369 to outright purchase the car. If that holds true I could essentially pay the car off and have close to my original purchase price back. My wife is encouraging this and pushing me to buy a $6,000-$10,000 vehicle and then the remainder of the money can be thrown at some of our other debts. Also, a replacement car could be lower insurance coverage for further savings.

I'm at a loss, my heart says keep the car as I enjoy it. My brain says to sell and make good financial decisions.

30 years old. Starting to max out my Roth IRA this year (no 401k) - Help me decide portfólio for taxable brokerage account.,"I have a Vanguard Roth IRA, 70% VTI, 30% VXUS. I am late to the retirement game (1.2k), so this will be the first year I’ll max out my Roth with 6k. 

I also have a (aggressive) acorns account that has 1.2k in it that I am only contributing $5 a week, and roundups (no multipliers) . I pay a $1 per month fee for acorns. Until I figure out what to do with my brokerage account, I am not sure if I’ll start investing more in acorns or even use it at all. 

(Emergency fund of 10k in a HYSA 0.5%)

My next step is to invest 20k into a taxable brokerage account. I was considering Schwab before, and still am. But also thinking about doing vanguard again for simplicity. 

My confusion arises when I think if my  portfolio options from the bigger picture. 

The 20k in the taxable brokerage account possibly could be used for a down payment on a house 5-7 years down the road. But as I research more about investing long term. I’m starting to think that with me investing that 20k, more money will be made in the coming years that we can use as a down payment (my wife will start nursing school soon, so in a few years she will be getting a good salary)

My income after bonuses is about 75k, and household income is about 85k (me 30m, wife 29f, and 3 year old son)

SCENARIO 1:
Let’s say this money is invested for the long run (15-20+ years), what etfs would make sence in the taxable brokerage account? Based on my research doing something like VOO wouldn’t make sence, since a lot of those companies are in VTI (my Roth). What are some other LONG TERM options for my taxable account?

SCENARIO 2:
Shorter term investing (7 ish years)- would something like VOO make sence? Should I throw something in there with VOO to diversify like maybe a small cap growth etf (VBK) or maybe a international small cap etf (VSS)?

For simplicity, I’m more asking about how these options will work together with my Roth IRA options, even tho it’s possible it may be somewhat short term or possibly long term.

Is copying my Roth options in my taxable a possibility (70% VTI and 30% VXUS)?

TLDR
Help me choose options for my taxable brokerage account. Already doing 70% vti and 30% VXUS in my Roth IRA. May be short term (7 years) or may keep it long term due to income increasing a lot in next few years.

Tax implications of withdrawing investments for home buying,"I want to buy a home in 5-10 years.

Tax gross-up for relocation benefits,"I'm receiving some relocation benefits (part of it is a good chunk of cash) that has a tax gross-up. My understanding with gross-ups is my employer will pay the withholding taxes on the amount of the relocation benefit, and this amount that they pay could be equal, more, or less than the actual amount of taxes that I'll eventually owe on the benefits. 

In my description of benefits, my employer said if the gross-up is an underpayment of my actual taxes, then I would be responsible for the difference, and if the gross-up is more than my actual taxes, then I get to pocket the difference. Is this how it's normally done? 

Obviously,  it would benefit me if the gross-up is more than what I would actually owe, but how can I ensure that this happens? My employer didn't mention how they compute the withholding rate for the relocation gross up. Does anyone know how this is computed or is it very employer specific? 

I think I'm receiving about $60k in total relocation benefits, so I want to try to minimize the chance of me having to pay additional taxes on these.",0,1637159254,193,1072

I've been saving recently towards the deposit on a mortgage with my partner. Its Early stages at the moment and we aren't looking to move forward on anything until atleast the end of next year.

Should I refinance with cash out to pay off debt?,"Home values have sky-rocketed and interest rates have dropped.

Part year resident PA to MN,"Hello everyone this year I moved from PA to MN for a new job. I’m trying to understand how much I’ll be hit for on taxes in 2022 tax season. And how it’s calculated. Minnesota is bracket based like federal. 

So it’s a mess, I lived in PA, and worked in NJ. Now I moved to MN for work a few months ago. My wife was working we both worked. Now I only work for now until my wife finds a new job. 

So PA/NJ have agreement I only have to file PA since I lived there you file and owe where you lived. PA is flat 3.07% then you pay local which ranges based on your county. I’m not worried about that as much because 95% was withheld for PA and local. I’ll owe maybe $100-200 to PA and should break even on local or owe $10. Federal we should be ok with as well might get little refund. 

Minnesota is what I’m worried about because now I’m having taxes withheld and MN is bracket based like federal. And i don’t think it’s withholding enough because it doesn’t know what my wife made before and all that. So I guess my question is how does this work. 

Will Minnesota look at total income what we submit for federal gross between what wife and I made all 12 months or will they only look at what I made while living in MN? I know I’ll only owe income based on what I made MN but how is bracket calculated? I’m worried I’m under withholding as I selected married joint which I think will be fine starting January 1 when it’s just me having income until wife finds job. But right now i only have a job but she made income in PA for 9 months. I have three paychecks left until 2021 ends so I want to adjust withholding to help if I can even tho it’s hard now cause single income. 

I Always do our taxes myself this year I’m going to have to pay TurboTax or pay a professional I’m hoping to do TurboTax so it’s cheaper. I usually use credit karma but I can’t this year because they only allow single state filing but starting next year I can.

"Me and my husband are about to purchase a condo, are we signing up for financial ruin?","Me and husband live in the Austin, TX area. We makes a combined 225k a year. We expect our salary to increase over the next few years. We have about 118-115k left in student loans with the max interest rate of 4%. This is the only current debt we have.

We have rented for the past 5 years as we went through job changes, cross country moves, etc.

We like the location we live in and feel confident we will stay in the area in the next 5 years, but who can really predict the future?

Our monthly take home savings after considering our mortgage, PMI, prop tax, HOA fees, and student loans min payment plus all of our other average required expenses will be about $3k-4k.

Another thing to note is that our lease does not end until middle of next May.

Lastly, the unit were under contract for is in a great location but we are still assessing the competency of the HOA. For example, the unit has some wind damage which resulted in broken shingles. The seller cannot fix them because they have to request permission from the HOA to do so. This will be probably about $500-800 in repairs. 

We will have about 6 months of emergency funds after the purchase if we go through with it. Still feels too risky.

The market in Austin is ass for the $300-500k which is what we could comfortably afford. Unfortunately, we also have some constraints as me and my husband work on opposite sides of town, and neither of us want a 30 min commute. We could wait and start looking again in Jan/Feb, but I’m worried housing prices/rates will rise.

Where does non-qualified deferred compensation rank in the flow chart?,"My employer is offering non-qualified deferred compensation as a new benefit. This would allow me to put pretax money in the same investments as my 401k which is a really good 401k plan. It’s a separate account though and I can defer payments to any time I choose. 

The only downside is the risk associated with company bankruptcy (as far as I can tell) but this company has been around for over 100 years and is doing quite well even still.

So where does this rank, max 401k, HSA, then Roth IRA seems obvious, but after that this seems better than a taxable account and potentially better than other options.

Worried about parent’s retirement. Ages 67 and 60,"I recently had a serious conversation with my parents about their finances and their plans for retirement and now I’m very worried. 

They have no debt aside from a remaining balance of 4K on my moms car. Their house is paid for and is worth about 350-400K. 

My dad is 67 and retired. He has about 350k spread into a few different investments/401k. He gets a $200 a month dividend check from some stocks he inherited. He also draws social security that nets about $1600 a month after taxes. 

My mom is about to be 61 and will not be able to draw social security for full benefits at 67 (I don’t think she necessarily plans on retiring at that age yet anyways). She will be eligible for half of what my dad brings home under the ‘stay at home spouse’ benefit which will net her about $800 a month after taxes. She has 4 credits towards SS out of the necessary 40. She started working last year as a nanny and nets about $30K a year after taxes. She has $12K saved in her bank account. 

My mom does not have any retirement or investment funds on her own but does have $32K in inheritance from the sale of her mothers house just sitting in her bank savings account. She needs to invest this but I’m not sure how exactly to tell her to do so. 

Any advice on what her best options are for investing this money and growing it over the next few years?

It's because we haven't lobbied for it. For our mental and physical health we should lobby for vacation tax advantaged accounts. This will encourage us Americans to fund and TAKE vacations and will help the workforce in the longer term.

Wallet stolen and $1270 spent from HSA Debit Card: What are my best steps?,"Hi r/personalfinance

My wallet was stolen overnight from my car (it was stupid for me to leave it in the glove box.) When I noticed that my wallet was missing, I checked my bank accounts to see whether any money had been spent. There was a $5 charge at a Safeway from my main bank's debit card. I deactivated all of the cards that I could remember being open.

At 7:30pm that evening I got a text from Optum Bank, my Health Savings Account provider, that two  charges had been made totaling $1270 at two separate Target stores. I must have had a debit card for my HSA in my wallet and forgotten about it. I immediately called Optum, reported the charges as fraudulent and asked how to go about reimbursing my money. The call rep told me that Optum's risk and fraud departments would launch an investigation lasting 7-10 business days and they would call me back.

I called my local police station and the call rep told me to file a police report to have a paper trail of the fraudulent charges and to get a credit freeze. My driver's license was in the wallet, but I'm not sure that a credit freeze is the wisest move given that I am 24 and I may want to open new lines of credit in the next year. I compromised and ordered a credit fraud alert through Experian so that the thief would need to verify identity before opening new lines of credit in my name. 

I feel vulnerable and afraid of making the wrong move. What should I do to protect myself and recover the $1270 loss? Will the fraudulent spending trigger a tax penalty since it was from my HSA and spent on non-health items? Serious thank you to anyone who is able to help in the comments.",0,1637141426,308,1649

He then tells me that there's one car i could get, that being a used 2017 Ford Fusion SE listed at $17,000. We test drive it, everything goes great, he then comes back with a form showing us how much each payment would be, saying he would take $1000 dollars off since we're young and he wants to help us with building credit. The form was a list of down payments and how much the monthly bill would be based off what we paid. It was said to be $480 a month for 72 months.

Thinking about higher-risk investments,"Let me preface this by saying I have read the wiki many times, spent many years lurking here, and owe it a great deal of my success. Thank you r/PersonalFinance .

I am in my young twenties, from a poorer immigrant family (i.e. no safety net), making $210k (salary + public RSUs) in Seattle. Net worth is ~$300k ($370k invested, $70k in lower-interest loans). Roughly 1/4 of these investments are in safer ETFs and stocks. 3/4 of it is in various cryptocurrencies that I have been holding for 2+ years (so I will be taxed 15%). This is a throwaway account.

I am considering selling off about $100k or so of my crypto holdings to diversify my portfolio somewhat and put it to use somewhere else. I would retain $200k+ of crypto, over 50% of my portfolio. I am not willing to pull out any more money from crypto. My loans are low-interest and not much of a concern.

I am grateful to have the luxury of chasing high-risk investments, and after weighing my age and potential risks, I am considering some. I have been reading up on the following:

• Marked up pre-IPO shares (e.g. SpaceX)
• Seattle real estate (although the market is terrible right now)
• Cryptocurrency mining farm (well within reach, I am a software engineer with some additional experience in crypto)
• Probably a reach, but startup funding/angel investing

Help Choosing PPO vs HDHP,"Hoping I can get some advice on picking a PPO health insurance plan vs HDHP (w/ an HSA). 

The prevailing wisdom I tend to see online is that if you expect to have high expenses, go with the PPO but if you think you'll have low expenses then go with the HDHP. I've been trying to do the math and I always come up with the HDHP on top (even ignoring the tax benefits and with high medical expenses for my family of four). I'm leaning that way as a result but don't want to miss anything.

My impression is that it's because the savings on premiums is so significant between the plans and the HDHP actually has a LOWER out of pocket max than the PPO. 

Really appreciate any thoughts - my stats are below.

&amp;#x200B;

* Family: Myself (healthy), Spouse (significant medical condition w/ ongoing care), 2 healthy kids
* Normal # of office visits for myself and two kids (a few per year each) - did the math and came out with a guess of 38 office visits for the year for my spouse at \~$7,000 total cost 
* No medications for myself or the kids - about $1,350 / month total cost for my spouse if there were no insurance (and believe the medication qualifies as ""tier 2"" so it would not be at the 30% / $250 rate below for ""specialty"" drugs)
* No planned major expenses but my spouse has been hospitalized twice in the last few years at around $15k total cost each time and potential to be recurring

Deciding between buying a house vs renting and investing in stock.,"I'm trying to decide between buying a house vs renting and investing into stocks/index funds. I'm very torn and have been going back and forth between the two options:  
\- If I buy a house, I'll need to set out a large amount of money to go into the down payment and closing costs. With the house, I'll have to pay mortgage but at least it'll go toward the house and help me build equity. I can also house hack or rent out part of the house (while living there) to generate money that can go toward my mortgage. The house value might also appreciate over time but this is not guaranteed. There is also a risk of a price correction considering the current market and how price has shot up in the past two years (but maybe not so much of a risk if I'm buying for long term?)  
\- If I continue to rent, the downside is paying rent every month but I'll have more cash available to keep investing in stocks/index funds. Plus stocks have greater liquidity and seem less risky.  
Which one is a better financial decision (in the short term/long term)? Is there anything missing that I should take into account?",0,1637132698,209,1105

1)I started at an average score of 500 to 520 depending on the formula and bureau at the end of 2019 beginning of 2020. 
2)I have a secured credit card through discover with a limit of $2,000.00 it will be a year old in December.  
3)I have an unsecured card through a credit union limit of $2,500.00 about 4 months old. 
4)I got a saving loan through credit strong it’s a $1,000.00 2 year maturity. 
5)I have an auto loan of $28,xxx.xx @ 72 months with a co-signer (fiancé). 
6)Added as an authorized user on a 11 year old card with a limit of $18,500.00. 
7)I am, in a rehabilitation program for my student loans. It will remove all negative remarks (late/charge-off) and it will give me a better interest rate a bunch more. 

Fast, forward to now I am sitting 600 to 650 depending on formula and bureau.

"Second day of new job, found out that their type of work is not what they say they do, (software engineer)","So I was going through some training today with the team leader on the project, source code, workflow. I found that they are using different language than they said they do on the interview. First of all, I am capable of doing it, but just not as good. I am not angry about this because they paid me well (a level above my experience) and the environment  is pretty cool.  But it certainly will not help my career in long term as I may probably not get much of experience on things that I want to do.

Detail for SW:

They said they wanted someone who is very good at c++17\20, with experience on embedded Linux. I thought it’s like building c++17 code for embedded linux systems. But no, they actually meant they wanted someone to write c code for a tiny microprocessor, while also know c++17 code for completely different platform for something else. And also turned out that they have already shifted  alway from this c++ route between the time they posted the opening to my first day. So all I will do is c, not c++.

Background. We own a house worth 750k~ and owe 220k on the mortgage. We also own another house worth about 400k with 300k on the mortgage. In addition to this we have two new cars and managed to rack up a LOT of credit card debt (about 60k).


We’ve been struggling with our monthly payments and want to refinance the 750k home to pay off all of our credit cards and car loans.


Do we have to somehow come up with the money to pay our debt down to 35-40% DTI to qualify for the refinance?

He got multiple multi fam homes. That’s a lot of mortgages to be on the hook for in case tenants don’t pay or can’t get it rented. With average returns being 3% a year, what’s the point of all this risk? He could have put the same money in ETFs and gotten 10 % return per year and invest less time.

seasoned money problem (and solution?),"I'm trying to get a mortgage application accepted, I close on my house in 61 days. I transferred down payment money to my checking account, it just arrived today.  The money was bitcoin sales which underwriters do not like at all.  I don't have time for two statements worth of seasoning. So I'm in a pinch.  My loan officer recommended discreetly that I could get a gift to get around the seasoned money problem. 

So my thought is that I could do a gift letter with my parents, they have money and could show a brokerage statement if required to show they have seasoned funds available for gifting.  After the mortgage application is accepted I could gift my parents the down payment and they could gift my down payment directly to the title company or to me, however that'll work.  It seems like a loophole, but it does give the lender extra assurance that down payment funding is well seasoned and secure, so it's not totally pointless.  I can see it looking a bit suspicious though, but is it? As far as I know, the gifts would exceed the yearly gift limit for tax purposes, but not be remotely close to the lifetime limit, so there shouldn't be tax implications other than reporting the gifts.

Investing downpayment in VASIX - bad idea?,"I have cash for a 20% downpayment on a home in my area. I'm not ready to buy now due to family circumstances but will likely want to buy in 1-5 years. Given the inflation situation, I seems unwise to keep those funds in a savings account. I want to invest the cash to (a) preserve value in the face of inflation (b) allow for possibility of modest growth of capital depending on the market next 1-5 years and  (c) minimize downside in a crash.

I'm planning to invest the entire amount in [VASIX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VASIX) - which is a vanguard conservative allocation fund with 20% stocks and 80% bonds.
I'm leaning towards VASIX based on [these](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_(5_years)) [two](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_(1_year)) boglehead pages that indicate that VASIX beats inflation and money market return 95% of the time. It's worse downturn was a 12% loss and it recovered in 18 months. (on a 5 year term)

I'm wondering if VASIX is the right move here. It seems to emphasize income generation for people who are using the fund in retirement. I am mid-career and not interested in the income, moreso the preservation and hopeful growth of capital. I do have a separate emergency funds and retirement investments beyond this amount, so it's safe to consider this investment in isolation from my overall financial picture.

I don't really have anyone in my circle to bounce this idea off of. Any critique of this plan? Is there a different, conservative fund I should consider that's focused more on capital appreciation instead of income generation (to lower ongoing taxes)? I should add that having come of age in 2008/09 right now feels so much like a bubble that I'm scared to invest at all, but the above plan seems like a good compromise between my risk aversion and the possibility that, hey – this party could keep going for ten more years!",0,1637125008,310,1996
Am I getting crappy refi offers because I don't owe enough?,"I keep hearing about people getting 2.5% or less, but I've entered all my info with multiple banks and I keep getting rates that are either HIGHER than what I'm already paying or not enough lower to compensate for closing costs.

401K Match vs ESPP,"My company offers 401K matching up to the IRS maximum (that is, they'll match 50% of every dollar up to $19,500 in 2021).

Only Medical Debt - Worth paying for Credit Score?,"My credit score is \~710; wondering which of the following scenarios I should take if I plan to buy a house in the next few years:

"Swamped with an onslaught of bills, any advice on how to handle it?","I don't usually use reddit but was advised to ask here to, well, get some advice.  First of all, I only make $12.45/hr working about 40hrs a week, however, I don't know how long that 40hrs will last as I'm a part-time retail employee and things can change at the drop of a hat.  My parents also help me pay for some of my bills but I don't want to have to rely on them much as they're struggling as well.

Last year started my journey into more severe debt as I ended up with a $4k+ dental bill.  I used a CareCredit Card to pay it off at the time and had been doing well on it, paying off about $300 a month.  However, there were about three times when I was only able to make the minimum payment leaving me with now three paychecks left to pay back the remaining of one segment that totals about $850.  This wouldn't be so bad if I didn't also have more medical bills to pay and emergency surgery to pay for my three year old cat.

My back is all sorts of messed up that I'm suspecting has something to do with my retail job but there's no real way I can prove it.  I'm on my feet almost 8 hours straight practically every day and my shoes are fine but regardless, I've ended up with yet another $900 bill in the span of less than two weeks.  From urgent care, to doctors and specialists, to physical therapy, it added up *fast.*  I'm currently on a payment plan and my parents are paying about $60/month to help me pay it off but I don't want this hanging over my head and want to be able to help pay it off more.  Because of this bill, I've also had to cancel my mental health therapy appointments because I simply cannot afford to go into more medical debt.

Then there's my cat who needed emergency surgery just this past Sunday night/Monday morning racking up a total of about $2.3k.  I couldn't lose my baby boy, I had no choice.  I ended up putting it on my CareCredit card so I'll have a year to pay that off meaning that I'll have to pay about $200 a month for that.  Though, I may end up just paying $200 per paycheck (I get paid bi-weekly).

Then, come February will be student loan payments once again.  I'm about $14k in the hole for that still and, if I remember correctly, I was paying about $260/month.

In addition to that, I have a prior commitment payment of about $100 due each month until February and I pay $100/month for my health insurance (my parents help me pay for the health insurance).

I honestly don't know what the math would even be to figure out how much I should be paying a month/per paycheck and it scares me.  I'm trying to sell things that I own in order to pay things off but no one is biting and I'm worried that things will just continue to get worse.  I've had to cancel my physical therapy appointments as well as my upcoming doctor visits for my back problems simply because I cannot stomach the thought of having more to pay back, especially since physical therapy is costing me about $80 per visit.

I'm trying to take this one step at a time but it's just so overwhelming and I don't even know what to do aside from going to work and trying to sell things.  

To those who have read my whole story, thank you.  Can someone give me some advice or anything about all this?",0,1637124110,627,3220

Dentist Worked on Wrong Tooth (USA),"Hey there everyone,

Tldr at the bottom.

Please feel free to remove if this breaks any rules.

So against my better judgement I went to a chain dentist's office and did not have a great experience. 

Throughout the process of this I have learned the numbers of teeth so for simplicity I will refer to them as their numbers. The dentist and I did not refer to the teeth by their numbers.

Tooth 30 was bothering with me, nothing major, just some discomfort if I didn't brush for an extended period of time. It got progressively worse to the point it was really bothering me so I scheduled an appointment with the local chain dentist. 

Obligatory, tooth 31 had a small chip in a filling from a long time ago, but had been this way for 8+ years with no pain whatsoever

They took the x-rays and when the dentist looked at them, he immediately said ""oh I see, it's the one all the way to the back (which I now know is tooth 31). 

I informed him that no, that tooth (31) had been like that for almost a decade and has never given me an issue. It was actually the tooth right in front of it that was giving me an issue (30).

He then went into my mouth and told me that yes, now that's he's in there he can see what I am talking about with the tooth that is giving me pain (30) and that it is pretty bad and deep. It will probably need a root canal. I've had 1 root canal before and the progressive pain this time was similar to the one last time so I wasn't too shocked. And I knew that if I did get one, my tooth would be good to go. Wasn't too concerned with costs because I have pretty good dental insurance. I then went back to the hygienist for my cleaning. 

After my cleaning they said that I could get in for the root canal right then if I could stick around. I said sure, why not.

He numbs me up like Watley did Cosmo and says he's gotta clean the tooth out and starts drilling. As he's cleaning it out, he's hopeful and says ""looks like it's actually not as deep as I thought and I don't think we're gonna need to do a root canal. Just gonna need to crown it.""

(I now realize that crowns are the $$ makers. What happened to fillings?)


(Also the whole time he was working on me, he was gossiping with his hygienest about another hygienest, which was super unprofessional, but also kind of funny.)

 I digress...

""No root canal, effin' A!""

Anyway, I leave the office with a temporary crown and a $600 bill. (Total of $1,200, insurance covered half). I'm supposed to go back beginning of December to get the permanent crown put on. The receptionist signed me up for this interest free credit card if paid within 6 months and that's what the balance went on. 

Then this is when things get weird. 

The anaesthetic wears off in the next 12 hours then the pain sets in for about another 24. My mouth is still super tender and as I slowly am able to feel my teeth with my tounge without pain, I notice that HE CROWNED THE WRONG TOOTH!

He crowned tooth 31 when we specifically discussed how tooth 31 doesn't bother me, it's tooth 30 that is giving me problems. 

I looked at my paperwork and it does say he worked on tooth 31, but I had no idea what that meant at the time lol. 

I don't feel comfortable going back to this dentist, but $1,100 of the $1,200 bill was for this crown that the dentist put on a tooth that was not bothering me. 

I plan on going to the office and letting them know what happened and that I will not be returning for anymore service. That I will be disputing the claim to my insurance and to the credit card when the first bill arrives. I've never had anything like this happen before though so thought I should get as informed as possible before progressing.

My question would be, has anyone ever dealt with something like this before? and if so, what did you do and what was the outcome?

What could happen for not paying back a “cash advance”,"I cannot add screenshots but I will copy and paste the text. I took out several cash advances from an app on my phone. And I recently read the fine print when I realized I couldn’t pay it back yet. Here is the fine print:

“Remember that you have no obligation to repay any Instacash advance you receive but you won’t have access to additional Instacash advances until you have repaid all of your previous advances and related Tips and Turbo Fees. “

“It's important to know that when you miss a payment, we will continue to attempt to repay your Instacash advance and any related Tips and Turbo Fees from your eligible accounts as long as your payment authorizations for those accounts remain active. You can withdraw the payment authorizations on your accounts or debit cards by following the prompts in the app”

“WILL INSTACASH℠ AFFECT MY CREDIT?

No! We don’t do any sort of credit pull during or after an Instacash request. We don’t engage in debt collection relating to Instacash advances. We don’t sell unpaid advances to a third party. And we don’t report your repayment history to a credit bureau.”

“Instacash advances are not loans. You have no obligation to repay an advance and may revoke your payment authorizations at any time up to at least three (3) business days (business days are Mondays through Fridays, excluding bank holidays) before a repayment date. However, you will not be eligible for additional Instacash advances until you repay your previous Instacash advances and any related Tips and Turbo Fees.”

So upon reading all of this in the terms, I felt like I could go to my bank and cancel my debit card that they have (as they wouldn’t let me delete it in the app 3 business days before it was due like they said). And I ordered a stop payment through my bank against them. So what is the actual catch here? Am I going to be in deep shit??",0,1637120804,327,1869

Company screwed up my 401k...again,"State: California

Signed up for company 401K in July, found out end of Oct that they weren't deducting/contributing when I called to see what I would need to max out for the year.  After a couple weeks, they finally fixed it by doing what the IRS required (50% of missed).  However, I increased my contribution, told them about it, have an email from them stating it was increased and would take effect on my 11/15 check.  It did not.  I spoke to the head of HR and she's looking into it but I've heard nothing for several days.  At this point I'm concerned they are going to continue to screw this up and I'm not going to be able to max out my 401k for the year which will have serious tax ramifications for me.

Is there a legal body I could reach out to about this (like CA labor dept or IRS) if they don't fix this or am I at their mercy?

Here's my question I guess, she has a loan for 30,000 that she has been paid on time.. While she has an active loan is she allowed to also make a withdrawal? The loan + the amount she'd be taking out is far less than 50% of the account value if that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

I could not find a clear answer.

Thank you very much in advance.",0,1637116864,105,588
HSA Health Plans vs better PPO plans,"I know HSA’s are great if your employer offers them.

Need some help with PPO vs HDHP,"Hey guys, I am finally getting around to looking at my health plans. Just to give some background I do have a 9 year old daughter, I am also 31 so fairly young.  


Here are my two options:  


|PPO|HDHP (w/ HSA)|
|:-|:-|
|**Deductible** \-- Individual: $1,500 Family: $3,000 |**Deductible --** Individual: $3,000 Family: $6,000  |
|**Out of Pocket MAX** \-- Individual: $4,000 Family: $8,000 |**Out of Pocket MAX** \--  Individual: $6,000 Family: $12,000|
|**CO-INSURANCE** \-- 20% |**CO-INSURANCE** \-- 30% |
||**HSA** \-- $1000 a year employer contribution with child. $6300 a year plan annual maximum employee contribution|

&amp;#x200B;

I am fairly new to how HSA's work and how HDHP work in general. I do occasionally go to the chiropractor and we do our yearly physicals. We've maybe in 9 years been to the hospital 3 times cause my daughter broke her arm. However, looking forward I don't foresee any major medical expenses and on average spend maybe $500 a year on medical related expenses since we're so young. I do also take Crestor, a generic cholesterol medication, so I'm not sure if that would affect the above.  


Anyone have any advice if HDHP is better vs a PPO? I've noticed a lot of people stating it's a good retirement vehicle being triple tax advantage. Currently I'm on the PPO, but thinking of switching. I do plan to max out that $6300 if I go with HDHP/HSA.",0,1637116493,234,1386
"Asked on different subreddit, but looking for basic budget advice","First off, I know the importance of needing to invest for retirement and a variety of plans which I will eventually do. Right now I'm focused on actually getting started in life. I'm mid 20s and just started my first full-time career after finishing college making $52,971 a year before taxes. Additionally I have a part-time job where I expect to earn an extra $5,000 annually

So with $57,971, I ran a few IRS and other tax calculators and my post-tax pay should be roughly $44,000. This includes factoring in the 2022 standard deductions, HSA deduction, student interest deduction, and a few other ones that I qualify for. Additionally this includes other work-related pre-tax retirement plans 

I've looked at the 50/30/20 rule and so far have sort of broken down possible monthly budget as follow:

Rent: $1,100 (water included)

Car Payment: $267

Groceries: $250

Student Loan: $189

Utilities: $100

Phone &amp; Internet: $100 

Car &amp; Renter's Insurance: $75

Total: $2,081 

Annual total: $24,972

&amp;#x200B;

Subtracting from my take-home pay then that leaves me with $19,028 or about $790 every 2 weeks to spend and save on whatever else I need.

Alternatively I can wait to move out on my own a few months and use the money for rent to instead pay down student loans. I currently have $20,000 in my savings and could use $5,000+$6,600 to pay my student loans to being only $73 a month 

If that then I would be spending $23,580 at most in a year with $850 every 2 weeks, meaning an extra $60

Or I can direct the $11,600 to my auto loan instead, leaving me with a payment of $78 a month with yearly spending dropping to $22,704 and leaving me with $887 every 2 weeks for discretionary spending/saving 

I feel like essentially having $1,600 a month to spend as I choose isn't that bad as I don't have much free time and spend most time doing work",0,1637116278,313,1864

"Questions about saving, retirement planning, and minimizing AGI for PSLF","I recently finished graduate school and will be starting my first grown-up job next month, which comes with a large pay increase. Navigating the allocation of savings vs retirement planning has my head spinning a bit. On top of this, I will be eligible for PSLF - because I will be on an income driven repayment (IDR) plan for my student loans, I feel highly motivated to minimize my AGI to keep my student loan payments lower. 

Here is some info:

* Salaried at $108k/year working 30 hours a week, will likely be able to pick up additional shifts for extra $$$
* $8k sign on bonus which I will receive next month
* Spouse is hourly, making approximately $70k/year
* \~$15k in savings currently
* Student loans: Payments will be \~$450 the first year, \~$180 the second year, and third year payments will be based off of my 2022 AGI
* Debt: $600/month car payment on one vehicle (will be paid off 2/2024), $10k in credit card debt on 0% interest card (will be paying $500 a month on this over the next 24 months)
* Other expenses: Rent @ $1700/month which includes all utilities (VHCOL area so this is a great deal for us), parking \~$150/month, insurance for both vehicles and home \~$175/month, health insurance premium for my spouse and I \~$200/month
* Because I am on an IDR plan, planning to file taxes MFS as this will minimize my payments greatly
* No kids, but are considering trying in \~2 years. 

Retirement plan options:

* 403b with 5% match, match increases to 7.5% in 5 years
* 457b DCP (deferred compensation plan)
* Given that my spouse and I will be MFS, my understanding is that neither of us can contribute to an IRA without significant tax penalties. 

Additional ways to minimize AGI:

* FSA

So, with all of that information, here are my considerations. Spouse and I are going back and forth about buying a house vs renting for the next few years. Like I said, we're in a VHCOL area and given the state of the housing market, buying here is a nightmare. We also don't know exactly where we want to be so renting feels more comfortable at the moment. Overall, our general considerations are putting money aside to save for a down payment on a house vs maxing out my retirement accounts to minimize my AGI, save on my student loan payments and get a jump on our future. 

How would you go about this? Should I max out all of my retirement accounts and FSA? Should I max out my 403b and skip the 457b? Should I just get my match via 403b and then max out 457b? My understanding is that withdrawing from 457b can be done earlier without the same tax penalties, and I am considering early retirement as a possibility. Should we be more conservative with retirement and  just get my 401k match and start saving more aggressively for a down payment? Any help would be appreciated here.",0,1637114541,496,2803

Roth IRA for 22% fed tax bracket,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice or thoughts on my retirement situation. I started maxing out my 401k at work a few years ago. This year, I recently switched jobs and will not be offered 401k participation for 3 months. This means that I will not be able to max out my 401k this year. 

I have a few options to make up for this, but let me know if I am missing anything.

1) do a back door Roth even though I am currently in the 24% bracket (even with all deductions). I can easily max this out and not miss the money.  I am behind on my retirement contributions because I took the long route in school. Doing more Roth will allow me to diversify buckets in retirement even if my tax rate stays the same. 

2) open a solo401k for the side gig income that I make doing Rover. I expect to have made about $2000 net this year (1099 income). 

3) just save up more money towards my down payment (very HCOL) area. We are aggressively saving to attain a 20% down payment.

FA missed updating one beneficiary form for my deceased mother -- any advice?,"My sister and I are getting my late mother's estate together. Prior to my mom's passing, I confirmed with my mom's financial advisor that her beneficiaries were in order. My mother had previously allocated some things to my sister's kids but decided, in the end, to split everything 50/50 between my sister and I. My mom had misgivings about willing things directly to her grandchildren (it's a long story).

The FA, who works at a large, well-known wealth management company, assured me that it was 50/50 between my sister and I. Then, my sister/my mom/me had a meeting with the FA had a meeting last June, just to make sure we had everything covered with the estate planning. Again, the FA assured us that everything was 50/50.

Now that we are handling my mother's estate, we have found that on a large account, the beneficiary designations are in fact outdated and still list my sister's kids. Which is not what my mom wanted. The Financial Advisor claims that they do not recall the 50/50 conversation this summer and has no notes indicating that my mother's 50/50 request was what was decided.

HSA reimbursements for previous years,"I recently learned that you can delay using your HSA to reimburse yourself for eligible health expenses to maximize investment growth.

PayPal debited my account because I got a “Duplicate Refund”,"  I purchased something from Purple with Citi Mastercard linked to PayPal back in June. Returned the items but did not receive a refund. So, I dispute this with Citibank. After the dispute, Purple refunded me (Think they were just very slow), so I canceled my dispute with Citibank because I already got my refund.

Two days ago, PayPal email me and said that my account balance was debited because there was a ""Duplicate refund"". I called and they told me when I open the dispute with Citibank, Citibank requested a refund from PayPal. However, because I canceled the dispute, I never actually received a refund from Citibank (They did credit my account but that was taken back because I canceled the dispute). I call PayPal and they told me that because they're not a bank, they cannot dispute this, so they just decide to take money out of my account. Now I'm screwed because I know PayPal won’t help me. Citibank told me they cannot start a new dispute because there was already one (That was canceled).

Fast forward, one rep from Citibank actually understood my problem, she somehow started a new dispute for me for that transaction. However, I call in again, they told me usually this isn't allowed, and my case probably will be denied. The rep that helped me did not leave any notes (I’m sad now because I think no one will actually understand my problem). The rep from Citibank that helped me also said that they’ve already returned the money to PayPal. I know I will probably not be able to obtain proof for that and PayPal will not just listen to me saying this.

is it worth it to go broke to pay off debt?,"Hey,

I'm 23 and have about 40k of debt in student loans. Being the age I am, I am very gungho on leaving my moms place and finding my own place. I make $55k before tax for salary and take home pay monthly is $3.1k (this is due to me signing up for health insurance with the company I am with. Without it I'd be pulling in about $3.3k). On top of the monthly take home pay, I make money from music thru Spotify and other streaming services which brings in about $110ish a month. 

I'd like to move out but trying to follow the general rent should be 30ish percent of income, I can only get places that are not in the location I would want to live in.

However, my mother offered me the whole downstairs of an apartment for only about 450 a month. If I were to take that, I'd only spend about 23% of my monthly income which would leave me with about 2.5k a month after rent and other expenses. I could use all that for loans.

With that, I have 18k in my checkings account. I don't have a savings account.

The buyer made the payment through Paypal and the fund was transferred to my account. As soon as it became available to withdraw, I pulled it and deposited to my bank. Here is where that buyer became a scammer.

The scammer filed a dispute on Ebay demanding a refund of the DIGITAL KEY which he now has full control of (god knows if he redeemed it or not). I provided proofs that my listing clearly said not refundable. Ebay took this into consideration and I won the case.

A few days later, this scammer opens a case on paypal and I go through the same thing.  But for some reason, even with the same proof and the fact that Ebay accepted my defense, paypal leaned on the scammer’s side and my account was forcefully closed.

I thought it ended there with me losing my account, but 4 years later, I get this letter from a company called “CREDIT CORP SOLUTIONS INC” saying that I owe paypal $30 NON ATO REVERSAL and $60 charge back for not having seller protection.

I immediately called the number on the letter, told the agent what I could, but they still want to collect the money otherwise “it will affect your credit score”.

What do I do at this point? Do I just pay them $90 and get on with my life or fight back? My credit score is around 790-810 and I honestly don’t want to see it being affected by unjust $90 debt….",0,1637112975,262,1396

"Pay off one car loan, buy cash or finance at low rate","I am purchasing a new vehicle at the end of this month.   Car total will be $42,372 after tax.  The finance special on this is 1.9% for 60 months or 2.9% for 72 mo and I am sure I will qualify (750+ credit score).   The question I have been debating is whether I should pay off my current auto loan or put just a 20% on this new car and use the rest of my savings to pay the car loan.   

For financial context, we currently have $30k total in two different HY checking accounts earning 3% annually.  My current car loan has a balance of $11k on the loan at 4.9% that has a payment of $226/mo.   My wife and I are currently making good money (190k combined) however she will be taking time off to help take care of our newborn.   She will only get 3 weeks of maternal leave and it is our first child so not sure what to expect.  We do not want to put her into daycare with the pandemic going on. 

If I put 20% down on the new car, I will have a payment of  $593.  With a balance of 20k, I will have approximately 33 months of payments saved up.  Ideally, my wife will be back in the workplace in a year's time and we will have our daughter's babysitting issue sorted out.

The other scenario is if I were to pay off the current car loan, dip a little into our emergency fund as well (5k out of 8k saved), take the 2.9% APR for 72 months offer, I would have a car payment of $278 which would be just a little more than what I currently pay.  This scenario would leave our emergency fund a little depleted however I would be able to recoup it in about 2 months.

My hesitation of just not buying this new car with cash outright is just the uncertainty of the economic future especially with the huge rise in inflation.",0,1637112822,352,1717

Holiday gift reimbursed by company or bonus taxed at 22%?,"HR asked people managers at my company if we'd prefer to have our reports purchase their gifts and then be reimbursed 2 weeks later, or if we'd prefer they receive a bonus taxed at 22%. 

The gift can be whatever they want - groceries, new shoes, whatever. I haven't heard the amount yet, but this could be $500 vs. $390.

I thought the obvious answer was reimbursement, but I've become the pariah. When I said more money would be more impactful someone implied I was speaking from  privilege.

Planning insurance for newborn,"I'm due with our first baby in February.  I will be added to my husband's insurance as of January 1st since I'm leaving my job sometime in January.

(I have prior HSA funds that I can use if needed for this)  
I was then considering if it would be worth it to pay for a more expensive plan (with what seems to be a free birth) for the beginning of the year and then switch to the cheaper plan during the qualifying life event after the baby is born. (Both are bcbs plans so same doctors in network just different tiers)   I dont want to pay the premiums on the more expensive plan for the whole year (the difference would be more than $1500) but I'm wondering if this would work out to save on the facilty fee.

Turning 26 and in college health insurance. What are affordable options?,"I was just accepted into an RN nursing program at a community college and I’m ecstatic to start. At the moment I am a 25 year old male living in New York and my graduation date is my 28th birthday (about 26 months)

I’m going to be kicked off of my parents health insurance while I’m in school and turn 26. I was wondering what the most cost effective solution would be to get cheap healthcare that would cover my medication and checkups without hurting my academics.

I currently work per-diem in a hospital but there are no part time positions that are open and accessible to my schedule so transitioning to a benefits providing position is an uncertain long term goal. I’m currently investigating working remote for another company to get benefits.

I am trying to avoid getting a new job that would require training or a large commitment as I’m putting my education first. 

Financially I have a very nice emergency fund and my entire nursing programs tuition in two separate accounts. My end goal is to make it to the end of the program without having to touch the emergency fund

So far the things I’ve considered are
1) Affordable care marketplace
2) taking insurance through the college but I’m only taking 9 credits per semester 
3) seeing if I’m eligible for Medicaid or something to that effect and quitting my job to stay in the threshold
4) Try to juggle a remote job and school, but my biggest fear is getting removed from the program

Just got out of a bad car lease. Thought I'd help someone else in my situation.,I leased a 2020 Nissan Rogue Sport and had negative equity added into the lease and bad credit so my payment ended up being $650/month for 36 months. It was a stupid mistake. I needed a reliable car for my son that was coming and I freaked out and made a mistake. Well 11 months later I was able to get out of the lease and just had to pay 1k which was the difference for the payoff. Now I have a nice reliable 2013 Honda pilot touring edition which I financed for $300 a month. Which I will pay off in about 15 months. I tried selling my Nissan at CarMax but they don't accept leases anymore so I was stuck with it but I gave it a shot and asked Nissan if they are interested in buying my leased car back and they were. Now I'll be having an extra $400 a month to work with which I'll be putting in a separate savings just for car repairs or to replace this car when the time comes. Thought I'd share.

Travel insurance just paid me a lot more than what I had claimed due to currency conversion error,"So I filed a travel claim for expenses accrued as my flight from Lebanon was delayed for 4 days by the airline.

Company dumps all its 401(k) contributions at end of year. Is it worth pre-loading a 401(k) as it wouldn't miss out on matching?,"Hello all,

Part of the compensation at my wife's new job is a 15% contribution of her base + bonus into her 401(k).  This is *not* a match, and doesn't require that she contribute anything.  It also is not deposited paycheck by paycheck, but is given in one lump sum in mid-January after the year in question (e.g., in January 2022 she gets her 15% from all 2021 income).

I get that this is not ideal for the the first year, as it essentially delays time in the market, although I guess it evens out moving forward.  However, does this affect how my wife should time her 401(k) contributions moving forward (e.g., does it mean that is is best to just max out my wife's 401(k) in January every year)?  

I was wondering if we could simply use her year-end bonus to front-load the 401(k) and then forget about it for the rest of the year, and kind of make-up for the delay in getting the company's 401(k) contribution.

I learned the power of the CFPB,"TLDR; After almost a full year of trying to get my money from closing an account with my credit union, I finally received it today because I filed a complaint with the CFPB. 

In February of this year, I closed an account with my credit union because I hadn't made any transactions with them in years due to having no locations in the area I moved to. The initial interaction with staff was pleasant. They were able to close my account and they assured me a check would arrive within 2 weeks to the new address I provided to them. I waited the 2 weeks and nothing came in the mail. I called back the credit union and the representative was apologetic and said to wait just a bit longer and call back if nothing changed. She gave me the check number and told me to keep an eye out for it. But, if I wanted them to send me a new check, I could fill out their forms and cancel the original. 

I took a look at the forms and there were two issues I had. 1. They required it to be notarized, which would cost ME time and money for an issue that wasn't my fault. 2. It was an indemnity form. So, if for any reason the original check got cashed, even after putting a stop on it, the responsible party to pay would be ME. Again, for something that wasn't my fault. I refused to sign it. 

I waited the 3 months for the check to be invalid on it's own, and no one had cashed it. It was lost in the mail. I called back the credit union AGAIN and spoke with someone new. She, again, was very apologetic and assured me she would issue a new check and it would arrive in \~2 weeks. No need to sign the forms to stop the check, because so much time had passed. 

""Great!"" I thought. I hung up and waited 2 more weeks. And no check arrived. I decided to wait another 3 months so the check would expire on it's own again so that I wouldn't need to go through that whole process of arguing against signing that indemnity form. 

3 months go by, no check. Once again I called the credit union and spoke with yet another representative. She informed me that no check was ever re-cut or re-sent 3 months ago, the previous rep had lied to me. This new rep said that because I never signed the indemnity form, they couldn't re-cut a new check. I asked to speak to a manager, because at this point I was angry and felt like the bank was jerking me around. She refused to let me speak to a manager and insisted she could handle it. She kept talking over me and was rushing to get me off the phone. Eventually, she said that they would waive any fee associated with getting a new form signed and that a new form would be sent for me to fill out. I was frustrated and agreed and hung up.

The form she sent me was THE SAME FORM from before (she gave me the impression it would be something different). I was furious at this point and went to my husband to rant. He was able to calm me down and insisted I report this issue to the CFPB. So, I did. After, I sent an email to the newest rep stating my disappointment. I stated that she refused to let me speak to a manager, refused to listen to my plight,  and she wanted me to repeat steps I had already taken; I told her that I reported the issue to the CFPB. She responded within the hour stating that she never said I couldn't speak to the manager, basically called me a liar, and was over-all nasty. We sent a few emails back and forth and neither of us budged. I left it as is and waited for a response from the CFPB. 

They were saints. They didn't cover closed account issues, but opened a new case for me with the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), who in turn also didn't deal with those issues, who then forwarded it along to the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. From the time I submitted that request, to today (about 2 weeks), I finally got my money. The credit union sent a FedEx priority mailed check, with a letter of apology AND 8% interest for the 11 months I was without my money. I wish I summitted that issue a long time ago. 

I'm relieved to have my money and can put this all behind me. But, a few tips for anyone in my shoes:

Transfer as much money out of your account that is allowed (if there are minimums to keep it open) and THEN close the account, once you have the money cleared in your other account. 

Make frequent calls. Don't assume the representatives actually followed through on their actions, follow-up frequently yourself. 

Contact the CFPB if they refuse to work with you. I can't stress this enough, I'm confident this is why my money was returned to me so quickly after I submitted that issue.

Best of luck to you all, and thanks for listening.",0,1637106162,888,4633

Living above my means; any way to get back on track?,"Hi guys. I'm 23, male, and live with my parents near West Houston, TX. I have a bi-weekly take-home pay of $1,800 and average monthly spending of $3,000. As part of an agreement made with my parents to avoid paying them to rent, half of my incoming paychecks are automatically moved into high-yield savings at 0.5% APR.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the main deal is that I use credit a lot. I have 4 credit cards with a combined limit of $14,785 and a limit of $8,000 on the primary card. The primary card is with Chase and supports Equal Pay Financing for most purchases. Anything over $50 I can pay for over 6 months, $100 12 months, $150 18 months, $500 24 months at 0% APR. I have autopay configured for 'Interest-saving balance' where it'll automatically keep track of any financing I qualify for and pay the minimum needed to avoid interest. The purchase and balance transfer APRs were set to 4.99% yesterday as a loyalty reward. I've been spending more than I make for 4 years, have never missed a payment, and never paid interest. I suppose my question is if this is sustainable or if I should rein my spending in?

Does backdoor Roth make sense to do?!,"M (29)
-2021 Income gross income: 152k
-Traditional IRA balance of 18k. 12k of post tax contributions, 6k in interest returns. No pre tax contributions in this account or any other IRA accounts. I have no other IRA accounts.
-No contributions to IRA for 2021 yet (Roth or Traditional)
-I do have an employer 401k. 52k in 401k from my employer 401k. Employer does not match. 

Question 1. I want to contribute 6k for 2021 to my Traditional IRA and then do a backdoor Roth. My understanding is I can but the 18k in there today + my 6k would be counted as additional income for my income (maybe not since the contributions are post tax and I am not looking to use the contributions as tax deductions?)

Question 2. Also, my understanding is I would also owe taxes on the returns of the 12k post tax contributions. Is that correct?

I am building a new budgeting app,"I want to build something new. (There is a shortage of budget apps out there...right?!?) I have used a lot of great tools to create budgets. But I haven't found one that hits everything I want.

My issues with existing tools:

1. Consequences of overspending are ambiguous...until... you come short on a bill, can't go out with friends some night, or realize you won't be able to go on that vacation when you wanted.
2. Recovery from overspend is an after thought. Ok so I went over my budget for eating out this month....where does that money come from? Medium/long term saving? Cutting back at the grocery store? Pretend that it didn't happen and hope to do better next month?!
3. Unplanned potential purchases are difficult. Oh! There is an awesome Black Friday deal on this gadget I have been wanting. Can I make this work?? Well, to find out takes more work than it should. Either I think through it mentally (I am bound to underestimate the effects), or I have to modify the whole budget to model what it would look like which is not very fun (which is why I often overspend choosing the former).
4. Virtual accounts are too frictionless. Gas fills the volume of the container its in...well, spending fills the balance of checking account it's in. Envelopes, goals, budget categories etc. They are too easy to pop the bubble.  Creating multiple accounts to add a little friction helps, but budgeting apps only let me track those accounts, not leverage and account for the added friction. This mitigates the impact of modularizing accounts and leaves me open to overdrawing.
5. Crypto. Money is changing. I want native support for budgeting my crypto savings and spending. I haven't seen this in existing products.
6. Apple Card. I am a big fan of my Apple Card....but it is terrible when it comes to integrating with budgeting apps.

I am an iOS developer so I am going to build a new app to address these issues. At the very least I want it to just help me stick to a budget. But if the above problems resonate with you...maybe I can help you too. I would love your input so I can build my MVP (minimum viable product) which I am currently calling Modular Money. I have created a Twitter account ([@modular_money](https://twitter.com/modular_money)) so you can follow along with future updates. Here is my vision for this new app so far:

1. A budget is created by adding multiple bank accounts that can be tracked and assigned jobs. A job is linked to one or more goals or budget categories which are assigned an amount ($, BTC, ETH, etc) and a priority.  Priorities can range from Untouchable (rent, utilities, etc) -&gt; Totally Unecessary (massage, that 10th streaming service, etc), and everything in between.
2. Transactions are imported either automatically or manually. Each transaction must be manually reviewed to assign to the correct categor(y|ies). But this categorization will be facilitated via auto populating fields using contextual (which account/card did the spending? what is the name of the merchant?) and historical information (how did you categorize this merchant previously?). Manually setting categories not only ensures they are accurate, but also helps you keep a pulse on your budget. Un-categorized transactions will be prominently displayed to indicate the budget is not up-to-date.
3. Overspend. When overspend occurs, the app will suggest recovery plans using the priorities previously set. For instance, if I am off track to go over on restaurant spending for the week/month, the app might suggest to suspend Netflix for the next few months. Or perhaps suggest that you take your planned vacation a little later. The app will work its way up your priory list until you have built a plan the makes up for the over spend.
4. Hypotheticals. Want to buy that new gadget but you didn't plan for it? Leverage the recovery plan pro-actively. Input a hypothetical purchase and let the app suggest a plan the will help you modify your budget. At the end you can either discard (the app successfully talked you out of it!) or apply the plan officially to your budget.
5. Future forecasting. Using separate accounts helps keep finances in check, but it can also lead to overdrawing the account  if not thought through properly. The app will use your budget, current spending pace, and upcoming bills, to warn you about accounts running low. For instance, if you  splurge on a fancy meal from Checking Account A  on the 3rd of the month and your Electric bill auto drafts and the 13th, and you forget to transfer some money, the app will warn you to make a transfer according to your recovery plan so that you don't overdraw the account or miss the bill.
6. Settle up. If you have multiple bank accounts with different jobs, sometimes life gets in the way and its not convenient to use the correct debit/credit card. Maybe your partner's credit card is responsible for groceries and yours for shopping, but this month you go to the grocery store and they go pick up new socks....The app will keep track of all these out-of-place expenditures and give you the most condensed way to transfer the money back into the right accounts.
7. Crypto. Crypto wallets and transactions should be first class citizens. I am still learning what this means myself. But for now I would like to track and spend coins like BTC and ETH just like the rest of my USD accounts.
8. Apple Card. Importing Apple Card transactions isn't simple. There are no integrations for it and Apple only provides CSV or Quicken files for prior month's statements. That makes it hard to keep up with the current month. This app would use text recognition and the iOS sharing API to \*easily\*  import screenshots of transactions from the Wallet app into Modular Money.
9. Deep iOS integration. No login, no custom server, all data will be kept on device and in iCloud, home screen widgets, spotlight integration, Siri Shortcuts, share sheets, Mac app, Apple Watch complications, etc.....eventually I want it all. The app should feel like an extension of the Apple Ecosystem.

If this post resonates with you, I would love additional feedback and ideas. I will do my best to build in the open and keep everyone up to date. And as soon as I have something shippable I'd be happy to welcome y'all to participate in betas. For updates, follow along [@modular_money](https://twitter.com/modular_money)",0,1637102397,1078,6386
How to consolidate accounts and cards without F-ing up our credit.,"Wife and I both have accounts (personal and a joint checking) with HSBC, which as you may know is shutting down its retail banking and rolling customers over to Citizens Bank. We don’t have any Citizens locations near us, so we’re pulling out of HSBC altogether and finally combining our finances. We both have our own credit cards with HSBC and my wife has a Chase card with very good rewards. 

Today we opened joint savings and checking accounts with Ally. My wife added me as an authorized user on her Chase card, but it’s still her line of credit. I’m not really sure how to navigate shutting down the HSBC accounts without messing up our credit. If I close my HSBC CC, I wont have any CC that’s in my name. I have 15+ years of history on that card. We’ve never missed a mortgage or CC payment and both have credit scores in the 700s and 800s depending on reporting agency.

"Phone number stolen, accounts hacked, money stolen - any advice?","I don’t know if this is the correct subreddit for this. Let me know if there’s a better place to post this. 

My phone number was stolen via transfer fraud. They got into on me and used it to transfer my phone number to another carrier. Once they had my number, they used it to access my Coinbase account where they bought $750 in Bitcoin and sent it to themselves. 

I caught it quickly - within an hour - and my bank quickly canceled my debit card in hopes that it would stop the transaction, but it didn’t. 

I filed a fraud claim with my bank, Charles Schwab, and Coinbase comes back claiming that all signs point to it being me who initiated the transaction. So I’m apparently gonna be out $750. 

Coinbase is telling me that this is my fault and not being very responsive. Schwab is being friendly, but is saying I need better evidence. My phone provider isn’t any help at all, besides stating over the phone “yes, your number was ported on X date.” 

Seems like this was a perfect crime and there isn’t much I can do. Any ideas on steps I can take to try to either provide proof to Schwab that my money was stolen, or anything to get my money back?

"Fraudulent Wire Fraud of 60k Chase Bank. Chase deems ""wire recall unsuccessful,"" what are my options?","I apologize in advanced for any grammatical errors. I'm in a very emotional state and would love your help. Quick backstory, my parents had a bank account for me for when I was younger and I still use it to this day. Because they made it, they still have access and can see into my account.

A few weeks ago (10/26/21), I was told by my dad that a 60,000 wire transfer from my account (Account 1) was made to a woman in Florida(who I do not know, but all the information is on the receipt) and asked if I had done this. I had not, immediately called Chase that day (10/21/21) to freeze the accounts. It was after hours at that point, so I was not able to reach Fraud Claims and could not stop the pending charge. Later that evening, I saw a 20,000 transfer into my account from another checking account (account 2) that my parents oversee (of which, I do not have access), which they also did not initiate. That morning when the Fraud Department opened up, I called Chase and also filed a police report to get the investigation going on the fraud going. I also called Wells Fargo, but they were not helpful at all and told me to just file through Chase.

Later, that morning, when my local bank opened I came in to fill out some paperwork to submit for the claim. The teller tells me that there was another 20,000 transfer (from account 2) that morning and an attempt to wire another $30,000 (from account 1) to the Florida recipient, but was blocked because of the frozen account. I submitted the paperwork with my side of the story that they needed that day. A week later ask to fill out a affidavit, submit the police report and have a notary seal it. Parents and I have changed all their accounts. I call Chase every few days over the next few weeks and found out today (11/16)from the rep that they attempted a recall of the wire transfer and was unsuccessful on 11/10. No notice or anything. I did not receive a temporary credit or anything. The claim was made on 10/26/21 and today is 11/16/21. I have not received a formal letter saying that my claim is denied yet. I am just in shock and want to move quickly. Am I shit out of luck? What are my options? I have never wired anything out of this account and am surprised that such a large amount was wired so easily. Should I file with CFPB?

**TLDR:** Fraudulent wire transfer of 60k on 10/26/21 from Chase to Wells Fargo, other suspicious activity also ongoing. Filed claim through Chase, filed police report, submitted paperwork, affidavit, notary seal. Three weeks later (11/16/21), no official letter, but was told by Chase after calling them over the phone that wire transfer recall was unsuccessful and will probably not be in my favor.

Accurate way of calculating withholding for 1099 contractors?,"Hi, I’m really new to being a 1099 contractor. I’ve found a few “rough estimate” calculators online that give you a vague idea of how much I should set saving for taxes, but nothing that can give me exact amounts. 

Is there some utility (website, app, program, etc) that can factor in whatever relevant information they use at tax time to determine precisely the amount (within a few dollars) that I should be putting aside each paycheck, so I don’t freak out come tax season? 

I’ve already created a savings account for this express purpose. I know that if I see it in my checking account, I may be more likely to overspend, but by putting it into a separate account it will be easier to manage my money.

Best Personal Finance/Budgeting App for the Accumulation Phase?,"As I'm sure some of you know, YNAB recently doubled their price for legacy users.

So far Quicken and Monarch money seem like the prime contenders to me, but Quicken has a steep learning curve and weird cross platform differences, and Monarch has a few hiccups with managing non-investment savings between months. Not terribly concerned about cost if it can manage those things well.

My question is, am I better off trading it in, paying off the rest of the loan first, or fix it? I don't want to get into another car loan but if it's a newer more reliable car, I'd be willing to do payments again, especially since I know more now than I did then.",0,1637098674,144,699
Financial Literacy Research,"Hello all, I hope some of you will be able to help me out as I've searched high and low and haven't really been able to find what I'm looking for. I'm hoping you fine folks will be able to sort me out. I'm looking for any academic research that deals with adolescents and financial literacy. Specifically, I need insights into a variety of questions such as, but not limited to: 

1- How financially literate/educated are teens today? And their parents? Is financial literacy increasing or decreasing over time? Is it socio-economically driven?
2- What are the long term (adult) outcomes of financial literacy education in adolescence?
3- Are there better or worse ways of teaching financial literacy to teens?
4- What are adolescents' spending/money habits?

Specific questions on kiddie tax and 1040,"&gt; In 2021, unearned income under $1,100 qualifies for the standard deduction.

Purchasing first home/weighing options,"Currently contemplating purchasing my first home and weighing a few different options that I’d like some input on.

Some background context about me:
- Am single 28F
- Currently renting in Atlanta, Ga. My lease ends 1/31/22
- Currently employed in a very secure org; I do not expect my employment status to change in the near term. My current salary is $75k annually. I will be promoted to a senior role on 1/1 with a bump to $95k. I also have an annual guaranteed performance bonus w/ a minimum 10% payout; based on my desk’s performance the past calendar year, I believe this will be closer to 12-13%. The bonus will not pay out until 3/31/22
- Currently have ~$90k saved for purchase/down payment 

I was previously planning to relocate to a smaller city (Asheville/Chattanooga ideally) with a lower COL once my lease ends. However, I LOVE the current home and neighborhood where I am renting now. The home belongs to a very close family friend, and after discussing they offered to sell the property if I was interested. The property itself has been great but is far and away out of my budget. The deal we verbally discussed was:

- Selling price: $700k (estimates online put it at $750-775)
- $50k down payment 
- 5yrs owner financing until I have enough equity for a conventional mortgage @ 0% interest. Would have to option to still sell at any time if I decide I want to leave.

Obviously I would get an inspection + hire an attorney to draft a formal purchase agreement. My alternative purchase if I were to relocate would be:

- $250-315k selling price
- 20% down payment 
- Could very likely be approved through my local CU for a 30yr fixed @ 3.27% apr 

Hoping to get opinions on these options. My gut tells me go with the family friends home. When I run the numbers for my monthly expenses, I can swing the payments+tax and have enough to cover my personal expenses/debts and contribute to retirement/savings/investments. It would definitely eat up a significantly larger amount of my income, but I feel like it would A.) be significantly nicer than many of the other properties I’ve looked at in my price range and B.) appreciate significantly more in value over time based on the location.

Building credit for someone with no credit history - thoughts on subscribing to financial apps (Portify and LOQBOX in particular) over opening first credit building credit card account,"So I've never opened a credit card before but I'm looking for rewards on travel and cashback. I have a low credit rating (490) as I've been abroad for five years and have never borrowed money (except for UK student loans)

I'm looking at online credit cards at the moment, and it's being suggested that I get a credit building card due to my low credit score. But I'll probably want to shut this down as soon as I can since it doesn't give me any cashback or travel rewards in return and it's an extra hassle having a card that I would need to maintain in order to keep up any minimum usage. The problem with closing it would be that I could lower my credit score more significantly and it takes some time to improve your credit score after closing a credit card account (apparently??). Ideally, I would just open two accounts - one with cashback rewards and another with travel rewards (Axios points for example) but when I look at the predictability calculators I'm told that I'm very unlikely to get accepted. I've started to look for alternatives and have found two credit building apps called Portify and LOQBOX, which claim to build credit. If I stuck with them for the year then I suppose in theory my credit rating would improve enough to open a cashback credit card account and travel rewards credit card account

What are your thoughts on these? Will these build a good amount of credit compared with taking out a credit building credit card? Is it so bad to close a credit building card once I'm done with the 'perk' of it building my credit score? Maybe there are better ways to build credit for someone like me that I just don't know about",0,1637095898,300,1652

Need help identifying math error - year-to-year effect of 2% Cost of Living Adjustment,"Hi there,

I suspect a math error may have been made by our finance department and that the cumulative effects of 2% COLA increase are being over-represented year-to-year.

It could be the case that I'm mistaken; I'm not sure. I appreciate any help :)  thanks!

How much should I expect to get for a 2021 tax refund?,"I won't go into details, but 2021 is the first year in my adult life (48yo) that I have made any kind of decent money. Given that I have been getting a LOT of taxes taken out, I've been expecting a decent-sized refund for 2021. I've used some tax calculators I've found online, and most say that I should only expect maybe $2000-$2500usd back. Where the hell did all my money go?!

As of my last paycheck, I've grossed $76,763, so I'll probably have made $80,000 by year's end. My YTD taxes so far (Federal, Medicare, Social Security, State W/H, State disability) come to $21,025. I have also been contributing 10% of my gross into a 403b, if that counts for anything.

any thoughts would be appreciated.",0,1637094970,125,704

I currently make--

Despite taking on large amounts of responsibility, i don't think i'll be promoted this year at current firm), exposure to a set of clients that is different--albeit not \~dream clients\~ from current role (something I'm looking for), more concrete path for growth (somewhat related to that type cast thing with my current firm). 

I also know that all that really matters is what you gross at the end of the year but something about my base salary being so much lower than the base salary being offered here (despite consistently large bonuses at my current firm) is messing with my head/ maybe seems important?

Help in Managing Between Roth IRA and Brokerage Account,"Hey everyone,

This past year I opened up a Roth IRA and maxed it out for the year due to having quite a bit of money saved up.

I have a cushiony emergency fund, and the remainder of my money is tied into a regular brokerage account in some mutual index funds.

My question is when I am able to start contributing to my Roth IRA again should I be putting my monthly savings directly into the Roth IRA, or should I use what is in my brokerage account to max out the IRA? I'm not sure what is most advantageous tax-wise. In addition, I'm not sure if I should max out the Roth asap or dollar-cost average throughout the year. I have significantly more in my brokerage than I do in my Roth IRA.

Owe $469,000 at 2.5% with 29 years left and paying $300/mo in PMI. Total payments $2608/mo.

## Options

* principal increases by 10k to cover closing costs

30 year to $479,000* at 3.25% drop PMI total payments of $2086/mo.

20 year to $479,000* at 2.99% drop PMI total payments of $2656/mo.

15 year to $479,000* at 2.25% drop PMI total payments of $3169/mo

## Additional Context

Currently have ~210k in equity. As it is, the house is a little small for our family and, as kids get older, we'd be looking to build up or move. A build up would likely mean a cash out refi down the road - maybe as early as 2 years from now. Moving would almost certainly mean selling the house, but could potentially keep it as an investment rental with similar houses renting for ~$2600-$2800/mo right now. If we built up, I'd expect we'd live in the house for 15+ years until the kids were done with high school.Family has ~12k in CC debt. 

All of the options are financially doable but I don't really know what makes the most sense. Take the 30 year refi and use the savings to more aggressively pay down debt and then invest? Take the 20 year and essentially knock off 10 years of the term with nearly identical payments? Take the 15 year and build up equity more quickly and cut the term in half?

It feels like there are more variables than I know how to to reasonably consider. Would love some input from others. Thanks!",0,1637093944,254,1434
Auto Insurance Location Question,"I'm currently active duty and stationed in Florida, however several years before I moved there I had gotten a new car and auto insurance through USAA while in PA (still living with my parents). I just realized I had never updated the auto insurance policy to say I've now been in Florida. I understand updating your location is a big deal and it's bad that I missed that, but I was wondering if it really matters in my case because my permanent address is still with my parents in PA, my car's license and registration is through PA, and my drivers license is also from PA.

That being said, the car does primarily reside in Florida. So my bottom line question is do I need to update the location or do I risk not being covered if something were to happen with my car then?

I'm planning on maxing out my current 401K, but I'm unsure as to where to put my investments towards. I don't really know much about investing, so target date funds appeal to me due to their ease of use and the ability to ""set and forget"".

Today when I signed on to my Venmo app for the first time after a recent update, the sign-in screen forced me to put in my address, SSN, etc. which I thought was annoying but probably because of the new IRS reporting rules, so I didn't think much of it. Then new terms and conditions, yep, OK. And then the next page told me my credit card was coming in the mail.

In no uncertain terms, I had no idea I was signing up for a credit card and had zero intentions of ever signing up for a Venmo credit account. I tried backing out of the sign-in screen and restarting the app several times in a row and was still forced into the same info-collecting screen.

I've already canceled the credit account, but they wouldn't let me actually reverse the request. So my credit report will not only show the inquiry, but opening and then immediately closing the account. My partner and I are planning to buy a house hopefully within the next few months, and I'm stressed to the max over this.

Do I have any standing to get this off my credit report? And is there any possible way to do so quickly? Or do I have to wait for it to first show up on my report before I can dispute? Also, is this not super super super unethical??? Any advice would be very much appreciated.",0,1637092296,244,1291
Does it make financial sense to upgrade to a SFH?,"I currently live in a condo the bay area. My family is interested in expanding to a single family home costing around 1.5M sometime in the next couple of years as we may be adding new members. 

I'm not sure it makes financial sense. Here are some of the numbers:

Condo value I live in is approximately $1M with 250k left on mortgage. 

**Annual income \~250k**

**After tax assets \~$1M**

**Retirement accounts \~$800k**

about 70% of my assets is in the VT equivalent, the rest has a US tech tilt, very little bonds, but basically this is like a 98% equity portfolio

My loan officer has pre-approved me for a \~1.5M SFH purchase with 20% down. The SFH and condo combined mortgages would put me right at the limit of my borrowing capacity per their required debt to income ratio maximums. 

**Some fears:**

The condo might be difficult to rent out I've seen some condos in our complex stay on the market for considerable time as people want SFHs due to the pandemic. If it does go out it might bring in \~2.7k/month. 

Another concern is I lose my job and feel like it would be difficult to find replacement income equal to it. If I lost my job and the stock market tanks, I would be selling stock at bargain prices to stay afloat. 

Also my company's stock could drop reducing annual income substantially. I'd say about 1/3 of my total income is from regular vesting of company's stock. 

A fear is that I get priced out of the market.  I have seen SFHs that I would like to have in recent years appreciate quickly from 1.0 to 1.25 to 1.5M. 

**Considerations:**

As for the condo, I could sell it, but the value has been flat for about 3 years now so it doesn't seem like the right time to sell now. 

**So my choices are**

1) stay in condo and reevaluate in 1-2 years when I really really need a bigger place

2) buy SFH and hold onto condo, attempt to rent it out

3) buy SFH and sell condo

4) not buy a SFH and get a bigger condo which has not appreciated as quickly in the past years

for buying the SFH the loan options are

1) get the maximum loan

2) get a more conservative loan, sell stocks to increase down pay

3) get the maximum loan but rebalance 98% stocks to something more like 60/40 stock/bond portfolio to have a cushion to draw on",0,1637092185,406,2258
"Interested in buying a property (Scotland).

Assessing Life Insurance Needs?,"Hi all, new poster here. I looked over the the life insurance wiki and noticed there wasn't section that addressed riders or convertibility.  Apologies if this was addressed in older posts from over the years. Our perspective changed with the pandemic, especially with wanting to start a family soon. 

  
I am a 30 yr old male with $25k in student loan debt and $5k owed on my car. 

My wife is a 30 yr old female with $50k in student loan debt and owes $15k on her car. 

We both want to get term policies as we plan to have a couple of kids in the next few years.  

We both have a $400k/30 year mortgage for our 3 bedroom 2 bathroom home. We also plan on getting another property for an AirBnB later on too. First, we want to take care of our kids, each other, and manage to pay off the debt we have. 

I make $75k as a Marketing Manager and she makes $100k as a Project Manager. 

We both don't have any major health issues and I was quoted at $70/month for a 30 yr/$1m policy from Pacific Life. She was quoted at $55/month for the same rate. 

We also ran 40 year quotes with Banner Life/Legal &amp; General. I got $120/month and she got $85/month. 

How important is conversion and is it financially prudent to do it at a later point? Are there any riders that we should aim to get in the underwriting? Is it advantageous to get a 40 year policy at all with Banner over a traditional 30 year plan?

VA vs Conventional loan,"Me(29) and my wife (28) are planning on buying our second home. 

Our combined income is around $18k/month right now but I’m expecting a slight drop moving from our HCOL city. 

We have both have maxed our 401k/TSPs for the last few years so we have $250k saved so far. 

We sold our last home in 2018 and invested most of the profits our brokerage account is sitting around $300k. 

I have pre-approvals for both VA (2.5%) and conventional loans (3%). 

We’re looking at a $500k home and have money to close but I’m debating on going 0% down with the VA and doing upgrades immediately. The home in question is in a neighborhood where most home values are already well over $600k so it seems like a good investment with a little sweat equity from us. 

Am I crazy to consider the higher loan rate and putting money down? Just go with the VA?

Paying off debt with savings plan,"Hi everyone I have built up a bit of debt with a high APR.

Easiest way to get a good deal leasing a car,"I know this sub isn't a big fan of leasing so I'm probably starting on the wrong foot but my wife and I have decided that it's right for us for our next vehicle. I'm wondering if there's a way to lease a car that involves a minimal amount of work and also ends in a pretty good deal. We don't need to get the absolute best deal (I recognize that might require more work) but we also don't want to get fleeced.

Are there any online services that are good for that?

(Also, I should mention two other reasons for this. One, we are extremely busy at the moment which is why we are looking to minimize the time we would have to invest. Two, we really don't love dealing with the typical sales people in the car business and the whole ""good cop, bad cop"" crap we've been subjected to at dealerships. If we can lease a car without having to set foot in a dealership other than test drives that would be fantastic!)",0,1637091514,174,909
"Friend's eligibility for Pell grants is being reviewed, and the company, Inceptia, won't accept his tax return.","My friend is in college and receives Pell grants, so when filing his taxes for the last 2 years we reported the Pell Grant as income so that he could take advantage of the education credits.

On his 2019 1040 it didn't split up his income. It just added his income from his W2 from his job and the Pell grant income, and put it all in line 1 on the 1040.

So we're running into an issue with this company, Inceptia, that is verifying his eligibility for the Pell grant for this year, and they aren't approving his eligibility for the Pell grant because they are saying his 2019 tax return doesn't show the Pell grant as separate income. I was looking through his return and on the Wages, Salaries, and Tips Worksheet it splits up the income, but on the 1040 its all added together.

They told him that he would need a signed statement from a tax professional that stated that the Pell grant was reported as income. However he just got back from H&amp;R Block and they said that the couldn't write a statement because they didn't prepare the taxes. We used Turbo Tax, so I'm not sure what to do.

Need advice about investing with Morgan Stanley.,"18m nw $5000

Forgive me for not knowing many details, I would appreciate input on further questions to ask to optimize advice!

My financial plan going forward was to max out a 401k and Roth IRA, and then a basic index fund through Vanguard. Something like the “lazy” portfolio. 

My dad recently offered that I invest under him through Morgan Stanley. He said his investment team usually won’t bat an eye at you if you’re under 100k, but my Dad has more than that and said if I could put together 15k I could invest under him with the company. My Dad has been with this team for 30+ years and retired at 46.

Splitting bills with SO when one out-earns the other. What is fair? Split by income preferred.,"How would you fairly split paychecks when the income difference is quite large? We are a long-term unmarried couple (he did put a ring on it but we are in no rush to tie the knot). Looking to incorporate a fair split come Jan 1, 2022.

Me (165k)

* Yearly pre-tax deductions are: Medical/Dental/Vision for the both of us (3000), 401k (20,500), HSA (5300, my employer contributes 2000), Life Insurance (180)

* Yearly post-tax deduction: IRA (6000)

**Monthly net after above deductions and taxes: 7108**


Him (75k)

* Yearly pre-tax deductions are: 401k (20,500), HSA (7300)

* Yearly post-tax deduction: IRA (6000)

**Monthly net after above deductions and taxes: 2450**

Before anyone asks, he qualifies as a domestic partner on my health insurance, thus, we are considered tax-independent and can each contribute 7300 to an HSA.

Our total net is 7108+2450=9558. 

Doing the math: this would be a 74/26 split. I would send 74% of my check (5260) and he sends 26% of his check (637) to our joint account to cover joint bills/savings for a combined 5897. Our joint monthly bills are under $3500 so this is enough to cover that and have a joint savings/fun fund. 

I think this is the fairest way as we each would get to keep roughly the same amount each month in our individual accounts (1848/1813, respectively) to cover any personal debts (none currently), individual car insurance/payment, individual brokerages, and fun-money.

Is there a best order for retirement investing?,"I work in Information Security and make a decent salary (high enough to disqualify me for IRAs). For the past 7 or so years I've been working for an employer that would contribute 7.5% of my total salary to my 401(k) at the end of the year. I contributed a small portion every pay period (twice a month) simply because I felt like it was the right thing to do. I recently changed employers and similarly, there's no match, but they will contribute about 15% of my salary to my 401(k). I was just wondering a few things:

1. Should I contribute to the traditional 401(k) at all since there's no match?
2. What should I do with the funds from my former 401(k)? Should I roll this over into my new employer-sponsored 401(k) or should I move this into an IRA? If going the IRA route, would I want to roll this into a traditional IRA or a backdoor Roth IRA? Why or why not?
3. My new employer also offers a Roth 401(k). Are there benefits to contributing to the Roth 401(k) as opposed to the traditional 401(k) and would you pursue this route or something else?

Help figuring out grad student stipend taxes!,"Hi all,

I (18M) just finished my high school with an organization that connected me to a Canadian school where I graduated and got my Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD).

The work she does isn't really popping off, due to Covid and me going to college would really be adding a big dent to her account. I don't want to burden her, but I really want to study and make money and help her meet ends, I'm just a bit timid.

I Bonds vs Student Loans,"Have 8K cash to invest, trying to decide whether to put it into I Bonds for a year and then cash out and put it towards debt. 

Student loans at 6.28% but in forbearance until Jan 2022, so any payments now will go directly towards principal and prevent interest recapitalization. The loans are less than a year old, so interest will continue accrue and recapitalize for a few more years during school until we come up with a repayment strategy to pay them down aggressively.

I Bonds are earning 7.12% but I understand that’s only for 6 months, and that cashing out after a year forfeits 3 months interest.

Better to just ignore the I Bonds and lock in the debt pay down before forbearance ends? Or am I leaving money on the table with these insane I Bonds rates right now?

Can I rollover my 401k to Traditional IRA and also do the backdoor Roth hack in the same year?,"I am switching jobs next month and I have about 100K in my 401K. I am thinking of rolling into a traditional IRA.  


So far up until now, I have neither a traditional IRA nor a Roth IRA. Also, currently, I am well past the income limits for either of them.  So this year, for the first time I want to contribute 6K to a traditional IRA and do a Roth IRA conversion.   


My question is, if I do that and then do a 401K to Traditional IRA conversion, what will be the tax implication of that? Also since I am past the income limit for a traditional IRA, Am I allowed to do a 401K to Traditional IRA conversion?",0,1637088973,124,610

Better to buy the cheapest condo/townhome in HCOL or rent?,"Should we buy or rent, if we want a kid soon and likely won't be staying in the place over 5 years?.......

Wife and I are crunching the numbers on houses. Our combined income is currently 320k with 750k saved in non retirement accounts. Our income was actually higher but I gave up RSUs for a startup (much needed mental change. Bored to death and hellish manager and director). On the safe end, we could be making an extra 150-200k within 2-4 years. For now, we aren't 

The main driver for this decision is wanting to get pregnant within the next year. A kid would cost about 2k more a month in our area with daycare included.

We live in a HCOL and the cheapest 3 bedroom condos or townhomes will be about 1,650 sq ft and go for around 4,500 PITI (+ hoa) a month. 20% down is about 200k out of our mostly stock based cash. Property tax is about 1.2%. 

Renting a 3 bedroom is around 3,500 to 4,000 a month. 

Both are easily doable for us but what is better from a FIRE perspective if we don't plan on living there more than 5 years? Ideally I will gain a big boost to savings through stock or I will be making 150-200k more a year when I switch back to a normal tech job.

Is it better to save 1k a month to rent, or to buy a condo for 2-5 years and then move? 

The only other option is moving to a LCOL area to be by family when the baby is young. Large houses would be half the price as the cheapest condos out here.",0,1637088648,278,1424

Accurate Retirement Calculator?,"I've been fairly aggressive (in my opinion) saving for retirement since I graduated college in 2018. I'm 26 and currently make $75k base (+ \~10% bonus), and am with a company that typically gives 10% bonuses and 5% raises annually. I put 12% in my 401k and my employer puts 4%, and I have my percentage set to automatically increase by 1% every January. I also max out my Roth IRA and am trying to set aside some money for a house. Right now I have $55k in my 401k and $35k in my Roth IRA. 

I track my 401k and Roth IRA diligently via a spreadsheet, and do my best at projecting what I will have saved when I get older. According to my spreadsheet, I will have a pretty comfortable amount in my 401k+IRA when I reach 65 (\~$3.5M). My spreadsheet factors in annual raises, bonuses, IRA limits, 401k limits, 401k match limits, annual percentage increase, etc. and uses a pretty conservative APY of 4%. This is great, but the spreadsheet is pretty clunky and cumbersome to update. I feel pretty comfortable that everything is setup correctly but would still like some validation.

So according to my spreadsheet I'm doing pretty well, and I've already built up more retirement savings than my annual salary before the age of 30, which is a good benchmark. However, when I put all of my retirement info into Fidelity's retirement calculator, my score is in the 70's which is not good. There's no way to put any sort of annual raise into their calculations, and their default APY is super conservative.

Planning to take out a cashout refinance and refinance the entire mortgage. Which should I do first ?,"Hello everyone,
I have currently 75K left on a 340K townhouse @ 4.125% APR. So I paid $735 for principle, $265 for interest and $441 for Escrow.

My goal is to take out the most money from the house for investing and get the most favourable interest rate for my refinanced or new mortgage on the same house.
Now, my question is that is it possible to take out a cash out refinance and also refinance the entire mortgage to a lesser rate ? and which should I do first ?

Disputing Fraud On My Credit Report Due to Credit One Bank,"To make a long story short, Credit One opened an account in my name and sent me a card a week after I applied for a Capital One card. I then activated this fraudulent Credit One card because the logo and the card look identical. After I realized the error a week later, I had never used the Credit One card once, never attempted to use it once and I called Credit One and asked them to close it and that I didn't want this and they tricked me into activating it and I wouldn't pay the annual fee. They said they would not remove it and wouldn't even look into it until I sent them a police report. I then filed a police report and then they gave me a fake email address to send that too and then they said someone will call back and of course nobody ever does and they refuse to remove this from my credit and when I do what they ask then they create a new obstacle for me to me and it just never ends.  

What really irritates me is that I disputed this with Experian every month since I noticed it on my credit report and they refuse to remove it. Today I called them asking them why they didn't think my police report, documents, and images were enough proof to see that this was fraud and wanted to know they came to their decision. I was told that they send in my dispute to Credit One and if Credit One verifies it then it cannot be removed. This has to be the dumbest policy that I have ever heard of. This is like the police contacting the guy that just robbed a bank and asked him if he did it. Then accepting his answer regardless of the evidence. 

Do I have to get a lawyer? I don't know what else to do if Credit One won't remove it because they are the ones that created the scam and none of the credit bureaus will remove it then I don't see another option. Does anyone know of anything else? I refuse to give these scum a nickel. I am sure that the easiest thing to do is to just pay them but I refuse because I never wanted this card, never applied for this card, never used it or even attempted to use it, and so it isn't mine. 

I had some really bad health issues for awhile and was out of work and my credit was terrible for a while.

This is what we're willing to cut out to make this happen. And maybe check in like every 6 months and I feel like that's a lot of money for something so small.

Getting married at the end of next year - is it worth speaking to a tax advisor now? Enrolled Agent or CPA?,"Hey /r/PF!

My fiancee and I are getting married towards the end of next year, and I am aware that you file taxes based on your marital status at the end of the year, so even though we'll be married for only a few months in that year, the entire year will be treated as being married.

My fiancée and I make similar incomes, have no debt, children or property, and we're not anticipating anything changing about that in the next few years.

My questions related mostly to what filing status we should use in 2022 (ie filing separately or jointly):
* I see articles saying you get a higher standard deduction when you file jointly, but looking at it, it seems like the standard deduction for joint filing is exactly 2x the standard deduction for individual filing, so that seems to be break even to me - so what's the deal there?
* I'm confused by how [income restrictions change on Roth IRAs](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2022) - it seems like if you file separately and live with your spouse, it's essentially impossible to contribute?
* Once we've decided our filing status, how should we fill out our W4s? I'm familiar with the [IRS's tax estimator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator), but it's not that helpful with planning for future paychecks, just prior paystubs.

Are these questions nuanced enough to merit speaking to a tax advisor? If so, would speaking to an Enrolled Agent or a CPA be a better bet at this stage?

"50+, mortgage, no dependents, have a nest egg, how much life insurance?","I have no immediate dependents, and have home mortgage as the only debt.

I have a quote from my employer plan at $20/month per $100K and I am thinking of getting up to the mortgage amount.  From what I read though, it is not essential at all for someone in my situation (no net debt, no dependents) to have life insurance. Am I missing something?

New job offer insight,"Early in the interview process I had a very friendly conversation with the recruiter and they asked about my salary expectations. I told them I am open to negotiations but it would be very unlikely for me to accept anything under 80k. We also discussed that while 80k was not actually my ""target"" but it would get the ball rolling if we ever were able to get past the final interview.

So here we are - everything went great during all my interviews and they came back with 80k annually for my salary.

Would it be too much to ask for 90k? I technically never asked for 80k but it's the minimum I said I would go. I was sent their benefits package and noticed a few things....
1) No company match on retirement plan (it's actually a 403(b))
2) No annual bonuses

Invest Replacement Car Fund?,"We all know the reasons why you should not invest your Emergency Fund.  Why shouldn't you invest your car replacement fund?

# Background

In addition to my direct deposit, my employer allows me to split my paycheck up into 16 additional allotments to be deposited into other accounts.  This has allowed me to almost fully automate things.

I have one high yield savings account that I use for my emergency fund and irregular bills (car insurance, water bill, etc.).  I also use this for a few things that are not irregular but I would rather pay using my credit card for rewards then have it debited from an account.  I just move money over to regular checking each pay day to pay for whatever things have posted against the credit card.

In this account, I have my replacement car fund.  I started keeping it here because a few years back I decided to grow my emergency fund and figured I could ""rob myself"" if an emergency came up that I couldn't handle with the existing emergency fund.

# Dilemma

The emergency fund is now fully expanded but I haven't done anything with the car replacement fund.  I shouldn't need the money to buy a replacement car for several years.  Even if a vehicle emergency came up, I have a well padded emergency fund.

# Question

While I can create a hypothetical scenario where it makes better sense not to invest the car fund, it really doesn't seem likely.  What am I missing?  Why shouldn't I invest my car replacement fund?",0,1637083454,261,1461

Stocks and IRA accounts after Death,"Hi Personal Finance,

My father recently passed away in September 2021 and we finally have the death certificates ready to do work on his estate.

His largest asset after death is a Fidelity IRA. I helped manage my dad's finances and he named he is Executor in the will.  He previously had a Fidelity 401k through his employer and after he retired I transitioned it to an IRA and purchased some stocks with it to achieve some growth. The portfolio is 30% stocks/70% bonds. My father passed away at the age of 67 - only 1 year after his retirement.

My question is since this is an IRA for an older individual that passed away - how does it get passed on in to the beneficiaries? For example if I am the main beneficiary can I just get all of the stocks/bonds transferred to my account and I manage it myself?

That situation would be ideal because I do not need to liquidate all of his stocks/bonds and would rather use them to grow and even move more of it to a stock allocation. I wanted to see if there are any rules like RMD (required minimum distributions). The IRA is \~$500k so it can grow to a good amount if I keep purchasing stocks with it. 

In terms of family my mom and myself are the main beneficiaries and my mom trusts me to manage this account since I enjoy stock investments and make a good living for myself. 

Thanks in advance for any guidance. Please let me know if you have any questions.",0,1637082804,262,1411

Edward Jones Fees - Considering Other Options,"My wife has been the one to handle finances and she does a great job.  She called me today to let me know we were making some changes to our Edward Jones, namely a change in the fee structure that will cost us 1% per year.

Can 1% AUM for a financial advisor ever be worth it?,"Hear me out - Last year, my wife and I realized our savings was growing and we should probably do something with it. Fast forward to this year and it’s more than doubled (close to $300K, part was a gift, part due to a new job with a big bump in salary) and we’re still sitting on it all in savings. We’re serious about doing something but have been paralyzed by information and overwhelmed by all the details it feels like we’ll need to manage (investment options, expense ratios, tax implications, etc.)

We met with a financial advisor who claims: “we provide value to our clients by providing comprehensive financial planning solutions – like the Goal Planning &amp; Monitoring dashboard. Our asset management strategies incorporate upwards of 20 different mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds) to optimize the portfolio's risk/reward and tax efficiency.”

I found this sub a few weeks ago, and since then we’ve made some progress on our own.

401Ks - continue to contribute 10%, balance $115K (no change from previous), 100% target date

Roth IRAs - opened and maxed out for this year, 100% target date

I-bonds - purchased $20K, will do another $20K in January, planning to use this as our e-fund

529 - opened (for our daughter) and contributed max amount that is deductible on state income tax for this year, 100% target date

This still leaves us with around $180-200K we would be comfortable investing. But dumping this all into a self-managed brokerage account still feels so overwhelming and nerve wracking. We don’t have the time or energy to spend learning about everything (what seem like simple details to this bunch get overwhelming fast for newbies). In this scenario, is handing the rest over to a financial advisor really so bad? I pay people to change my oil, fix a plumbing issue, trim my trees, etc, all because I don’t have the skills, tools, or time/patience to learn, and I value my time over the couple hundred bucks I might save.

Debt collector for Grandmothers medical bill,"Hello - A few months ago my grandmother went for surgery, for which insurance should have covered everything. 

Unfortunately, my grandmother does not have much assets of her own. My grandfather left her with little to no assets. She is being supported primarily by my parents. 

We have received a hospital bill for a $500 debt and when I had called to question it, it seems that they did not have the insurance on file. 

We are now receiving a letter from a debt collector stating that we owe the $500. 

My understanding is that not paying the debt can lower your credit score, however, I’m not sure if this matters in this case since my grandmother does not support herself and doesn’t have a use for the credit score. I also don’t think they can lower my parents credit score for not paying her medical bill.

Looking for some advice on how to proceed with financing our new home,"We (my wife and I) accepted on offer on our home a couple weeks ago and close on 11/30. We have 1 month free rent back and another month at the new owners prorated mortgage if we need. Just this past weekend we had our offer accepted on a new home. This was the 3rd home we had offered on, and with our finances, we would have only been able to submit an offer contingent on the sale of our home, which would not have worked in this market. So we offered the home with my father-in-law's name on the title/loan, because he has the finances to qualify for an additional mortgage. The idea would've been to buy the home from him later through a real estate lawyer.

But, the current owners of the new home asked for a late closing date (12/28), so in theory, we'd have enough time to switch the title/loan to our name and qualify for a loan ourselves. Complicating the matter, my FIL qualified through Fairway at a 3.25% interest rate with 0 points, and I've seen rates a quite a bit lower online at about 2.875 with 0 or little points (ex. Better.com). The interest rate wasn't the primary concern when my FIL qualified for the loan, it was mostly the ability to close quickly and competition against potential cash offers. The total loan amount on the home would be $528,000, so a difference of that much is something like $142 a month, which isn't nothing.

Some info that may or may not be helpful:

\-Current home is in Oregon, new home is in Washington state

\-We do plan on staying in the new home long-term, 10-20 years or more

Here's what I think our options are:

1. Continue with the plan with my FIL's name on the loan/title, and qualify ourselves separately, and work through a real estate attorney after the fact.
2. Continue like we're buying the home through Fairway with FIL's name on the loan, then down the road, but before closing say we're switching lenders and names on title
3. Switch our names over to the current loan/offer, and refinance later (probably the most expensive option

My credit score right now is not great...like its bad. It is currently a 581. However, that completely stems from credit cards and usage. I have no derogatory remarks, I have never had a late or missed payment, my credit history is good and so on.

I have no interest in rolling this into my 401k (I understand it's more money in the long run and the smart thing to do), but I could really use the extra money for closing costs / moving expenses. It is not an account I contribute to anymore and quite frankly I have been pondering closing it for awhile just to avoid forgetting about it at some point, and thought now would be the ideal time.

My questions:
What are the *rules* for the ""first time home buyer"" IRS 10% tax exception when purchasing your first home? Does it have to be a FHA loan? I am using a VA loan.

Secondly, I would choose to have income tax taken out when closing my IRA. Any ideas what I need to do in order to ensure that I can properly report this come tax time?

Any help would be much appreciated!",0,1637078687,210,1111

"U.S. Expat: Large Savings, how to best handle for investments?","Temp Account for privacy reasons.

I've been working overseas for the last few years and have been saving my money. This was just getting put into my savings since investments for expats always seemed a bit tricky and I had some other personal things to worry about.

Looking to see how to best handle things from here. Been trying to source information online, but alot of things seem to be paid sponsored content via google, and really having trouble sorting out where to find the best advice or getting started.

I have read the 'prime directive' and I'm looking more into /r/investing and /r/ExpatFinance, but wanted to make a post here as well to see if anyone might have some good feedback, experience, or opinions to share.

A lot of it seems to apply to those based in the U.S. with 401k and IRA accounts; both which are off-limits to me as an expat.

&amp;nbsp;

So here are the basics:

* about $100k saved up; no debts, and all living expenses covered by side income and I'm continually saving more each month via main income.
* Technically a U.S. Expat, but only a legal U.S. Tax residency; taxes filed yearly and FACTA compliant.
* Still have U.S. Address / Bank Accounts
* Apparently I can't invest into standard 401k or IRA accounts as expat.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**General Questions**

1. I'd like to get a U.S. Brokerage account that allows me to start investing.
 * Which brokerage is best to use in my case? Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers were recommended to me so far
 * Should I use more than one broker?
 * Do most brokerages also let purchase of crypto or do I need to get another account specifically for that?

1. Where are the best resources to learn how to get started and work towards getting a balanced portfolio?
 *  Online searching seems to pull up a lot of ""paid sponsored' content, so I can't really trust alot of what I search for - are there better resources for getting started that are recommended?
 * How to even find a financial advisor or planner that's good? Is it even necessary?

1. What's the best way to go about starting to invest if I have no experience, I'm always a bit worried that I'll make the wrong moves and I'd like to set up something that's structured and well diversified.

1. What sort of general risks should I be aware of or best practices?

1. Is there a way to 'better' leverage this money to have a better opportunity to growing this into money that lets me retire earlier? combined of course with additional contributions or investment strategies?

&amp;nbsp;

Apologies if any of the questions above seem 'dumb' or 'naïve' - still kinda finding my feet here and hope that some insights from others may help point me in the right direction.",0,1637078373,465,2707
Google play charged my debit card for more than the cost of my purchase?,"Lost story shit, I had some money lying around so I head over to my local 7/11 and bought a Google play card to pay off my subscriptions and stuff without having to use my debit card. I purchased a $60 one and paid off my purchases and still had $10 on it. I decided to treat myself and buy a purchase on game I like but it was $20 so I figured I would just add my card and let it pay the remaining $10. The purchase went through and I saw my receipt and saw it charged me $30?!

I opened by banking up and saw that $30 were missing from my card, so the $20 from the initial purchase plus the $10 left from my card but even worse it TOOK THE MONEY FROM MY GIFT CARD TO. Don't get me wrong I'm certainly not going to lose sleep over 30 dollars but what if it this happens again when I try to do larger purchases.

$10k lump sum into taxable brokerage or Roth 401k?,"Context: 23, $53-60k/yr, no 401k company match until 2022

I am trying to figure out if I should dump some extra money into my Roth 401k through work, or add that money to my taxable brokerage account?

I have been contributing 8% to my Roth 401k since January but don’t get any match until next January, there’s ~$3.5k in it now. Between my taxable brokerage accounts, I have ~$35k. My Roth IRA is already maxed for the year as well. 

I’m debating if I move any money from my taxable brokerage accounts into the Roth 401k because of the retirement benefits. And if not, if I dump any extra income from my next few paychecks into the Roth 401k instead of my taxable accounts?

Moving Debt Consolidation,"Hello all,

My wife, son, and I just moved into our dream forever home!  However in the process of that transition, came a lot of unexpected costs.

Previously; we had about 11,000 each in credit card and now it is at 20,000 each for a total for 40,000.  Long story short, unexpected displacement in a hotel for three weeks; bad advice from mortgage dude (don't pay off/get out of forbearance it doesn't matter if the loan is paid off); significantly higher than anticipated painting costs; and unexpected plumbing problems).  

Our joint income is $186,000 and our credit is each at \~750.  I don't know what to do, we have more plumbing work to be done; and we have another little person coming into the family in May.

I am applying to positions that will hopefully net me \~20-25000 more, but this is where we are currently.   I am looking at balance transfers (which I have done unsuccessfully in the past, and my wife has not), or personal loan which have a brutal commitment (explored Sofi and the added interest to the life of the loan was 20k more!)

I am exploring either the snowball of the avalanche method, but any added insight will be greatly appreciated.

Does it makes sense to get a debt consolidation loan?,"So I moved across the country for a job back in april, only for the job to basically be a pyramid scheme and I was lied to about everything. Anyway, I was between jobs trying to just pay my rent and just recently was able to get a stable job with stable pay. So for the past 6 months my credit card debt has just skyrocketed. It’s embarrassing. I’ve always been so good about my credit cards and I feel like I didn’t have a choice. Anyway, I need to get out of debt quickly but realistically. I have 2 credit cards at the moment. One through citi bank via Costco and one through discover. My citi card is at about a $4k debt and my discover is at about $6k. Together I owe roughly $10K. I don’t have a car payment so my biggest bills are just paying my credit cards and rent. But my apr is like 14% through citi and only like 3% with discover.

Looking to increase retirement savings in my 40's," Hello,

As the title says I'm looking to increase my retirement savings asap at 42 years of age. I'm starting a new job next week that does not match 401k until 1 year of employment, then it's a 3% match. I don't have a Roth or traditional IRA but interested in doing so.

Here's where I'm at currently -

1. Last job was employed for 7 years, 70k annual salary upon leaving, saved roughly 40k in 401k (only job to ever have 401k).
2. I have an emergency fund of around 40k.
3. New job pays 11k more, but no 401k match until 1 year of employment. Do I transfer my old 401k into my new account before contributing?

I currently use USAA but I believe their IRA's have been transferred to Charles Schwab. If I open a IRA with them what type should I open and is there anything worth noting when opening a new IRA? Here's a priority list I referred to before posting.

it goes:

Emergency fund (covered)

401k to match (new employer doesn't match until 1 year of employment, should I focus on IRA until then?)

IRA to limit (what type to open, Roth?)

401k to limit

Should I pay off my education loan in a single payment or keep my company stocks?,"Hello, this is my second post here within a short period of time.

I will be vesting some of my employer stock in Feb 2022. I plan on using that money to pay off my student debt + kitchen remodelling for our house. 
My employer is considered a growth stock, and people expect the stock to go 10x or more within the next few years ~5-8 ish would be their bets I'd imagine. 
So do you think I'm missing out on more gains by selling those stocks or is a guaranteed ~10-12% return always worth it? 

P.S. if I don't use funds coming up this Feb, I may end up using some of the stocks I vest later on in the year or from a past employer, I have those stocks but they're under moratorium to sell till summer next year but none of those will fully cover my debt payments.",0,1637076555,198,1038

Best time to ask for a raise is today. Second best time is around the end of your company's fiscal year.,"Prepare yourself with a list of goals you accomplished and future goals. Send an email and make sure you CC the person above your boss to ensure it's known you are serious. In most businesses money is allocated properly throughout the year so barging in today may not be the best method if your company operates on a fiscal year ending June 30th as you're almost halfway through it at this point. If this is something that you're not prepared for instead work with your management for goals that seemingly align with the fiscal year. Also ensure that you mention any training opportunities that you may wish to partake in so your management can properly obtain authorization and funding. 

Each week there's extreme examples of how to ask for a raise which usually are examples of pulling big power moves or leaving your company. Sometimes stating why you're the best at your position in writing and how you can improve if in a different position or encouraged with more salary is the best path forward. At best, you get what you want. At worst, you realize you've hit your wall, and it's then best to either stay at that wall if you're comfortable or find a new job.

I'm also at school and working a regular part-time job is not an option, since I still live with my parents and they want me to focus solely on school (which I already do well enough with nice grades). I just need some advice to finally set myself free, travel and save more money to stay well in university.

I accidentally overcontributed to my Roth IRA. How can I fix this?,"Like the title says, I overcontributed to my Roth IRA by about $6,000.  My contributions through my job were allocated to a Roth, and I also set up a separate Roth through TD Ameritrade.  Both are maxed out, and I didn't realize that the overall total limit was $6,000 a year, not $6,000 PER Roth.

Best way to compare health insurance plans,"It’s enrollment season. The broader topic is: what is the best resource to figure out the best health insurance plan? Go!


Personal set: wife and I both started new jobs this year as well as had a baby. She was unemployed at the time she had a minor surgery plus our son had an unexpected ER visit. We had a HDHP and maxed HSA but now we’re wondering if that’s the best route given how this year we basically hit a $6000 deductible and the alternative would have been a PPO with the $1000 deductible.

Can someone help clarify the wiki on Roth vs Traditional?,"“Mid income: If you're in the 22% or 24% federal tax bracket, you should probably read the long version. Sorry! Note that if you decide on Traditional contributions (401(k) and/or IRA) and those bring your MAGI down enough that your marginal tax rate is definitely 12% then you should almost certainly make Roth contributions (401(k) and/or IRA) for the remainder of the year.”

I am married filing jointly with a taxable income of ~$100k and max out my Roth 401k. With the standard deduction, my AGI is ~$75k, which means the money I put into my Roth is taxed at the 12% rate. I expect a pension and other retirement income so it makes sense to me to put money into Roth instead of traditional. 

However, I currently have some non-taxable income that I expect to convert to taxable in a few years that will bump me to ~$125k taxable, which is where I’m confused. 

With a standard deduction it’s about $100k AGI. Contributing to traditional would lower that to ~$80k, which puts all of my income in the 12% bracket. If I put it in Roth, my AGI is still ~$100k and the money I put in Roth is taxed at the marginal rate of 22% or 24%. 

The Wiki says I should put it in Roth, but aren’t I exposing myself to additional tax unnecessarily? Am I just hedging against future tax increases or jumps in salary?",0,1637072755,238,1304

Did the bank make a colossal mistake by not becoming a lienholder on my vehicle?,"If there was a ""no stupid questions legal advice off topic"" sub reddit, I would have posted there, but here goes.

I live and purchased a vehicle in Connecticut, financed by my old credit union in New York, two and a half years ago. So after making payments for 30 months, I get a letter from the credit union demanding to be placed on the title as a lien holder. (They done goofed up, and they only caught it now?). When I initially bought the vehicle, it was financed by a third party bank, who does appear on the title as lien holder, and when I refinanced with the credit union, they sent a payout letter to the 1st bank. So in my position I have both the title only listing the 1st bank, and a payout letter from the credit union. What does that mean..hypothetically speaking..of course, like if I wasn't the upstanding person I am could I just tell them to suck it, I have the title, and a letter saying the vehicle was paid off, and I'm not making anymore payments on a vehicle that I already own?

Like i said, I should have posted in ""no stupid questions"". There is a loan agreement that was signed by me that I would pay for the vehicle, and there is a long history of me making payments, etc. etc. The situation just got me to wondering what all the implications of this might be.",0,1637072165,244,1291
Steps for selling my house to a tenant who has been renting from me,"I have owned a house for nearly 20 years.  2 years ago I moved into my girlfriend's house and I began leasing my house it to a tenant. His current lease runs until next September and he has told me that he wants to buy his own house, and is interested in buying mine if I am willing to sell.  I think it could be a good move for both of us.  I do not really feel like dealing with any other future tenants if he were to decide to move.  I am hoping to have my first child next year and may eventually require moving into a bigger house with my girlfriend and baby - and could use the funds from my own home sale to make that transition easy.  I am also confident that I can invest the profits wisely and make similar returns to what I am making off the current rental.

A few questions have come up as I have never sold a property before.

1.  Since I have found my own buyer, can I cut realtors / home inspections out of the equation?
2. What kind of savings would this give me? - I am willing to pass on some of this savings and give my tenant a slightly-better-than-market price that is beneficial for both of us.
3. Who else would need to be involved in the sale? I assume I would need a lawyer to draft documents?
4. If my tenant takes out a new mortgage to buy the house - do I get one check from his bank for the home sale?  I am estimating the house is worth about $225k and I currently owe $35k.  Would I have a tax expense from the property sale?
5. What else am I not considering?  I would like to let him know in the next few months what my plans are.",0,1637072076,319,1563
Chance I will be approved for HELOC loan with considerably less income this year than last?,"In 2020 I made $119,000 gross.

Will Being a Guarantor Hurt My Ability to Secure a Mortgage?,"My sister recently moved to a new part of the country for her job. The opportunity came up very suddenly, so she’s been living in temp housing and trying to find a more permanent living situation.

She found a three bedroom apartment she really likes and a potential roommate but they have been having trouble finding a third. My Dad offered to be a guarantor, but he is retired so his income no longer meets the threshold.

I think my income is enough for me to be a guarantor for her (180k, the total rent for the year id be guaranteeing is 32k), but I’m also hoping to apply for a mortgage in the next few months and don’t know what kind of affect this will have on my eligibility. I am otherwise well positioned to secure a mortgage, I’m hoping to get approved for ~650k

"Need advice, traumatic skateboard accident along with my poor decisions have lead me to a debt crossroads","So I'm sure you guys get these similar stories about hardship, credit cards, and loans. I am not here for pity or for a lecture about how horrible i am with money. I just have a handful of questions that are too specific to find answers without calling some places or asking here. Thanks.Sorry this ended up being very long, you can skip to the end for my question if your actually interested in giving me some advice, which i greatly appreciate! 

So..... I'm not great with money, i make bad decisions. I buy expensive audio and recording equipment that i probably shouldn't own. I wasn't in debt but i had myself set up for disaster. i have a $400 car payment, 400$ rent, another $300 between phone and insurance, at least another $300 in misc subscriptions and bills from Sweetwater, and about 3 months ago i decided to finance a new Martin D28, that's about $250 a month. I make about 2.2k a month after taxes, so I was already stretched thin but i always pay all of my bills and keep my 3 credit cards paid off.

In august I had gotten back into skateboarding after a few year hiatus, I'm 31. it was a great way to exercise for me. Then one day just cruising i managed to fuck up really bad, i fell and somehow shattered my pelvis and broke my Acetabulum, i had to get a major surgery and they had to basically screw me back together, yay! 

Its now Nov, i still cant walk, but am lucky that I'm am essential to the operation of the business i work for so as soon as it happened my boss gave me a couple hundred bucks and let me do some work from home but it was only bringing in about $300 a month, not good. I went back to work after about a month and a half. I'm now making a lot less because I'm not able to work as much. I'm making about 1600 a month now but that will slowly change back to what i was making. During the time i wasn't able to work i had to use all of my available credit to pay my bills, luckily i have a wonderful fiance who paid for all of my food and whatnot, but i still racked up about 6k in cc debt, now its very difficult for me to catch up, all of my CCs are maxed and late. My bank account is negative all the time and I'm barley managing my car payment which I've prioritized as well as my insurance and phone. My credit score dropped from close to 700 to around 500 in that short time. Im also becoming a burden to my wonderful fiance who has already had to basically wipe my ass for a few months, i hate that, but am lucky to have her. Luckily my 100k in medical bills was completely wiped out through a charity type financial assistance program, thank god! Not having insurance really worked out in this scenario. 

I'm extremely grateful for how this turned out honestly with the medical bills and my poor financial decisions i should be in a much much worse position. I completely understand that and am not trying to make anyone feel sorry for me in any way i feel extremely lucky. I honestly feel guilty that I have people who care and so many things went right at a time when so many people are so less fortunate. 

So, all three of my cards are stupid high interest 20+% APR, The minimum payments plus interest is too much for me to handle right now. After a few months of getting paid i can get back to being ok but its going to take me selling some gear and eating cheap, i already have listed a few expensive items on Reverb. I was looking into consolidating, the options on KreditKarma are a fucking joke, my credit score being so low is probably the reason. The options are all like 25% 30% APR and my car as collateral, i don't know who would actually fall for that. My question, finally, sorry, is....... Is there a better place i could go and say get a 5k lower interest loan with my car as collateral, i would assume putting my car up would drop the interest down to a reasonable 5-10%, is that ignorant of me? i know nothing about finances, obviously. Also, if that is a possibility, do you think it would be a good idea considering my circumstances? I just hate paying hundreds of dollars to these companies for basically nothing. In an ideal situation i could get a 5k loan with low interest and pay it off in a year or two and avoid all of these damn interest charges every month, they are really crippling my progress.  I also do not want to have to sell my beloved guitars and gear but i am willing to do that if necessary, i just would lose a lot and end up never being able to replace the guitars, the two i have were 3k+ back before all of the online taxes and wood importing fees. In todays market they would be closer to 5k but it would take me years to sell them at a similar price., which i don't want to do, they are my favorite things in the world. Also, i tried returning the D28 that i bought a month before my accident and they were not having it because in my crippled state i accidentally knocked a heavy item into it cosmetically damaging it, it was a bad fucking month. 

Thanks for anyone who actually read this and is helping me figure out what to do, no matter what i know ill be fine, I just don't want to make any more poor decisions that lead me to a place where I'm actually fucked, THANKS!",0,1637070697,1000,5175

Should I take out a life insurance policy for my mom?,"I've been doubting whether I should apply for a life insurance policy for my mom (46F).

A bit of background: my father died 6 years ago. He didn't have any insurance whatsoever so the funerals cost were a heavy burden on us. I regret that I didn't take out a life insurance policy for him.
Also paying of his debt (10k)

My parents are first generation immigrants. They don't really understand finance/retimerent planning. Also talking about money in our culture is awkward/weird.

My plan:
Apply for a life insurance policy for my mom. The term would be until she reaches age 74. If she dies before age 74 the insurance company will pay out. If she dies after that age the company won't.

For a €500k policy it's about €75 a month.

I'll be the one paying for it because my mom can't afford it.

My reasoning is that when she dies we could use the money to pay off any debts that she has and pay for her funeral. Also it can also be used to pay off any debts that I (32M) or my siblings (34F, 27M) have.

Inheritance of Car with debt,"Hello I have a question about Inheritance of a vehicle from a person with debt. 

My girlfriend's father is very I'll and we fear he won't make it. It's gotten worse and we think he might pass by the end of today. One issue both my girlfriend, and her mother worry about is that the father technically owns my girlfriend's car. He is the title owner, and the car is registered in his name (New York). The worry is that due to some debt he had before this incident, and the massive medical debt that he has accrued from a nearly 2 week stay in the ICU is that the IRS will seize his assets, including this car. The car is important to us because it belonged to my girlfriend's sister who had passed a few years ago.

"Have a job offer in Denver, concerned about being able to purchase a home","I was offered a job in Denver paying $85k, my wife is in a high demand field and will realistically make $60-70k when she lands a job.  Both are government jobs, so while the salaries seem low, health insurance is very cheap (no cost for high deductible plans, very affordable low deductible plans) and we get other benefits.


As for a snapshot of our finances, we have no debt besides $8k left on a car loan ($250/mo is what I've been paying, the minimum is more like $125).  ~800 credit scores. We have no kids, and do not plan to have any in the future.  We have about $40k cash on hand and roughly $30k equity in our current house.  We have around $7k combined in HSA's, and around $60k tied up in pension accounts in our current state.  I also have $12k in a Roth IRA.  Yes I have way too much cash on hand, but I just sold a car in preparation for the move and have not invested it yet.


I guess the rub is that our household income is only increasing by about $10k, but we are moving from Arkansas so we currently have a lot of disposable income.  Our hobbies are low cost for the most part (mountain biking, motorcycling, hiking, camping etc).  However, I do require a house/apartment with a garage.  This makes Denver area a very expensive place to live, and it appears that even the suburbs are no longer affordable.  A significant portion of our current income is spent vacationing out west, so that's just money in our pocket if we pack up and move there.  We don't eat out a lot, drive cheap cars, and have old/cheap phones and things like that.  My budget shows it will work comfortably, but man a $500k house that's smaller than what we currently have sure looks scary to me.  I also keep reading horror stories about the bidding wars, forfeiting inspections, paying $50k over the appraised value etc.  I'm ok making sacrifices because Colorado is our dream destination, however, I don't want to commit financial suicide and I don't want to rent the rest of my life.


TL;DR, is home ownership on a ~140-150k household income in a west/southwest Denver suburb a realistic dream anymore?  Or should we stay where we're at?  Thanks!",0,1637066127,402,2147

Assuming it takes a month to go through the interview process and make a decision, does it look bad to hop that soon after starting a job?",0,1637066033,110,586
Wondering if this makes financial sense to other people - would like a few opinions before I go through with it.,"I'm self-employed and in Ireland. Hoped I tagged this correctly.

I managed to save over 10k last year, with some of which I was going to buy a van and convert it to a ninja camper ( looks like a normal workvan from outside) so I could park and sleep anywhere while working away from home, as I often do for weeks at a time, to save on accommodation costs.

Instead of buying a van straight, I took a secured loan of 10k, paid half the van and took the other half on finance, used the rest of the secured loan to pay off the installments on both loans. Point was to create a credit score, as I was basically off grid for a decade and now I'm looking at get a mortgage at some point. This obviously costs a few hundred extra but if it gets me a large loan down the line I'm ok with that. Paid off the vehicle finance early and have 5k of the secured loan left. So now the van is fully mine and can't be touched, if something were to happen financially, even though the original loan hasn't been balanced. I think it worked out well.

My partner's car is falling apart at the seems and she needs a new(er) one. Not going into the details there but I'll be buying it.

So, as I see it, I have 5k left on a 10k secured loan (another 4 years on the term)  and will need to buy a car for 6-8k. I can scrape about 5k together I think by January.

Am I right in thinking I'm better to pay off the secured loan early, then take a smaller secured loan for the price of the car and keep the same term?

Using the loan calculator on the website, my monthly will go down by about €35. I'd be paying for as long as I would have anyway and Ill have an upgraded car.

I'm not sure if this is viable or if there's something I'm not factoring, it seems to make too much sense!

What does it mean to save 30% of tips for taxes?,"I live in Michigan. I have never worked before so I’ve never had to do taxes (also haven’t turned 18 yet but will in a few months). I’m looking into bartending at least temporarily in the future and I saw some bartenders recommend to save 30% of your tips to pay taxes. I don’t really understand what this means. All I really know about the taxes you have to file is that they’re taken from your income tax, but what confuses me is whether or not you have to give in money when you do your taxes. 
I know that tips are taxed, which would make sense with tips done by credit/debit card because it can be done automatically but I don’t understand how it would work with cash tips or especially card and cash tips combined. Do you have to save that 30% of the tips to turn in with your taxes?

Seeking recommendation: Close unused secured credit card?,"Hi, I currently have two credit cards:

1)A secured credit card with a credit union through a checking account with them, $0 annual fee, entirely unused for the past 4 to 5 years, had for at least 7 to 8 years. $500 credit limit.
2)Citi double cash back, $0 annual fee, used whenever I make a purchase,had for at least 4 to 5 years. $10,000 credit limit.
I have not applied for any other credit card in the last 4 to 5 years. My FICO score is around 750.

I like to keep things organized and started looking into getting another credit card but I dislike having my secured credit card around. I dislike the credit union's website and the credit card barely has any reward or benefit. I think I get 1 point per $1 spent but each point is like 0.001 worth. I've been wanting to close the credit card but I am unsure if I should. I could upgrade the secured card to a credit card with a 1.5% cash back on everything but like I said in the above, I dislike my credit union's website. It's clunky and I have security concerns (no 2FA and password limit of 6 characters. Yes 6.).

I do not plan on buying a house or taking a loan in the near future but I would prefer my credit score to not drop significantly.

What would you recommend? Keep the card, upgrade the card, or close the card+checking account, or a 4th option (if there is one)???",0,1637064471,250,1337
Is a useful store credit less valuable than cash?,"I’m looking to buy something that costs about US$200 and I have two options. I can buy from Amazon and use store card rewards to pay only $100 out of pocket. Or I can buy from somewhere else that has it for about 10% off, but I cannot use any credit card rewards. Cash back is more or less a wash (2% back on the $200 or 5% back on the 100). 

The first option represents less cash out of pocket. But Amazon is such a flexible purchasing option that the credit there is about as close to cash as any store credit is going to be. Should I treat it as good-as-cash and take 10% off buying elsewhere? Or should I value actual cash out of pocket higher than the Amazon credit?",0,1637062872,133,672

"Retired and immigrating to the US, where to put out money?","Hello Reddit,

This is a throwaway account.

I would like to get some advice on where to park our money for a low risk passive income that will not erode over time due to inflation while still giving us around $40k per year. 

We are definitely not looking to be landlords again when moving, it’s too much of a headache.

Here are a few points:
- My wife and I are in our 70s and living in the Middle East.
- We are tired of being landlords.
- We would like to move closer to our grandchildren.
- We have a few investment properties which we use as our passive income.
  - We purchased them when we were younger and still working
  - They were purchased before getting our green card to the US
  - They depreciated in value before getting our green card to the US

---

We are thinking of selling all of our properties and moving to New York state. My questions are as follows:

**Question 1:**
Since the properties were purchased and depreciated in value before getting the green card, how will we get taxed on them? Do we get capital loss or capital gains? We would like to accurately plan for this. 

**Question 2:**
Once our money is transferred to the US (after taxes) what is a good low risk passive income to invest our money in so that we can make around $30k to $40k per year and not lose value due to inflation? (The total value will be between $700 and $1mil)",0,1637061100,250,1370

What is a good credit card for travel perks (beginner)?,"My husband and I are an international couple. I live overseas from my family and we both travel frequently. We're looking to start building credit as neither of us has had a credit card in a very long time (I haven't had one since I was 16) and we're hoping to buy property within the next decade. 

I want to go for a card that will give us some decent travel benefits, while still being beginners when it comes to building credit. We probably wouldn't be eligible for any of the better cards at this point but I'd like to build towards that. 

Would it be recommended to apply for a card that's associated with a specific airline? Or a card that offers travel benefits all around? Preferably, I wouldn't want to commit to a particular airline because we need flexibility when it comes to finding the best prices. Our travel needs mainly involve flights, not necessarily hotels or rental cars, as we're mostly traveling to visit friends and family at this stage, and we have some other great resources for accommodations (Hotels Tonight baby!).

I have access to credit card options in the US and my husband has access to options in the UK - we live in the UK. Just something to take into consideration in terms of international transaction fees and the like.

We're still trying to wrap our heads around credit and I don't feel like either of us has gotten the best education in the topic. We've both avoided credit cards thus far because of their bad reputations. We've both been taught that it's best not to spend money that you don't have, or that credit cards can spell trouble, although both of our parents have credit cards and use them responsibly, for specific purposes, perks, and to build credit. - If you have any recommendations for educational resources online, please point me in the right direction! I've come across a few Youtubers who discuss the topic but I'm not sure who's giving the best advice.

"Girlfriend (21) needs $2600 to pay off her school, which she doesn't have, really need help looking at her options","So my girlfriend is currently in college, but has been failing her classes resulting in her getting placed on academic probation . Wish she'd told me she's been failing the whole time (few months ago) because she seemed to just ignore her classes straightout and didn't even consider asking the school to withdraw from the classes . So now she owes about $2600 which then placed her in financial probation, and apparently she needs to pay that before she can proceed to take classes again . This is money that she does not have, and the school needs confirmation on what she wants to do by the 17th (tomorrow) and the money by the 24th (I think) . I've looked around online on what she can do in her situation and I really couldn't find anything . Even if she asks for a loan her credit score is around 600 and she still has other debt to pay .

  


This really frustrates me because the whole time I've been trying to support her and teach her how to be better at saving money but she still has no control over her terrible saving/spending habits, . I was torn on the inside when I found out she was failing her classes for months in a row, and at that time I had quit my job to figure things out for my self while I was giving her rides to and from work, so you can understand why I was so torn about it . It really hurts me to see her in situations like these when I have warned her multiple times about what would happen . I even try my best to be her spending habits in check and her schoolwork done . For September and October she had A's on her classes but for this month she decided to take a month off and withdraw from the class (said she needed to grieve about her grandmother but she just felt lazy, this is something she told me) .

  


She currently makes about $1700 per month and has $700 of bills to pay every month (groceries not included), maybe even more since her sister might plan on backing out of their phone contract (started about a month ago). I can't help her out since I have my own bills to pay and have a lot to pay by the end of this year.

  


She's always had a problem with piling problems up for herself and making it stack up until it comes crashing down on her . And I really do want to help her out, but I just don't know how. Sorry if this post turned into a sort of rant . If any further information is needed please ask and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability .

  


TL;DR: Girlfriend with ~$1000 in debt and a600 credit score needs $2600 to pay off her retake fees for school . If she gets a loan she wants to borrow more if possible to buy a cheap car so she can maybe find a better paying job. Have no idea how to help her out .",0,1637050375,534,2691
Should I rollover my Traditional 401k to Roth IRA?,"So here's my situation. I'm about 39M, and, with my wife, make about 450k per year. We both max out our 401k per year as well as do the backdoor Roth IRA. I started a new job, and have around 260k in a traditional 401k from my previous employer. 

I'm thinking of rolling over some or all of this into my Roth IRA so the money can grow tax free, but I'm a little concerned due to the tax hit I'll take. I'm in a pretty high tax bracket already (35% + state taxes ouch!) so any amount we rollover would get taxed at this rate, and we also should ensure we don't leak into the next tax bracket. But it is enticing that, after I take the tax hit this year, any capital gains I make from this money will be tax free when I retire.

Is there a reason for a young and healthy individual to make significant contribution to an HSA if they are not maxing out their 401k?,"I see a lot of advice around here and otherwise that always seems to encourage a max contribution to an HSA. However, I don't fully understand the logic behind this. I know you can never plan when you may get very sick or an accident may occur and that eventually some significant health related expense will likely arise, but given how far down the line that will most likely be if at all, I find it hard to see why I would contribute more than my company match. 

I feel like this is doubly less straightforward than I often read if one is not maxing out their 401k as well. At least with a 401k you will certainly be using the funds at some point versus having them accumulate in an account you will hopefully never have to use for its intended purpose. Furthermore, since you pay a penalty to use HSA funds for other purposes, it would always make sense to max the 401k first, right?

Cash Out Refi - Primary House,"Guys, I’m thinking about doing a cash out refi. Here is the stats:

- Cash Out Amount: $300K
- New Loan Amount: $890K
- Interest Rate: 2.99% (3.01% APR)
- New Monthly Mortgage Payment (principal + interest only): $3.8K
- Current Monthly Mortgage Payment (principal + interest only): $2.5K
- Remaining equity (after refi): more than 20% of the current fair value
- After Tax Monthly Income: $11.5K
- After taken into account property tax, maintenance, child care, car payment, monthly expenses, I have $1K left. 
- I don’t count bonus here since it changes year over year. I assume it is about $20K - $30K every year. I get this as a lump sums at the end of the year.
- Use of the $300K: 
   + $100K: Divide equally into FAANG
   + $200K: Go into SP500 index 
- With the 10% average return on the SP500, I will make 20K each year. FAANG is unknown but let’s just say 5%. So in total, it is $25K per year. The difference in interest only is about $10K per year. So I’m making $15K each year, which equates to 5% net return.

"FIL died - likely nothing was planned for - advice for NY state on property sale, inheritance, etc.","So my father in law died and to be quite honest, he kept a lot from my MIL. I'm assuming nothing was planned out for his passing since he refused to discuss any aspect of finances with MIL.  The state of residency is NY.  


From a cursory reading of NY intestate laws, it appears the spouse inherits 50k plus half of the remaining balance and the children inherit the rest.  His children (wife, wife's sister and wife's brother who is (hopefully) conserved due to being severely developmentally delayed want the mother to have the entire estate.   


Questions:   
1. Is there a lot of paperwork involved in permitting MIL to assume the entirety of the estate?

2. Is there an easy way to find out what debt exists from FIL, including back taxes, credit cards, lines of credit, etc?  There was a lot of secrecy so I don't trust that MIL knows where all those skeletons are buried.

3. Does auto title transfer to surviving spouse even if she's not on it?

4. Assuming she is on the house title, what are the hurdles she will need to get over in order to sell the house? It's in disrepair and much to much home for her to handle on her own but until the house sells she won't be able to afford a smaller place nor would she likely qualify for a loan as I assume her credit is fairly bad.

5. If our goal is to move her and the BIL into a relatively safe, secure and intact home (translated: house that doesn't have a giant gaping hole in the roof in Western NY winters) what is the best way to do so with the least tax implications?  Assuming wife and I could either a) pay cash for a modest home b) qualify to purchase a second home with 20% down in cash c) cosign a loan for MIL which option offers the least tax implications or unnecessary cost of transfer?  Essentially the goal would be to move her and her stuff and BIL to a stable home and then do the necessary repairs on the old home to sell it to a buyer.  Selling ""as is"" seems a bit risky given that winter is approaching and there is a giant hole in roof.  But repairs would be best done without occupants, IMO.

Amazon claims to have received the wrong item and refuses to refund me.,"Hi there, I'm a bit new to this but I need help.

After receiving nothing for a total of 13 days (Nov 7th), I receive an email from **buyer-returns@amazon.com** claiming that one of the items I sent (VR Power) was the wrong item serial number and that they were going to discard it, to which I responded claiming otherwise and even sent proof (the receipt) of dropping the package off at UPS  
Two days later (Nov 9th), I received an email from **cs-reply@amazon.com** telling me to respond to the email I received on Nov 7th and to wait 3 days for a response from their specialists, so I did, explaining again that I did in fact send the correct item.  
Fast forward to yesterday (the 15th), the refund was issued.  


However, sadly, that's not where this ends.   
As I mentioned before I sent **two** items back  
I contacted amazon upon seeing the refund for the ***VR Power*** issued, wondering where the refund for the Oculus Quest 2 was as well, and after having the call drop the first time around, I called again, went through the process, and got transferred to a specialist just for them to tell me **again** to respond to the email I got on Nov. 7th regarding the VR Power... but I also conveniently got an email while on the phone with them saying they received the wrong item for the **Oculus Quest 2**  


After responding to the November 7th email a 3rd time, I got an email later on telling me to contact them by phone because there are details they need to ask me for that can't be discussed over email.  
So, I follow their link and call them again. I talked to a representative, then got transferred yet again to a specialist, who ""investigated"" the matter, claimed that they couldn't help me any further, interrupted and talked over me, and hung up.

Converting SEP IRA to Roth,"Freelancer here. All accounts are Vanguard accounts

I have an SEP IRA with 40K in it that I've had for 5+ years now.  However, in 2022, I am moving to a Individual 401K because I'll be making enough to max it out and save even more for retirement. I'm fine with leaving the SEP as in in my account.  I'm invested in decent funds that give me good returns.  This is more about streamlining my accounts than anything else. 

My question are: 

1. should I convert the SEP to a Roth? 

2. If so, do I do it in 2021 or in 2022? 

3. Will I owe taxes if I convert from the SEP to a Roth?",0,1637040185,119,583
Should I buy a new car or save up for a used one for food delivery to save money on gas?,"I have a bmw e46 2002 which I've been delivering food through Doordash and Ubereats for 8 months now.

Thoughts on value of AmEx Delta rewards + downgrading after a year,"Hi, all! I'm having a hard time evaluating the use of the Delta Gold American Express credit card and whether it'll be possible to downgrade it to the Blue option (with no annual fee) a year in. 

I fly with Delta and its partners fairly frequently so I was looking into the Delta Gold card, which comes with offers for 70k miles (typically it's 40k miles without any special offers). The $99 annual fee is waived the first year, and I was thinking about fulfilling the contractual obligations to get the full mileage offered and then calling to request a downgrade just before the first annual fee kicks in to request the Blue card which offers similar perks (fewer miles earned per dollar spent, but still not a bad deal). My questions are two-fold:

1)  How successful are people who call requesting to downgrade their card to one without an annual fee? I've read that it's possible (and I've seen scripts online showing you how to request it), but I can't figure out the chance that I can actually do this. I don't want to have a card with a $99 fee that I have to pay for years on end, so if downgrading isn't an option then the perks aren't worth it to me since my other two credit cards are optimized for cash back and travel.

2)  I can't evaluate how good the perks on this card are and I'm hoping for some insight from someone who may have it. I have another credit card (mastercard) with no foreign transaction fees and no annual fee, so I'd be covered if I chose traveled to a place where  amex wasn't widely-accepted. I'd like this card for the initial mileage offer, plus the ability to accrue some miles overtime (however slowly it happens). However, I can't tell if there is something I'm missing whereby it's actually a better deal to stick to my cash back card.

How should I handle 2022 Roth contributions if I may be just over the single income limit?,"For the last few years or so, I've made a habit of saving the cash for the next year to fully invest into my Roth IRA in January.  Same this year, I have $6000 in a savings account ready to invest.

That said, this year I will likely fall somewhere in the personal filer income range.   My salary (not including at likely CoL increase in March?) will be just under the income limit.  And company performance this year makes it likely that I will get a decent bonus, maybe 5%.  Which would put me over the minimum Roth income limit, but not necessarily above the the max.

How do I approach this?,"Throwaway account, but I could use some advice on this situation.

By “everything” they mean an entire company, several million dollars worth of assets and I have no idea how much their actual net worth is. The problem is that they don’t seem to have any concern about a will or anything to solidify this. Where the concern comes from is that while my mom was their only child, and she has passed away, my grandfather does have another daughter who he didn’t know about until about 15 years ago who is now slightly part of their lives. Additionally, our extended family will absolutely lawyer up and try to get their hands on anything they can.

What to do with a chunk of cash from a mortgage refinance?,"We recently refinanced our home and took out a considerable chunk of cash at an interest rate of 2.87%. We've always been cash poor and figured this could be our last chance for nearly free bank money.

"Have a rough plan for post graduation, would like some eyes on it if possible!","Hey all, I am graduating this December and am fortunate enough to have gotten a job with a really nice salary starting in January! I have some plans for my current and future financial situation, and would love to get some eyes on it if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me currently:

\- \~$7,000 in a generic investment account through a big bank (managed by them with a high volatility goal)

\- \~$12,000 in a ROTH IRA account through a big bank (managed by them with a high volatility goal)

\- \~$2,000 in a generic savings account

\- a small amount of money in checking

&amp;#x200B;

I will begin working at a large company in January, and am confused on where to invest and save my money going forward, and how much percentages of paychecks. I will be living with my parents and having little to no expenses for roughly a year, and then plan on getting an apartment with my SO until we get married and get a house. Big goals, right? So some big things I want to start saving up for now!

&amp;#x200B;

My current thoughts for when I start earning money are divided into three categories where my money will go (this is little to no expenses).

* Max out my company's saving plans (they will match up to 6% of my eligible contributions) and, once that's maxed out, max out my ROTH IRA. This will be roughly 20% of my biweekly paycheck.
* Save in a generic savings account roughly 50% of my biweekly paycheck towards my aforementioned goals. 
* Have some money laying around for the small expenses I will incur, roughly 30% of my biweekly paycheck.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I move out and start to live with my SO in an apartment, these numbers will tweak slightly, with more money being used for expenses and less money saved (maybe swap to 30% saved, 50% expenses), but it will be the same idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this general guideline good for the future? I am still a little confused about investing (should I even bother with the ROTH? just keep putting into 401k? or is there a point once my employer's contributions are matched), but I think this is currently how I want to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also thinking about closing out the generic investing account that is managed by my bank to use that for the big, aforementioned expenses, but I think I won't do that until I need to actually make those expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text -- this is all very daunting, so I kind of just vomitted all of my thoughts on here! Please let me know if this isn't the right place for this, or if you have any advice for me. Thanks :)",0,1637039041,447,2557

I want to become very financially literate,"I am an early 30's male with a career in Business Administration (I have a BBA as well). I am arriving at the point in my life and career where I can leverage my experience to get investors on board for start up businesses. On a personal level, I have some money to invest. I have been fortunate enough to be able to lean on the advice of experienced friends &amp; family, but I want to be able to fill that role myself. The reason I ask here rather than in r/FinancialCareers is because I am not interested in becoming a financial professional like a wealth manager, but to be able to leverage my financial knowledge to improve my personal life as well as my professional career.

In the upcoming months I can spend an average of \~10 hours a week or more on studying. I have set a goal for late 2022 to achieve the following:

* On a personal level, be more than capable of handling personal wealth, analyzing investment opportunities, and so on. I already know a decent bit about how to be a passive investor, now I want to learn about being a more active one, even if just in theory.
* On a professional level, be competent enough in financial analysis and corporate finance to be able to inspire confidence in investors who (considering to) invest in my business. I already know a lot of the basics through experience so I don't need to learn how a cash flow works or anything like that.

I want to do this right. If I spend the time on it, I want to spend it on a course provided by an accredited institution *even if* I only do the learning and never actually get the certificate. Things I have considered so far:

* CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) level 1, although I hear even the first level is hard as balls. It's international acclaim is quite appealing though.
* CMA (Certified Management Accountant). This one might go a bit too far in to the accountant side of things.
* CISI (Chartered Institute for Investment &amp; Securities) has a variety of courses, but seems to have less material available. All in all potentially the most realistic choice.
* CII (Chartered Insurance Institute) has been mentioned as well.

So what would you guys recommend for the goals I have set? What would make you say ""man, this person really knows his stuff"" without going as far as becoming a hedgefund manager? What knowledge would give you extra confidence that this start up business is appropriately financially literate?

"Tax rate of 68%, ways to decrease tax burden?","Throwaway account, hopefully this is the right subreddit to ask:

I live in NYC and work in tech and this year my income has increased significantly due to a new company policy that disburses a monthly bonus, similar to commission but tied to company performance instead of individual.

My salary is 156K, but including the bonus bumps up to 622k to date (estimating will end closer to \~660k by the end of the year).

Currently, I'm maxing out my 401k contribution and \~2k into FSA.

After deductions (401k, FSA, insurance, etc.), of the 622k I've had 371k withheld for taxes. After speaking with my tax attorney, they are estimating I will still owe an additional \~50k when I file this year's tax returns (-70k federal taxes, +20k state/NYC refund). This is because my company is withholding 22% of the bonus, but I will have to pay the difference of my tax bracket (37%). The other taxes come from additional medicare, FICA, medicare, state, and city withholding.

So my income at 622k to date, 371k taxes withheld plus the 50k I'll owe means that my take-home is ONLY \~32%, with 68% going to taxes. I feel like I'm missing something here? I have no problem paying my fair share in taxes, but 68% going to Uncle Sam seems absolutely insane.

"Zero interest credit card balance, pay it off now or later?","So I have about $6000 of debt related to my crypto mining business that I financed with zero interest for the first 12 months. After that period it will begin charging me a 18-22% variable interest rate.

I have been making the minimum payments in fiat (roughly $60) and stacking the mining profits in an interest earning account.

Current profits are roughly in the $600-800/month range after electricity, rent, and taxes. Of course it varies in terms of USD with the overall market.

Now I understand that paying down this debt would be a top priority if I were paying interest on it but given that I am paying nothing in interest I was thinking it may be better to continue making the minimum payment and then aggressively paying it down once I start owing interest.

Does this make sense or am I better off just paying this down as fast as humanely possible now?

Now, I am not counting on this but I also have the option to take out a collateralized loan against my digital assets at a far lower interest rate (1-7%). If the market pulls back I can post more collateral to maintain the loan and prevent a liquidation. This would be a great way to refinance and leverage my digital assets without creating a taxable event like I would if I had sold my assets.

Can I trust my neighbor on nextdoor.com to accompany me to an upper endoscopy if it’ll save me money?,"Hi guys,

This post is very last minute and I would be extremely grateful for some quick advice.

I have an upper endoscopy scheduled tomorrow, and they require a responsible person to accompany me to the procedure and take me home because I’ll be put under anesthesia. Unfortunately, I recently moved to a new state so I have absolutely no one I personally know who can take me.

As a result, I was forced to book a transportation service which will cost me $105 if I follow through. However, I’m seriously struggling financially and risk medical bills going into collections by paying for this service. As a last ditch effort tonight, (among other things) I made a post on nextdoor.com, asking if anyone within my immediate neighborhood could accompany me instead.

To my surprise, I got a reply from someone who was able to do it for free. Thus, if I cancel my appointment with the transportation service (only paying a $20 cancellation fee) and go with this person, I’ll save $85! But on the otherhand, I fear that, despite being within my neighborhood, I still don’t know and thus can’t trust this person.

On his profile, his full name is listed and he has a post history of about 6 years. Furthermore, I DMed someone else who replied to my post on nextdoor.com, and they vouched for the guy, saying he’s been living across the street from him for 20+ years and he is very reliable and trustworthy. But at the same time, the original replier doesn’t provide his specific address or too much personal info and is in 0 public groups.

I owe a bs insurance claim against me,"Back in April 1st of this year I got into a car accident where I failed to yield on a turn and due to that I hit another vehicle but they only literally got their corner of their bumper bent. Nothing else. Car still ran too, unlike mine. Lady was super chill about even saying “it’s fine, I just won’t risk driving home” due to the bumper scraping on her front left tire. Anyways, I was at fault and have an insurance claim of $7.8k being billed to me. I’m completely oblivious as to what I can do because I am not paying that amount for the sorry ass damages. I unfortunately panicked due to it being my first accident and i didn’t take any pictures of my car or the other. Am I just fucked?

Is it ever a good idea to refinance an auto loan?,"I currently have a 2018 Jeep Renegade with low miles (35kish) and have about $3,000 equity according to KBB.

I owe $19k on my loan with 3% interest rate that will be paid off in 3 years.

My dilemma is that my payment is higher than I would like it to be. It's doable in terms of being able to make the payment, but at this time in life, I would prefer to not have that much money going towards a car payment every month. It's definitely pushing it budget wise. Plus I would like to be able to put more money into savings every month. 

With the price of new and used cars, I feel that I would be overpaying for another vehicle and I don't want to get into a situation where I downgrade my current vehicle and finance more money total on another car. 

Would it be reasonable to refinance my current loan for 5 years that way I can keep my car but lower my current payment? Or is it better to just suck up the bigger payment and get it paid off in 3 years? Is there any other negative to refinancing other than extending the payoff time?

Thanks for your thoughts",0,1637033727,204,1064

Help! I was gifted cash to help with down payment on a house and need to deposit it without Uncle Sam getting involved.,"Hi everyone!
I’m in a bit of a pickle. I was gifted 33K in cash from a family member to assist in the down payment of purchasing a house. I should probably start by telling the reader that I myself am in debt, so I will be giving this money to my partner but in accordance to *The Law* I need to deposit said cash into a savings account, then transfer the money to my partner via wire transfer as to create a paper trail. 
However, anything deposited above $9,999USD at one time is automatically flagged to the IRS (Internal Revenue Services); if there are multiple transactions above $5-7k in a one month period of time, the account is automatically flagged. In either case, I will need to explain where this money came from and likely pay taxes on the gift.
I’m not being dramatic when I say, I really can’t afford that.
Does anyone here know how I could get around this? I’m really desperate. Should I set up an LLC and say it’s seed money and transfer it to myself? I don’t know what to do and I know time is running out. 
Please help.

Help deciding 401k next year,"Hello, my company 401k match is 6% @ 100% and I am thinking of my 6% being all Roth from now on, to make it so when I retire approximately 50/50 is Roth and Trad in 401k. Here are my current retirement account balances for me, and will be 23.5 exactly starting January 1st.


Account balances are as of today
401k is 13228.08
40% US Lrg Cap Equity Index Fund
48% US Sm/Md Cap Equity Index Fund
2% International Equity Index Fund
10% Company Stock (open to removing this)

HSA
5600 + a 500 non-investable buffer
60% VIGIX
40% VEMPX

I know this is the best retirement account, but I need to pay medical bills with it too because of major health conditions for myself and wife. We save as much of it as we can reasonably afford too.

Roth IRA.
$200 currently.

My household is just my income. Current salary is 84,975, paid 2 times monthly, so 24 paychecks. February 1st I will get a raise between 6 and 8%, I have 0 doubts I'm getting it, pretty sure the 8% but 6% is the minimum I'm going to get. My bonus in February 1st is going to be between 6k and 10k, probably about 9k, but for sure at least 6k. 
Between bonus and raise in total best case scenario I make just about 101k I believe for next year. 

My company will put 1100 into my HSA per year, but maxing it out is my #1 priority, then taking full advantage of the company match. That is what I did this year, my first year working all year in my career, and will do next year too. 

Only debt I have is a 3700 credit card which is 0% interest until June, will be paid off by then easily. Plus 20,600 in fed student loans which I will be paying about 300/month towards and a car payment of 411 per month with 0% interest. 

I want to buy a house in the next 3-4 years at most, and need to save up for a down payment.

I am putting 100% of my bonus to my emergency fund because I had an emergency this year (sort of. Credit card company for a 0% interest ""lost"" my autopay so 4k in credit card debt became due immediately, so that took half of my emergency fund. I've lost motivation to refund it from that but a 10k bonus will get it perfectly to the 6 month mark). I have no fear of losing my income at all, in fact my boss is promoting me as fast as possible, faster than HR policies allow and doubling the allowed raise percentages, he absolutely loves me so as long as I keep trying I have no shot at losing income. It's one of the biggest companies on earth so it isn't going anywhere either.

But back to my main question. I want to make my 6% of 401k contribution be all Roth. How much extra taxes am I looking at next year from making it Roth vs Trad? I live in AZ.",0,1637032793,503,2631
Home equity loan,"Hi folks. We bought our house for $625k in Austin this past January. We want to modernize the house so we plan to remodel. Our plan is to stay here in the long run so we did a lot of research to fund our remodeling projects. We looked at refinancing for cash out, helocs, home equity loan and decided that home equity loan is the best option for us right now. We have a 538k mortgage left on our house and applied for a home equity loan of $100k with a credit union at an interest rate is 3.2%. We have a good credit score of 800. 

The lender got back informing us that the home value using their automated valuation model is 591k and they cannot approve the home equity unless we pay for an appraisal.

When we bought our house in January, our home appraisal value was $665k and our Redfin/Zillow estimate is $900k now. Our neighbors sold their house around this price just last week for a similar square footage.

My concern is this lender wants us to pay $800 for an appraisal and I am now starting to doubt if the appraisal will even be close to $900k. Can we hire our own appraiser? Should we just pay and see what happens?Thoughts?",0,1637032584,214,1138

Insurance Coverage for Austim Treatment,"My wife and I are trying to decide which of us will cover the kids Healthcare for 2022. My insurance has a high deductible OOP max, but very low premium, wife's has higher premiums but lower ded and OOP. Her insurance has autism services listed as covered, mine says that's an exclusion. Our son (2y4m) is not diagnosed, but he's in speech and occupational therapy (MO first steps, that we decided to pay for out of pocket) and we're pretty sure he's autistic. My question is about Mo. Rev. Stat. § 376.1224.

""(2010) requires all group health benefit plans to provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. Coverage is limited to medically necessary treatment that is ordered by the insured’s treating physician or psychologist in accordance with a treatment plan. Treatment for autism spectrum disorder is defined to include psychiatric, psychological, habilitative or rehabilitative care, applied behavior analysis, therapeutic care and pharmacy care. Coverage for applied behavior analysis is subject to a maximum benefit of $40,000 per year for individuals through 18 years of age. However, this limit may be exceeded, with approval by the health benefit plan, if the applied behavior analysis services are medically necessary for an individual. The health benefit plan may not place limits on the number of visits an individual makes to an autism service provider.""

I'm probably wrong, but the way I interpret this is my provider can't legally exclude all coverage for autism related services. Am I wrong?  I don't know what services are available, or how much they cost, just trying to think things through financially. We decided MOFS wasn't too much to cover out of pocket, but the program only lasts until he's 3, then he might be able to go to a school.

"Need a second car. Buy, finance or lease in the current market (2021)?","Hi,

My wife and I are buying a house so we need to buy a second car (both of us will drive to work). Living in CT (snow in winter, etc.), the plan is to buy a AWD car, most likely a compact SUV (something like a Toyota Rav4 or Honda HR-V). We don't care about cars and are looking for something reliable. We intent to keep the car as long as possible (or switch if repair costs become prohibitive).

My initial idea was to buy outright a 2 to 5-year old car to get the best value out of it but after looking at the price of used cars in this market, I'm starting to wonder if this is the best approach from a financial standpoint.

prices of used cars are through the roof right now so I'm wondering if buying new could make more sense? I've always bought used cars before to benefit from the first few years of depreciation but I'm not sure this strategy still holds in this market?

If I were to buy a new car, would financing it make sense? I can afford to buy it outright but with car loans at \~1.9%, I feel like I could probably arbitrage that with better investments (therefore pocketing the yield differential).

Alternatively, I could lease the car for \~3 years, hoping that I can then purchase a used car for a more decent price by 2024. This solution still seems more expensive though.

So, in the current market, what would you do? Buy cash, finance or lease?

Can Collections Ding Your Credit,"Hi all,

I am in a bit of a tight situation. I sold a game console through Facebook marketplace by meeting up with the buyer in person. The guy asked me to pay through PayPal family and friends, and after doing some research on it, it seemed legit, so I accepted. Everything was fine, the guy rated me positively, I was able to deposit his payment to my bank account, until a month or so later when PayPal says there's been a dispute on the buyer's charge, as he reported it as suspicious, and now it's in review and they're withholding the funds. I provided them the evidence of the sale including chats saying when and where to meet up, with the buyer thanking me and rating me afterwards. But for some inexplicable reason, PayPal still ruled against me. Furious, I haven't paid the money back and PayPal says I can't appeal anymore as the charge was ruled as suspicious activity from the buyer's bank and that I'm out of options other than contacting my local police department/small claims court. Now, a collections agency called ACI (American Coradius International LLC) is attempting to collect the debt and is offering me to pay less than what the buyer scammed me out of. I'm trying my best to not get taken advantage of, but I'm worried about ACI dinging my credit. So I ask, if I don't pay the money back, is PayPal and ACI able to ding my credit? And does anyone have any tips on how to proceed? Thank you so much!

Questions about credit cards.,"I've had a credit card for about 10 years.  I never carry a balance.  Everything gets paid at the end of the month.  I've been using it more and more to pay pretty much everything.  Is it a good idea to pay everything with a credit card? Or should it be used for some things, and use a checking account for things like monthly utility bills, etc?

HELOC for (second) investment property,"Hello all,

Thinking about buying a second investment property (single-family home) for long-term rental. The goal is to have $200+ cash flow after mortgage(inc tax and insurance) and 10% buffer for misc expenses. We are prequalified for up to $700K; but all our funds towards downpayment would have to come from our stock and crypto investments. Since these have appreciated immensely in the last year, we will be hit by short-term cap gains if we sell some now. We have a primary residence ($300K equity built-up) and investment property for long-term rental ($400K equity built up). I am considering getting a HELOC from one of these properties to pay for a downpayment for the second investment property.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of questions:

1. Which property makes more sense for HELOC? Primary residence or investment property? I think I heard banks are more relaxed on primary residence...
2. Would banks object to bringing downpayment from a HELOC? (or would it help if I heloc with the same bank that I would apply for a mortgage?)
3. Can I buy a property outright with HELOC and then refi the property to pay back HELOC? has anyone done that?

Washington 529 Programs - GET vs Dream Ahead,"Washington offers two 529 programs. 

One is a credit system where I can purchase credits that are guaranteed to keep pace with the cost of instate tuition. The program is designed so that purchasing 100 credits is equal to a full year of in state tuition. Currently 1 credit is $114.03 so a full year is $11,403. My child would not need to attend a college in state, but the funds on deposit when they are ready to use them would be equal to the cost of tuition at an instate university.

The other system is standard 529 program which offers standard investment vehicles including Vanguard funds. The state of WA does not have an income tax so there are not tax benefits from sticking local but both options seem to be decent plans with minimal fees. 

Up to this point I have been contributing to a Roth IRA as a flexible retirement/college plan. I recently received a call from a relative who wishes to gift my child some funds which for their purposes needs to be deposited into a 529 plan.

Initially I was considering the guaranteed return of the GET program. The gift amount would guarantee more than a full year of tuition which is fantastic to have in the bank. However I pulled up the previous 10 years of tuition for the University of Washington and Tuition has been essentially flat. In 2011 tuition was $10,574 and in 2020 it was $11,745. Comparing that to the potential gains to be had in something like VTI I am now leaning toward the traditional 529 plan.

I feel like I am betting that the stock market will out grow tuition essentially. Has anyone else looked at these programs and can offer anything I am missing between the two?",0,1637026718,296,1649

Additional options for retirement investing,"Hello r/personalfinance! Seeking some input for retirement investing.

Married, file jointly, my wife and I both contribute to employer 401Ks to maximize their matching contribution. We previously opened Roth IRAs and have contributed the annual maximums for the past 15 years. Several years ago we exceeded the income limits for contributing to Roth. Since then we've used annual backdoor Roth conversions (put post-tax money in traditional IRA, convert the full amount to Roth) to continue to grow our Roth IRAs.

Roth conversions come with a tax hit. As I understand it, we pay tax on the full amount converted even though the Traditional IRA was funded with post-tax earnings. We're not in the top tax bracket, but we're pretty close. 

The last couple years I've been contemplating if continuing the backdoor Roth conversions are the best option for funding retirement. We both have 20 years left before we retire. Based on current tax brackets, we'd likely be in a slightly lower tax bracket in retirement.

As I see it, the other options we have are (1) just use a traditional IRA (but no tax deduction because of employer 401K contributions and income limits), (2) invest in a lifetime insurance annuity, or (3) put the money into a brokerage account and directly invest in stocks and/or mutual funds. Anything else I'm missing?

Based on those facts, what is our best option for continuing to invest to grow our retirement? Please let me know if you need more details or information.",0,1637026560,245,1492

Personal Loan Online Lender or My Bank?,"Hey folks,

I'm in need of a \~$20K personal loan and been shopping around the last week or so.

I searched on credit karma recommendations and based on the reviews found out that upstart looks to be a better option as an online lender. So I got a quote (soft pull) and was qualified for a 60 month term at 5.86% no origination fee and no repayment fee. I have a pretty good credit score in the 790s range and am pretty sure I can pay this off in less than 24 months.

I called up several local credit unions as well and their APRs weren't even close to this one with the best one at 36 months and 7.99% APR. So I assume that's automatically off the table.

My question is would it be worth to consider getting a loan from my bank (chase) assuming the APR may be higher? My thesis is even though I might get a slightly higher APR (again I'll pay this off in less than two years) it will help me have a better relationship with the bank in terms of paying off debt, getting higher credit card limits (have three CCs with chase), getting loans/mortgages in the future etc. on top of building my credit score in the long run?

Free Wire Transfers From Fidelity?,"Free Wire Transfers From Fidelity?

**TL;DR Will Fidelity send wire transfers for free from their settlement fund to a crypto exchange?**

There is a post over in r/gemini (crypto exchange) saying that Fidelity has free wire transfers. Is that right? I know that ACH is not a problem even if your bank were to charge you as long as the transfer is initiated from the brokerage house.

This is the thread

[Someone explain why a wire transfer is necessary to verify my bank account.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Gemini/comments/qu56ag/someone_explain_why_a_wire_transfer_is_necessary/)

porcupine73 1 point 12 hours ago Fidelity has free wire transfers.

Really? I have a Fidelity brokerage account. No checking, savings or anything else. Can I ACH money from my bank to Fidelity where it will sit in a settlement fund or money market fund. And then I can instead of telling Fidelity that I want to buy equity or an ETF or a target fund I can tell them to wire the money to a crypto exchange and they will happily oblige without charging me a wire transfer fee?

Pay down my mortgage or invest in the stock market?,"Hi everyone. I’m just looking for some advice on where the best place to put my money is right now. I’m working multiple jobs and finally have some cash to spare. My question is, should I pay down my mortgage (3.65% interest rate until 2036) or invest the spare cash in the stock market? I’ve been doing quite well with stocks recently (via the Stash app), but I’m still learning. 

The reason I’m leaning towards putting it into my mortgage is that I can be debt free sooner, and my principal:interest ratio will increase in each monthly payment the more I pay off.

Is it as simple as the stock market would have to make me more than 3.65% in a year to be a better option than paying down my mortgage?

How to calculate Average credit card interest?,"Hello Folks,

Card no.2 has APR of 15.99%

Card no.3 has APR of 23.99%

 and so on.

What is the average interest that I'll be paying? Is it even possible to calculate this?  


The reason I am asking is I am looking at Credit card debt consolidation and for that I am planning to take a loan.  So, I would like to know if it will be worth taking  one or not.

Eg: Let's say I secure a loan at  17% interest rate but the average interest of all credit cards is 15% , so in this case, it won't make sense to take a loan but instead continue to directly payoff Credit Cards.

temporary financing options for home purchase,"I am moving to a different country (and continent, Europe) - the real estate market is soaring there (as everywhere) and supply of houses is really low.

At the moment, I do not have a Euro income and am considered a tax foreigner (even though I have an EU citizenship). I own a house in the US with ~600k equity in it, I have other financial assets, but many of them are very illiquid (not yet vested participation schemes and therefore also difficult to value at market price, pension account), and my liquid financial assets are ~450k (Stocks, Cash, Crypto). Fixed net income ~200K/year, not counting potential bonus.

The house I want to buy costs 1.4M Euro. Side costs to buy are ~10%, so ~1.55M in total. 1 M mortgage costs roughly 3600/month - so I am not really concerned about the price.

The bank appraised for 1.1M only, I asked them why and they say they use average transaction data of the last 10 years (which obviously are very different to the current market prices). They will only mortgage for 80% of that appraised value (which is apparently a legal requirement). Other banks didn’t even want to give any loan without a Euro income/being a tax foreigner.

I would really hope to buy now as a) I need to register my kids for school in January and therefore need “the place” we will live at. Also, I have been chasing that market for almost a year and prices are increasing at an accelerating pace (would say ~20% this year). given the yield environment, buying still is cheaper than renting (rents have increased as well) by a wide margin.

The bottom line is:
1.55M
-1.1M x 0.8 = 880K
= 670 K Euro = 765K Usd

Even if I sell all my liquid assets (which tax-wise is also bad), i am still short 315K, I would have enough if I could access my current home equity (quickly). The problem there is - given the current market conditions, I can’t refinance (takes too long and also seems silly if I am going to sell in 3-6 months). Heloc also takes too long from what I understand.

Does anyone have an idea what else I could do? I am thinking to ask about a personal unsecured loan here in the US, the same in Europe, but other than asking family I cant think of any other options…",0,1637023008,395,2193
How to avoid extra taxes on a backdoor Roth IRA conversion,"I've been looking into the Roth IRA backdoor and heard about the pro-rata rule. [This article explains the rule more](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/backdoor-roth-ira), but to summarize, if you have multiple types of IRA accounts and any of that money was a pre-tax contribution, then you end up having to pay some income tax on the money you convert.

I do have a SEP-IRA account, although it's a relatively small amount of pre-tax money. Like under $6000. Even so, I'm not too excited about the idea of paying ""double"" income tax on any portion of the backdoor conversion and was wondering if there's any way to get around that.

Should I convert my existing SEP-IRA balance into the Roth IRA and just ""bite the bullet"" on the penalties for doing that? Or maybe it's financially better to just leave it and pay the double income tax?",0,1637022677,140,849

I know you want to park money in safe vehicles (i.e. HYSA) for a near term down payment but part of me wants to allocate more into total market ETFs (i.e. VTI) to potentially gain more and hedge against inflation. 3 years is sort of on the line so that's why I'm hesitant. For perspective, I can save over $3k/month after expenses, max out 401k and “wants”. Was thinking of splitting it $2000/$1000 to HYSA and Brokerage account respectively. I currently have about $20k in assets already, about half of that parked in a HYSA and the rest in VTI and various stocks.

Banking Overseas,"Hey PF peeps - Partner and I are looking at relocating overseas in the next few years. I'll provide a bit of context for the situation and just seeing if folks here have any advice. And it relates specifically to banking / investments as a US citizen living in Europe.  


We currently live in the US, are both US citizens and no secondary citizenship. We're hoping to relocate to Denmark for work, and will find out in the coming weeks/months if that's possible. Barring that, we plan on relocating ourselves to Spain and potentially taking a year or two off while we recover from 25 years with no real breaks from the working rat race and figure out next steps.   


We've been able to research and discuss most aspects of what either situation would look like, except figuring out a clear answer to banking appears to be challenging.   


Most of our accounts are at either a credit union (yeah, that won't work) or an investment bank (might work, but probably not).  


So far, the best options we've found are things like HSBC (varying levels like Premier etc) that has good international coverage, Chase, Citi, Capital One that are functional, but not clear on how well they really work if you're living overseas (we can use a family member's address in the states for anything critical but we'd rather not). 

Anyway, would love any feedback / ideas folks have on how to approach both banking while transitioning to immigrate to Europe from the US, or best ways to handle things once there. Local bank? Stick with a larger international? Etc. We wouldn't plan on returning to the US very often, except perhaps to visit my one sibling, and we are... moderately well off and would prefer to keep most of our money in an investment bank.

Hopefully that's enough detail to help provide some guidance or ideas from folks who've either already done this or like us, are in process of figuring it out themselves. 

I plan to write up a guide on this crap once I know my a$$ from a while in the ground WRT to international banking situations. But right now, I'm still simply trying to figure out what resources there are and how to reason about it.",0,1637020821,385,2148
/r/personalfinance convinced me to sell my 2021 Jeep. What next?,"In a post a few weeks back everyone on this sub was explaining the benefits of NOT owning a luxury vehicle and to just rent one if you ever want the experience, etc. It convinced me to sell the 2021 Jeep Wrangler I bought in March. 

Numbers: 

Paid: $46,000

Other costs: $2726.58 tavt

Carvana Offer: $47,298

I'd be making a bit of money on the car, technically. But the tax, tags, title I paid would be a loss. The way I'm seeing that is I paid $500/month to drive the jeep rather than seeing that as lost money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I won't really be making money on the car, will I have to pay taxes on it if I just sell it? Carvana is saying something about ""save $3000 on sales tax if you trade in vs. sell"" but everything I find online says if there is no profit, I don't pay capital gains tax and I don't see what ""sales tax"" I would have to pay.

Is investing exclusively in Berkshire Hathaway a risky decision?,"So I am quite young and currently put aside roughly 200 dollars every month for a mortgage. The government in my country add 25% to whatever I contribute so it’s better than a normal bank savings account. The catch is that it can only be spent on a mortgage in my own country and I am not 100% sure I will be buying a property here.

So instead of this I was thinking of increasing what I put aside and buying one share of BRK-B per month. I was thinking this negates the risk of a market crash and also allows me to dollar cost average down if a crash occurs.

My only reservation is that all my eggs are in one basket, or is the diversification that BRK-B already provides enough to negate this risk. I personally do not feel financially literate enough to make long term, 20 years or so, investments. I also thought this would allow me more flexibility to cash out my shares and buy a property wherever I end up.",0,1637020424,173,915

My wife just received a small inheritance. How can we best use it?,"My wife’s mother passed away over the summer and we unexpectedly received a $10,000 inheritance today. We are trying to figure out how to best utilize the money. Our first impulse is to pay off credit cards. If we put 100% of the $10,000 toward credit cards, that would wipe out virtually all of our credit card debt and free up about $650-$700 per month in credit card payments. Before we do that, is there anything else we should be looking at doing? We have a car payment and a mortgage payment but far lower interest rates. We have nothing urgent that we need to do to the house. We could also put it in savings but that doesn’t seem like it should be a huge priority.

I pay $1250 per month for 2 kids in daycare, average for the area. I don’t qualify for financial assistance because I make $10k too much per year. Child support barely covers half of that amount and leaves nothing for a living expenses.

I pay $1300 per month to rent a 3 bedroom apartment, one of the cheapest in the area and it doesn’t include utilities. 2 bedrooms is only $100 less and I have a boy and a girl so by law they have to be in separate rooms at some undefined point.

The way it is set up is that I will receive $30,000 every December for the next ~8 years. I am 28, live in the US and this is my current financial situation:
-	$70k salary (as of this month)
-	Car paid off
-	No student loans
-	No debt 
-	I live with my partner and we split all the bills, but overall I spend about $2k a month on necessities (mortgage, utilities, insurance, groceries, etc.) 
-	I only have about $4k in savings at the moment. I know I need to build this up more. Now that my salary has gone up a little, this should be easier to build up more. 
-	I’m currently putting about $280 a month in my 401k and it has about $16k in it total. 

Here are my main concerns/questions:
1.	How much money should I be putting into my savings per paycheck? 
2.	Should I be adding more into my 401k? 
3.	I need to get a car that has 4WD or AWD, as it gets really snowy where I live, and my car just isn’t cutting it in the winter. My plan is to keep my current car to commute to work when it isn’t snowy (it has good gas mileage) and trade in my partner’s car to get an SUV. My thoughts are to buy a gently used car with the money I get this year but I don’t know if that’s the best route to go or not. 
4.	As for the $30k  (other than possibly buying a car) - I want to invest it but I don’t even know where to start or what my options are. I might keep a little bit of it in my savings every year to build it up more but I don’t know what kind of account to put it in or anything.

Either way, I'm seeing $20k being added to my already large student loan debt. I'm being told this is a recapitalization due to me missing loan payments when my deferments ended.  It was two loan payment I missed (if I was understanding correctly) due to not making enough money to pay it and forgetting to call them to extend my deferment...or forbearance? I don't remember which is which.  Anyway, I called the loan collection once I realized what was going on and fixed it shortly after getting the overdue notice.

Regardless, I got hit with the recap.  A big recap.  

I was told by the company it was the department of education's ""rule"" that they can't undo it.  Is this true? Is there really no way I can get out of this trap?  It was basically an undergrad degree, a useless one.  My parents are immigrants and they didn't really understand how college works.  I basically ended up getting a useless degree and had to go back to college (out of pocket) to get a useful certification.  

Now that I have a job that pays a living wage, I know they're going to ask me to start repaying the loans.  The thing is, the recapitalization ended up being almost 50% of my total loans.  It seems like a trap I was put into, and I feel like a second chance shouldn't be impossible.

Am I understanding recapitalization correctly? The collection agency is telling me there is nothing they can do, but would I be able to contact the department of education directly and see if they can help me?  Do I need a lawyer?  Seems like hiring a lawyer would be cheaper than paying 20k.

I'm 33 and just found out that I should have started an IRA ages ago. I have about 10k CC  (now consolidated into a personal loan) debt that I am gradually paying off. I've been told that it's best if I start an IRA ASAP, but also been told to max it out. I can't afford pay off my debt AND max out my IRA.   


Should I wait until I pay off my debt to open an IRA and focus on maxing it out?

How to use credit to earn your income,"Im 36.  I always had a great credit 800+.  I have little debt under 5k.

"How do you go about taxes when investing in Index funds, specifically Capital Gains despite not selling anything.","I'm new to investing but I went the simple route for now by investing in index funds. 80% in FZROX and 20% in FZILX in a personal brokerage account, not a 401k or IRA. I don't plan on selling those soon, maybe in the next 5-10 years. I'm using Fidelity and I'm slightly ignorant to what I'm looking at when I'm looking at information on these funds. 

There's a tab listing dividends which I assume is the historic payout of dividends from companies within the index fund being paid out to investors for a given year. Next to it is reinvestment price which I'm slightly confused on. Is that the value of the index during the time those dividends were being given? I'm also confused on what the capital gains tab is supposed to be. I was the under the assumption that capital gains is something I would have if I sold a fund/stock/etc at a profit. Does mutual fund capital gains come from money made from stocks being sold from the index and being passed to every person investing in the fund? How does taxes work for that? I was assuming I could just keep away from the taxes with investing as long as I never realize any gains or losses by selling anytime soon.",0,1637016585,216,1162

Rookie mistake? Crashed my credit score,"Might be a cautionary tale for someone, but I really did not see this coming.

I've been steadily building up my credit score, paying off car, all the cards, never going above 10% utilization, etc. This fall I was shopping for a phone and instead of paying full price, I decided to play the game of making monthly payments and get some credit points in the long run. Bought the phone from Google with their advertised ""24 months, 0% APR"", which actually is an account with Synchrony.

Before all this, I had a score of 769, got approved for the loan, dipped to 760, that's expected and fine. The first statement came in, I paid it off, but this morning when I checked credit karma, it crashed to 745, because this ""loan"" shows up as yet another credit card :(. The purchase was $1300, credit limit $2000, so I ended up with ~64% ""Card"" utilization. 

Hindsight is 20/20, but if you've got a credit limit on your account, it's a credit line, not a loan, lol. I guess I'll just pay it all off immediately and spend another year recovering my score.",0,1637016430,190,1046

"In order to be 100% certain you will get a ""fair"" raise, you need another offer (in writing) and the willingness to walk.","In light of inflation and job market, I am seeing tons of posts discussing how to ask for a raise, how much they should ask for and what they should say to their bosses when they inevitably hear ""its not in our budget"" or some other excuse/reason why they won't pay you more. 

There is only one way to ensure you will get a raise and it will align with the current market rate for your position. 

Go on the market, get an offer from another company and be ready to walk if you have to. It truly is that simple. 

If you come to the table with this leverage, all of your bosses excuses and reasons why they can't give you a raise are meaningless to you. 

If they want you, they will retain you. If they don't, in theory, your boss should be professional, wish you luck and you should move on.

They are a business and will cut ties with you whenever they need to in order to benefit themselves. Why should you act any differently?

People seem scared to do this as it actually puts some pressure on employers to come to the table. Without having another offer, you could be leaving massive amount of money on the table even if you do get a raise.",0,1637016164,218,1148
"What ""money"" do you use when buying in a dip?","I was thinking the other day, when a market crashes, a valid and sound strategy for the long-term investor is to simply buy more of everything and think of the crash as a ""XX% sale, everything must go!""

Newborn and looking for first house. Any advice,"Hello me and my spouse just had a newborn and we think it is time for us to start looking for our first house. We was looking for advice on how much should we be spending for a house and which type of loan to use. 

During the pregnancy, we brought in around 180k, but my spouse will be dropping down to part time for child care bringing us to around 150k. Should we be looking for a house with so many changes going on? Our lease ends in March and we was thinking we should start looking now in case something pops up and we don’t want to miss out on an opportunity. On top of that, we don’t know if our landlord will either increase our rent due to having a baby here or because of inflation and we don’t want to sign a new lease for a whole year. Plus we would like another bedroom as a guest room so family can help with the child when needed. 

We have an emergency fund and can put down 20% if pmi is outrageously expensive. Only debt we have is 30k in federal student loans at 4% and less. Monthly expenses range between 3-4K prior to baby.  My only concern is what our budget will be now with the newborn. Also will we get a better rate now since we are both full time compared to looking when my spouse goes part time?

Feeling extremely behind,"Hello everyone,

Although I am (30) far ahead of the average networth for my age bracket, I feel I as I am extremely behind on retirement investment. I just got divorced and one out problems was that I thought a lot about retiring early and comfortable and the partner did not.

Let me throw some numbers so it is better to understand my current situation and why I am above net worth average for my age but behind for retirement savings.

Low cost of living
Income net: 55k
- 1099 income so no 401k
Home equity: $90,000
Foreign country investment real estate: $100,000
- this is generating 10%/year of ROE
- all the generated income is reinvested in the foreign country bonds (most attractive investment due to high inflation)
- Savings: $20,000 emergency fund
- I am finishing my bachelors degree this semester (Business and IT) * I know it is late
- No debt (paid school with my hard earned money)
- Roth ira: $1500 (yes, very low but just started) 
- other investments: $15k

Total networth: ~$225,000

Occurrences of Loosing money,"Hello, 
I’m writing this because I want to improve my current circumstances. It could be about finances, or about discipline. I’m not sure, please if you can shed some lights. 

From past two years, I have recurring incidents of loosing money. 
For example: 
incident#1: I took my daughter to the hospital, we did the check up. since the doctor said I have one month to provide insurance details. So I thought when the new job starts, she will be under me, so it will be covered. When I started my new job, insurance people mentioned, I started job on 23rd, and you have been to the hospital on 20th. So it can’t be covered. I have to pay $360 out of pocket. 

Incident#2: I travelled out of state for the first time, I had no idea about tolls, I took no tolls booth, which turned out to be fastest lane. So I got a bill of $290(sum of all tolls) 

Incident#3: I rented a room for a temporary stay and paid deposit(advance) to the owner. He told me to stay in his basement for two weeks, then the room will be available. But after two weeks, he didn’t shift me to the room. When I wanted to move(for some other reason), he said you didn’t give me notice. I won’t return your $350 deposit. So I lost $350. 

Another latest incident: I lost $245 in an exam, that I was suppose to prepare, but I didn’t because of personal reason I didn’t get a chance to prepare. So I lost the fee, since they cannot refund me back. 

Going through all these financial incidence has caused me a lot of stress and financial burden. I feel like I could’ve avoided this. I feel like I am doing something or not doing something that I am suppose to. 

Am I not paying attention to details? Or is this pretty normal life experiences that people go through and you just learn from it and move on? 

I know there will not be a straight answers for these scenarios, as they all are different scenarios. But my question is: is there anything I can do to prevent or at least minimize these kind of losses. 

Any guidance is helpful. Thanks.",0,1637014731,377,2011
Should I apply home mortgage jointly or solo,"Me and my spouse planing to buy our first home. We are in MA

Lender is asking whether we want to apply for the mortgage jointly or solo. Me and my wife has excellent credits. I have a good income but my wife is a freelancer. She does not have a larger income.

Should I wait to buy a home in this market as a single 31 year old?,"To set the stage, I'm looking into purchasing a property not because I feel like I need to buy a home to live in, but because I'm worried I'll financially regret the decision of not buying now.

Some additional context:
* 31 years old
* single
* self-employed tech worker
* work remotely
* reliably grossing 200k+ yearly through C2C contract work
* didn't grow up with money (I would consider myself to have relatively now financial literacy)
* so far, only invest in stocks (I put about $900/month into a betterment account starting in the last year)
* somewhat low savings
* military veteran (I have access to the VA home loan)
* first-time home-buyer
* I spend about 5k between my penthouse apartment and luxury car lease. 

I don't intend for that last bullet to come off as though I'm bragging; it's just that I've worked hard to be able to afford my current lifestyle and it brings me joy. 

I'm reaching an age where the future seems more ""real"". Basically, I'm realizing I need to plan for retirement, and putting money into property is obviously a large (if not the largest) part of the equation.

I'm looking at what's happening with inflation and low mortgage rates and how much real estate has gone up in the past couple of years and wondering if I'd be an idiot NOT to purchase property at the moment.

Personally, I wouldn't mind renting forever if I didn't think my older self would financially regret it. I'm not trying to build a nest egg for future generations; I'm not family-oriented, although that could change one day, who knows 🤷‍♂️.

Since I don't have a TON of savings, I would like to use the VA home loan to avoid having to put a lot of money down. Some preliminary research tells me I would qualify for up to $1 million but I feel like $500-600k is more comfortable/reasonable for me since I'm primarily looking at a property I would later rent out. Preferably an apartment in an urban area since I'm a city-dweller that likes to have things within walking distance and I don't want the hassle of maintaining a yard.

Is it prudent for someone in my position to wait until they actually WANT to purchase a certain piece of property, or is there really no time like the present, or is there no way to know?

Thanks for anyone taking the time to read this. 

I don't love waxing on about myself or my personal life in this way, but home-buying is such a huge decision and I'm realizing I don't have the right knowledge or the right people in my network to feel like I'm making the best decision I could. 

I'm in the process of trying to find a financial advisor/fiduciary, so any advice on how best to navigate that process as well would be appreciated.

Question about buying an empty lot before new home construction loan,"So I just completed the purchase of a lot for $130k before we finalize our construction loan since we’re still finalizing those plans.

The lot loan is for 1 year, and the plan is to combine the lot and construction loan into one at the end of the build.

"Need help paying CC debt, please","I need huge help reorganizing my financial life. I only have my dad and I don’t like to tell him when I am in trouble or desperate. He already is disappointed in me hahah. 

Anyways, I am 21 and have a lot of credit card debt. And I haven’t  paid anything at all on them in the last four months. It wasn’t my priority, since I have to sent out money, pay my rent, and other. So you can have an idea of how awful my credit score is ( 400s if lucky?).

Rent: $400
Car insurance: $290
Phone: 100
Mom: $100
Gym and media entertainment: ~$50
Gas: $150 (long commute to work)

Credit card debt (all of them are beyond credit limit because of the monthly fees and since I wasn’t paying for 4 months). Interests rates are 22-29%

Victorias Secret: $280
Target: $400
Amazon: $500
Journey Student: $630
Discover: $1600
Bank of America: $2250

Total of $5,660 on CC debt only. And 15k on student loans. And I owe a friend $500. I have no savings at all. 

How can I best approach start paying this debt? I admit I have no discipline at all. But any tip to start building it can really help me. I will try my best to educate myself as well, and reading more. But I just feel like I can’t get out of this debt but it’s worse every month that passes by without paying, of course. 

I had 2 ideas and I am not sure how good they are: 

1- Take out a personal loan with lower interest rate than the CC and consolidate everything. However, it will be hard to find a good interest rate since my credit score is really really really bad. 

2- Start using an envelope mechanism and withdraw all my money in cash every paycheck and divide it into the envelopes. 

All advice is appreciated, please be harsh if you fell the need to. This empty brain deserves it for getting in all this mess.

Question for mortgage lenders,"I have two options for sourcing my down payment for my home. One is a loan from my retirement.

Summer Programs are currently not considered ‘exchange’ programs, and thus we pay the exchange school diretcly and our current finanical aid package towards my state school cannot be used. Furthermore, when I reached out to the business/financing department about scholarships I was told they only offer them for those seeking a bachelors degree and that minors do not qualify. 


Does anyone have any advice on seeking outside scholarships/financing the program? Thank you!",0,1637012047,117,754
Car Trade in deal,"We currently finance a 2019 nissan sentra with 55000 miles. Got roped into a simple interest loan, and owe 12500 on it, payments are 340 a month, with around 50 payments left.
I  can currently trade this car in, and upgrade to a 2021 Nissan Rogue Sport with AWD, and have 2500 in trade in after paying off the Sentra loan

Estimated payments are the same, 60 month term

Is there benefit in getting out of the simple interest loan and going with traditional car loan? I would be motivated to pay this down faster if i can save on interest.

We would like to buy a home, around 1 year out as well.

Benefits i see.

Should I be putting taxed money in a Roth IRA?,"I'm 19, about to max my Roth IRA and I realized that most of the money I've been putting in it is money that I've already paid taxes on.

Should I only be putting non-taxed money into my Roth IRA and putting the rest that I've already paid taxes on into an individual brokerage?

Maybe I'm thinking about this all wrong. Previously I have wrote my IRA contributions off on my taxes. Am I only writing off taxed money and not writing off non-taxed money?

Need help deciding which offer to accept,"I am only 24 years old with 2 years of professional experience. After two months of job hunting after my last unsuccessful job change, I was offered two options right now.

Option 1: My old role at my previous established foreign company. The pay is $60k (which is a huge jump from my previous pay) and approximately $5k bonus each year. No probation period and full benefits package. My manager really likes working with me and he is willing to train me. The work environment is very chilled and no workload at all. All the coworkers (all a lot older than me) around me really like me as well, but career growth is limited. While I might able to get my manager's position when he leaves in two years, but the leadership level changed so frequently (due to all leaderships coming from another country on a rotation basis). I can probably work and get my MBA while working there.

Option 2: a fintech start-up offers me $65k and stock options (no bonus). They have full benefits package too. The environment is very fast-paced and probably changes every day. However, it is fully remote so I can save on transportation time. Everyone working there is super young. There will be a lot of chances for me to push for higher positions and learn a lot more. The area in which the fintech is operating is super hot right now. The start-up recently got Series A funding, so it is unlikely the firm would fail anytime soon.

A lot of my friends suggested I should go for option 2. While option 2 is really good for my future, the uncertainty with option 2 is very high. When I was interviewing with them, I realized my team is highly unorganized and possibly lacks professional advice. It seems I would have to build a program from ground zero, so it will be a lot of overtime. But option 1 is very chilled, and no overtime is guaranteed. So I am really divided here.

Early IRA withdrawal,"30 years old - I'm stuck in paycheck to paycheck hell and barely making my minimum payments on the entirely too much debt I hold. I've successfully held up all my accounts without defaulting for now, but once federal student loan repayments start back up, Im going to be in a world of hurt &amp; I have no idea what I'm going to do for the next emergency expense as it is. 

I have no general savings as I can only afford to save OR pay debt.  My 401k contributions can be described as minimal at best, but I do have about $29k in a rollover IRA and about $4500 in a Roth  IRA. 

I'm estimating about $15,000 after taxes and penalties if I were to withdraw those accounts to pay off debt and reduce my monthly payments.  This would allow me room to save, pay student loans and start over with higher 401k contributions.  I'd also like to move eventually/find a roommate to cut housing expenses as well, but can't do so as of now because I'm so indebted and can't afford moving expenses. 

I've already looked into debt management programs and they don't seem like they'll help enough and debt settlement program risks horrify me not to mention they don't seem like enough help as well.

Am I being reasonable? I understand I'd be losing the exponential growth with withdrawal, but if I can't afford to live and could save so much on interest payments isn't it worth it? Is my estimate of $15,000 after taxes in the right ball park? Any other advice?",0,1637010789,269,1449

Cancelling Whole Life Policy with NW Mutual,"Last year I began converting a term life insurance policy to cash value through Northwestern Mutual. The guy I was working with really pushed me on on about how great of an investment tool is since its guaranteed at least 4.8% returns and a great way to avoid capital gains tax as well. I see the logic in it, but I've always sort of felt uneasy about it. I have asked other successful people I know if they do it or recommend it and I can't remember anybody speaking highly of it.

At this point, I have paid almost $3k in premiums. If I were to cancel today, I'd get $450 back so out about $2550.

Grandma's going broke - How to finance her home and living expenses,"My grandma came to me recently and let me know that she is almost out of cash (has no other investments or money elsewhere).  She owns a co-op apartment in Manhattan and has no debt of any kinds.  This came as a shock to me, but now I have to help her come up with a plan as there is no one else in the family that is able or reliable enough to step in.  

Her co-op maintenance (that's building fees + property taxes) is $1700/mo, she spends about $800/mo, and receives about $500/mo in social security, so the net spend is about $2000/mo.  Her apartment would sell for $450k-$500k.

I'm in my early 30s and married (no kid yet, but one day) and my grandma is a healthy 75 year old living on her own without any help.  

I see two options: 

1) Place the apartment in a trust with me as the beneficiary (I'll have to consult a lawyer, need to protect it from Medicaid claims later on) and I entirely finance her life.  I could afford to do this, but it would be a significant expense that I'm not eager to take on.  This would divert my money from my own investments, but I'd ""own"" an apartment.  From a financial perspective, I'm pretty much betting on my grandma's longevity, which I hate to think about.  I'm also on the hook for any new expenses that come up, such as medical bills or assessments by the co-op (I think those have averaged her about $1000/yr over the past 30 years).

 2) Sell the apartment, she gifts me the money to manage for her (again, will consult a lawyer to deal with the legal and Medicaid issues), and I invest that money and draw from it to pay the rent on a new apartment and her bills.  Her having no assets will help with Medicaid and might help her get into a low cost senior housing program, but I know nothing about stuff yet.

If I went with option 2, I could really use advice on what to do with that money to generate income.  I'm not familiar with these types of portfolios, as my own investing is for my retirement decades from now.  I think I'd want to keep that bucket of money separate from my own, but I'm really not sure if it makes more sense to think of it as my money, and invest it based on my own time horizons, and just write monthly checks from my regular income for my grandma's bills. 

I would greatly appreciate any and all advice! Thank you all!!",0,1637010486,449,2306
"Have roughly 40k in a savings account, what do you recommend I move it to?","Just a bit of background, I am 29 and have 2 kids and make about 75k/yr. We mostly live paycheck to paycheck until my end of year bonus which is anywhere from 8-12k. Usually about half goes into a savings account, along with most of our tax refund. By the end of this year Im guessing I will have around 40-45k in a savings account. I also contribute 4% of my paycheck to a 401K and that should be close to 12-13k by the end of the year.

How do I make a student loan payment early and in full? Anything I should be aware of?,"Hi all, so when I started college I calculated the approximate amount of student loans I was going to have to pay back once I graduated. Because of this I made sure 70% of my paychecks from the jobs/fellowships/internships I had since then went towards my ""paying student loans savings account"". I recently graduated and am not entirely at my savings goal yet. I owe 10,500 and I've saved 7,000 so far.

However, my parents out of the blew told me that they may be able to pay the remainder off which I am so grateful for.

I was not expecting that offer but am going to take it (def plan on repaying them as soon as I can).

My first payment/ interests don't kick in till December 15th and then I think I have a forbearance because of the pandemic till January.

I'm just so confused as to how I make the payment. I made a small payment of 100$ to kind of get the gist. I'm scared all the money is going to pay off the interests first instead of the principle.

Would that even be an issue if I make the full payment before my interests rate/first payment kicks in? Also, will I receive a letter from my servicer saying that I have paid everything off once I do? Thanks!",0,1637009862,246,1317

Should I use my emergency fund to pay off my car?,"Hi everyone! 

I’d like to think I have grown in my sense of budget but I have this one dilemma. 

Long story short 3.5 years ago I desperately needed a car and accepted a loan from ally that I really shouldnt have 

The apr is 19% (which I now know is bad) and I still have 5300 on this loan. I have been making an extra 150 payment a month to help but it gets eaten up and theres no end game it seems. I dont have 5.3k now I have 2.4k in an emergency fund since I only started really getting serious about budgeting recently. 

I get an annual bonus in March which should be around 2.3k-3.5k before taxes (could be more but this is the first time I’m on the annual route not quarterly this is the first year in my non entry level job) 

I will also get my tax returns but I am not even certain what that will be I dont make an insane amount but I can survive on my own. 

I am going to use my bonus towards the debt. Should I break into my e.f. To pay it? By then I should be at 3.4 k maybe more if I dont spend too much personally. Should I take out another loan? Should I stop paying the $150 extra and just wait to pay lump at the time of my bonus?

Is it really that bad having REIT's in a brokerage account?,"Hi all,

I'm fairly new to investing and doing my own taxes as well honestly. Yesterday I put down $8k for 500 shares of an REIT that has a 9% yield. This is in my Schwab Brokerage account. At least for now, I plan on reinvesting all dividend profit and purchase more of this stock. 

I am/was looking for something safe, with high monthly dividend payments, and I guess something a little less boring and slightly higher rate of return than a mutual fund of bonds. 

Last night I was reading other Reddit posts and basically what I gathered is dividends count as ordinary income so is taxed really high and it only makes sense having REITs in an IRA or other tax-free account. 

I am confused though because don't you get a huge penalty if you take $ out of an IRA before age 60? I definitely don't see myself holding this REIT stock for 30 years....

What other type of investment vehicles would be better than a brokerage account for REITS? I am still pretty young so assume I want to take out this money at some point in the next 5 years or so. 

Essentially, is it really **that** bad having REITS in my brokerage account? Or do I just need to suck up the tax situation and its not really that bad having REITs in the brokerage account?

Check fraud and dealing with Bank of America,"Please help random internet strangers you're my only hope.

Credit Card Debt Payoff Plan,"Hi all,

I’m an upcoming grad and looking for help getting my finances in better order. At this point, my main concern is taking care of credit card debt while maintaining a decent savings, and I’m not sure what the best move is.

Card #1 has a balance of $4,445.50 (APR of \~23.74%) with a payment of (currently) $135/mo.

Card #2 has a balance of $2,266.80 (APR hasn’t kicked in yet, but I believe it will be 16% APR when it does) with a flat-rate payment of $236/mo. This is my most expensive monthly bill, but I want to pick up a car payment my dad is currently helping me with ($315/mo) once I have this paid off.

I have a savings of \~$8,500. I want to keep a reserve for rent because I don’t have an official job offer yet; at this point I’d rather not part with more than $2k, but I’d be willing to consider up to $3k.

My thought was to pay off Card #2 in full and put the money I was paying into that towards Card #1 (making a monthly of $371). Because I still want to at least help my dad with the car payment, I could instead go half with him and put the other half toward Card #1 (monthly of $253).

Is this a good course of action, or is Card #1 and its APR more urgent to deal with?",0,1637007085,233,1198
Insurance Company Negotiating in Bad Faith over Total Loss,"Hi,

Recently my car was deemed a total loss by my insurance company. So far they have, seemingly, intentionally omitted options that were clearly listed on VIN search websites any half-decent evaluator should reasonably be expected to have access to, and incorrectly listed a certain option as ""missing"" when they hadn't even done a cursory inspection of the vehicle yet. Spoiler: All options are present, in OE condition and operation, and are functional. 

Then when I called them to let them know I wouldn't stand for this egregious misjustice, they low-key tried to dissuade me from submitting examples of cars near-identical to mine going for significantly more money than what they're offering me by saying ""that *could* lead to the offer being significantly reduced"" but not explaining *why* it could reduce the offer. My bet is they'll ""find"" examples selling for less. I searched nationally on multiple popular sites and can only find cars selling for more, so I think they're bluffing. And the website has no easy way to submit URL's to example cars so they can verify my claims, anyway. It's almost like they really don't want me to do this.

Since our morning phone call the evaluation was updated to reflect the options my car has more properly, but they conveniently forgot to factor in my new car buying assistance option of +20%, which, of course, significantly reduced the overall offer. From what has been happening since the start of this process I'm half-inclined to believe this was intentional, but it also could have just been an oversight so I'm just going to let them know about it, not start a fight over it.

Anyway, I guess what I'd like to know is if their claim that submitting pricier examples of near-identical cars for sale holds any weight? And, even if it doesn't, is it really worth it to bother submitting those examples? Has anyone successfully done this and gained enough to make it worth the risk and effort? Lastly, do I have any grounds to contact legal representation if they continue to play games, or would that just be a waste of time and effort as well?

Thank you in advance!",0,1637007030,361,2124

Malpractice settlement with insurance liens,"This was originally posted in r/insurance but was advised to post here as well. 

My wife will be collecting a malpractice settlement soon.  After attorney fees she'll be looking at roughly $1MM (state max limit).  After her incident she is unable to work and has required ongoing medical care which our medical insurance has covered to the tune of over $1MM. What I have learned is that the insurance company is piggybacking onto her settlement and is requiring repayment of up to $800k. Plus her long term disability is requiring repayment of $86k.  We have hired a firm to negotiate the liens, but it sounds like the insurance company is not required to negotiate.  I'm at a loss here. My wife requires 24/7 care. Luckily, I work from home and have been able to keep up. It's frustrating that years of litigation will result in insurance companies getting paid and the victim left with no meaningful amount to help ease her situation.  Our attorney says in any other state the settlement would be $10MM, but my state is capped at $1.5MM.

Mortgage Refinance Timing,"Hoping this makes sense.

Credit score is mid-upper 700s.

Should I purchase the land before or after Refi? Does it matter?

If before refi I would get a new loan to purchase the land or take the money out of my 401k. Is one better than the other?

Should I take out Subsidized Student Loans?,"Hey!  


So I'm going back to school to get an additional bachelors degree online. I'll be working while doing this, which I'm not worried about as I've always been good at school. I've been offered some student loans, and it looks like I'll be able to cover the program with only subsidized federal loans (I'll also apply for some scholarships as I go, but I don't expect anything from them.)

I've been working for a few years, so if I wanted I could pay out of pocket for the program (in-state tuition is so so cheap). It would wreck my savings, but I could do it. I've been trying to run the numbers though and I honestly think with subsidized loans only I'll actually be better off taking them out and paying them off aggressively once I graduate. Like I think with inflation I'll end up paying less since they won't be accruing interest while I study.

I'm not looking for advice on whether I should get the degree, and also I want to say upfront that I'm very good with money and budgeting, so I know I'll have the money still once I graduate unless something incredible happens. And in that case I clearly needed it anyway so it's a good thing I had it.

Just looking for an outside perspective on taking out these loans. Does this plan seem to make sense? I'm scared of debt.

20 Year Old Without a Clue,"Hey guys, 

I'm currently in the process of figuring out what the hell I'm supposed to do with my money. I currently work two jobs while attending school. I am rather fortunate and had a lot of money provided for my schooling from family on top of some scholarships. This has left me with around $14,000 dollars in debt in my junior year, with another $6,000 coming next semester. Due to covid I haven't had to pay any interest on loans yet, so I opened a brokerage and started investing my salaries into a ROTH Ira, and from there investing into the smp 500 (Recommended by my father). I have pumped in $3,500 dollars into the smp 500 fund, and have $8000 in my savings as an emergency fund. I have a few questions about allocating my money. Should I have such a large emergency fund, or should I take a large chunk of that and invest it into something else like the fund or student debt?

Should I pay cash or put on cc and balance transfer?,"Hi all, I have a large veterinary bill coming up for my cat ($4-5k). I’m trying to decide how to pay for it. 

My finances are solid - nearly 1 year of expenses in a HYSA; maxing out the 401k, IRA, and HSA; no debt other than mortgage, which has an all-in cost of &lt;25% of my take home; stable job in a good industry. However, a year ago I was NOT in this position - I was an irresponsible spender who had a LOT of cc debt ($30k plus $10k in 401k loans!) so now that I’m out of consumer debt, I am still trying to learn how to spend responsibly, particularly with credit cards. 

The previous struggle with credit cards is part of why this question gives me a bit of a pause. A year ago I would have just tacked it on my balance and continued drowning. Now, I’m still trying to find the right middle ground between never using the cc at all, and going overboard, and could use a gut check on this one. 

My options are to pay cash for the procedure; pay cash for half and put the other half on the cc; or put all of it on the cc, and do a balance transfer to pay 0% for 14 months. I get 2% back on my citi and have a chase card with a balance transfer offer for 0% APR (4% fee for transfer). I can afford to take cash out, but it’ll obviously set back my savings, which makes me nervous. I could also put it on the citi cc and carry the balance for a month or two, and have it paid off? 

I fully recognize this is a first-world problem, but y’all have helped me a lot in learning smart financial moves, so now that I have a decent real-life “this or that” I would love to get some input.

How will collections affect my credit score?,"So about a month ago I transferred some money through paypal. For some unknown reason, the transfer from my bank failed to go through, but paypal still sent the money to the business, leaving me with a negative balance in paypal. I tried to send money to paypal from multiple bank accounts, but it would always give me errors. I contacted support about 6 times and they were never helpful. They either said to try again in a few days or to call their collections department. When I called the collections department they would tell me to call technical support, who would tell me to call the collections department. The only way the collections department would take payment is with a debit card, which I did not have so I eventually ordered one. I got the debit card today and called to pay, but they said they had already sent my debt to an outside collections company.

Money is a bit tight right now so I'm wondering what would happen if I do not repay this loan right away (or at all). I realize I won't be able to use paypal anymore, which I am perfectly fine with. According to Credit Karma my credit score has not been impacted by this going to collections yet. Will this eventually affect my credit score? Is there any way of knowing by how much?

Loan Forgiveness - Private School Teacher?,"I'm currently exploring my options for loan forgiveness as a teacher, but I have several questions &amp; I'm not sure where to start.

Here's a couple of details:

I'm in my 3rd full school year as a Social Studies teacher at a local private school in my area. With student loans going back into full effect at the end of January, I had a couple of friends reach out to me &amp; tell me that I might actually qualify for some loan forgiveness. I did some research &amp; found two that I *might* qualify for. The two loans include the **Perkins Loan Teacher Cancellation** &amp; the **Teacher Loan Forgiveness**.

I've read that I need to contact my school in order to get more information on the Perkins Loan cancellation (currently in the process of doing so), but not sure if I would quality if my non-profit private school is not listed TCLI Directory on the [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov) website. They seem to separate the use of public schools &amp; non-profit private schools. Same thing applies for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness; I'm currently staring at the application &amp; can receive up to $5,000 in forgiveness, but not sure if my school being non-profit is the only qualification (beyond the other qualifications, such as being a highly-qualified teacher), or if it's also required to be on the TCLI Directory. 

If anyone has any experience with this, or can offer any advice, I would appreciate it.

Should I take out a home improvement loan to hedge against inflation?,"This idea has been kicking around in my mind, and I was hoping for some feedback.

Debt and money in general become worth less as inflation rises. Inflation would erode the value of the debt payments over time.

California resident buying a house in Washington with parents,"**Context**

I am a California resident working in tech and living in San Francisco. I've been wanting to purchase a house for the past couple of years, but soaring SF house prices has made me put that project on pause. In the mean time, I'm living at my parents house, saving money.

My parents are retired and are living comfortably from the rental income they have from their commercial rental property.

They've decided to buy a brand new house in Camas, Washington where they can be closer to my Grandparents and live their retirement years in nature. Camas is a beautiful little city that's actually a part of the Portland metropolitan area.

The house they're purchasing is not built yet. It's part of a planned community and the developer just confirmed that they're ready to start building. They just have to get the loan and go through with it. I've seen the model home and the other, already built houses on the block and can easily see them living/retiring here comfortably for the rest of their lives.

**The proposal**

My dad asked me if I want to buy the Washington house. It's 900k for a very large and brand new house in a city that he is positive is going to keep rising in value. From the research I've done, I have no reason to doubt this. 

My parents will live in Camas, and I'll live in their SF house which is probably worth around 2M now.

In the end, I'll inherit their SF house, and I'll own a house in Camas.

Are there any reasons to not do this?

I Bonds vs High Yield Savings Accounts for Emergency Fund,"I’ve tried approaching the following decision analytically but am checking if others have experienced similar decisions or can see any of my blind spots.

I have a pretty high savings rate and hate to leave my dollars working inefficiently. The more I save, the quicker I can reach financial independence. In my 20’s I’ve stayed in 100% stocks and have not purchased any bonds. I have a pretty tough skin and risk tolerance and didn’t even consider selling during the short 2020 market crash.

However, I also understand the importance of an emergency fund. I started with around $10,000 in an Ally savings account and have increased it up to $25,000 over the past few years.

More recently, I’ve considered putting most of my emergency fund into I-bonds. I understand they are less liquid than a savings account but in the long run will be less affected by inflation. Looking at historic rates, they almost always are at least 1-2% higher than a high yield savings account.  https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni

The pro to an online savings account is only liquidity and money available within a few days. 

From what I can tell about I-bonds the pros and cons are:

Pros:

1. Higher Inflation Protected Interest Rates

Cons:

1. Locked up for 1 year from time of purchase.

2. Forfeit 3 months interest if redeemed within 5 years

3. Limited to $10,000 purchased per year 

4. May take longer to redeem in an emergency 

I think I can deal with all of the cons in my current situation. If I purchase 10k this year and 10k towards the end of next year I could limit my exposure to liquidity issues. My plan would be to buy 10k this December, bring my emergency fund savings account back to 20k by next December, then buy 10k more. At that point I would have 20k in I-bonds and 10k in a savings account. Ideally for small emergencies I wouldn’t even have to touch the I-bonds. Even sacrificing 3 months of interest after 1 year I would still be ahead relative to a high yield savings account. 9 months at an I bond rate beats 12 months at current savings accounts rates.

In the short term, 15k liquidity is plenty. I have a local safety net and could both cover a 6-month lease liability ($3750) and the maximum out of pocket for health insurance ($6500). Worst case I could also move back in with parents and just pay for partial utilities and food. My current industry also has a pretty high demand so it wouldn’t be difficult to get another similar paying job.

One of my main concerns is how difficult it is in practice to redeem I-bonds. Could I put a large emergency expense on a credit card, cash in the same amount of electronic I-bonds the same day, and be able to pay off the credit card within 3 weeks?",0,1636996208,474,2706

Talk me out of selling my vehicle.. or into it,"So here is our dilemma.

We have too much car. Not too much car for our budget, but too much vehicle for our needs. We bought a 2012 Suburban prior to the birth of our third child. It has leather, third row, and even DVD which we don't really use that much.

We purchased it on a 5 year loan for about $15,000 for a dealership that I used to work at.

Two and a half years later, our second car died - this vehicle was more bare bones.

My wife is totally fine with having cloth seats and not much else in a vehicle.

At the moment, our payoff is around $13,500. I've done a couple ""Instant Cash Offers"" and it's worth at least $2000 more than payoff if we sold it or traded it in, thanks to the crazy used car market. The Suburban also needs some repairs, totaling around $700.

In payments, we've spent around $10,000 so far.

Vehicles like ours are selling for $17,000 plus, with the same miles or more.

We are also considering replacing our second car with a cheaper, more stripped down used Mitsubishi. 

I also work at home and she's a SAHM for now. We don't drive all that much but having a second car is great when we want to go to separate places.

Our car payment is currently $365. We might be able to do two cheaper car payments for about the same total.

Bank Keeps Declining Purchases Despite Me Having Plenty Of Money In My Account,"I got a new card two days ago and I've been trying to use it ever since to pay bills and buy a few things but everytime I try my bank declines even though I have $250 in my account (more than enough to cover everything).

Nervous to save money,I'm 28 with around $5k in cash savings and $40k in my 401K. I have been told time and time again by friends and family that I need to save more money. The problem is it really makes me nervous to put money away rather than spend it on things I enjoy. There are two reasons for this. The first is that I am worried about inflation and the possibility of societal collapse making my savings worthless. My second worry is what if I die at 30 in a car crash? All that sacrifice saving for retirement would be a total waste. It really makes me sad to see money getting put away that I may never get to use. Is this normal and what are people doing to cope with it?,0,1636994001,132,659
Hedging against inflation with a 529,"There are state 529 plans available which promise to hedge against inflation by buying college tuition at today's prices to be applied to future attendance. One example is Virginia 529 Tuition Track Portfolio.  

Briefly, the way it currently works is that you can buy 1 unit for about $138.  Then, ""When it’s time to use your units, your student will receive one year of the current Average Tuition for every 100 units previously purchased, regardless of how much tuition rates have grown.""

Upset that I'm not wealthy,"I know this sounds ridiculous but I feel like lately I am constantly around wealthy people and I'm sad that I never will have what they have. I am 43 years old, my DH is 47 and I feel like over the past year or so it has really sunk in for me that this is my life and we are never going to be rich. I never worried about these things and I'm not sure why I am now. I live in the Boston area and there are a lot of successful people here. I work for a university, I have a masters degree but I guess I'm a field where I'll never make a lot. Same goes for DH. we have two kids who are 5 and 7 who we love to pieces. In June 2020 we moved from a middle class area to a more affluent area for the better schools. I just feel like everyone around us a Senior VP of some company or has inherited millions from their family. Last night we went to a bruins game with a guy who lives in a 3 million dollar house ( he runs a construction company). A bunch of his friends were there and they're all just like him. I know the middle class is shrinking...and I guess it's really true. I Just feel like wealthy people stick together and it's pointless to try to be real friends with them. I know few 'middle class' people anymore. 

It feels like people are either rich or living in the ghetto these days with few in between. I feel sort of lonely and cant find people similar to myself. LIfe isn't all about socio economic class...but it does get depressing for me to always be around people who seem to have so much more.

It’s not too late to catch up on your 401k,"Just wanted to share with this sub that i noticed that i hadn’t fully taken advantage of my 401k because the percentage coming out of my paycheck didn’t add up to the $19.5k yearly max. So for the final paychecks of 2021 i’ve upped my percentage to a whopping 50% of my pay. 

The result is obviously that my take home pay for these paychecks is significantly reduced, but i’ll be taking cash out of savings to cover the difference. So in a sense it’s kind of like moving cash from savings into my 401k.

I’m not recommending this as a strategy but for anyone else like me who mistakenly didn’t put enough into the 401k throughout the year, i thought it might be useful to know about.",0,1636993947,127,684

Is catastrophic insurance worth it?,"I'm a contractor so I don't have health insurance through my job. I don't have any preexisting conditions or ongoing medical needs. The plans available to me after speaking with a state health care representative in CT all seem like a rip off. They have a catastrophic plan with $195 premiums, $8,550 in network deductible, $15,000 out of network deductible, max out of pocket $8,550 and $20,000 for in and out of network. I am healthy but I work out regularly running, in-door rock climbing, weight lifting. I'm concerned what would happen if I got injured doing something athletic.   
I don't know if having insurance for peace of mind would even be worth it. If I break my ankle and need a trip to the ER and the bill is $8,549 I'd be stuck with the whole bill and I'd still be paying $195 per month for nothing. I guess not getting this insurance is just a $195 gamble that I won't hurt myself and if I do it will cost more than $8,550.  
Paying $195 per month for this feels like throwing money away but not having any coverage also feels risk.

Does an HSA and a high deductible health plan make sense given high prescription costs?,"A bit of context:

My company’s open enrollment is currently happening, and this year they’re starting to offer HDHP + HSA combo for the first time. 

My current health plan is very good, they pay the full amount so nothing comes out of my paycheck for it. It has a $250 deductible, and a $2,250 co-insurance out of pocket max where I pay 10% and the insurer covers the other 90%. I have pretty high medical needs and tend to hit right around the out of pocket max each year (insurer paid out ~221k for all my claims this year). I also have an FSA @ $1,500 that I already used up (I plan on upping this next year if I stick with my current plan). I’m also on a very expensive specialty tier 4 medication, and currently I only pay $45/month for the medicine. 

Now, the HDHP has a $2,800 deductible, which based on my medical needs I’ll be hitting that pretty quickly. My company will also be contributing to my HSA every paycheck, around $1,400 of free money annually. With the HSA contribution max limit of $3,450 that means I’ll be paying around $2k for my deductible if my math is current. Then everything will be covered at 100% instead of my current 90%. 

Here’s my kicker: however, I’m reading that prescription medication is not part of the deductible? This is what the plan says about my tier of medication: “30% coinsurance up to $300 per prescription after deductible is met (home delivery)”

So this is where I’m being skeptical about doing HDHP at all. My insurance pays out around $8k/month just for my specialty medication. So does that mean that on top of the ~$2k I pay for my deductible I’ll also be paying $300/month for my meds? 

Even with the $1,400 employer contribution and supposed tax benefits - this might not make sense for me? Especially if I’m likely to max out my HSA given the contribution limit and it won’t even be able to grow if I’ll be pulling out almost all of it each year? 

I should note that this medication and overall insurance cost is my baseline (plus annual MRI’s/X-rays). Under my current plan I’m paying $250+$2250 (which mostly includes the $45/month pills). Under HDHP, I’ll be paying $2,800 + $300/month minus the $1,400 employee match. Seems like not a good deal unless I’m missing something? I’m in California is that helps.

Inheritance dilemma,"Hello! Looking for some fresh perspectives on how to allocate an inheritance for my daughter.

I like him very much and feel I should give some amount to him as well, but it would have to come from the $10,000. Should I give each of them $5,000?

Is there a way to empirically see how much contribution/benefit it provides to a certain country if I buy products based in that country?,"This is probably not the right subreddit to ask but have no idea where else to post. Please feel free to redirect me.

To elaborate my question, most people know that If I buy a Ford vehicle, some manufacturing and parts might come from other countries as opposed to from the US, therefore, SOME of benefit goes to the people of that country. There are also foreign shareholders for public companies so if an American company in the NYSE does well and stock appreciates, one could argue that more benefit goes to their country. As an another example, if I hire an accountant who works for himself within my town in US, economic benefit also stays here. This might be contrary to if I needed a similar accounting service but hired an accountant from a major CPA firm that might outsource some tasks.

Best way to save up for a down payment? Invest into a “safe” stock or into a savings account?,"So looking to save up for a down payment on a home. Im in LA so 20% on a standard condo here in a half decent area is going to be circa 150-300k. I don’t really want to do an FHA as firstly they max out and secondly I’m not for the PMI that gets attached to it.

I can currently put down around 5k a month into a savings account so in around 2-4 years i should be there (depending on how the housing market grows!).

When it eventually comes to buying I won’t need the money there and then that day… just a few weeks within the range so whilst I appreciate it needs to be liquid, I can definitely wait to get my hands on my money if it means it grows.

Question is:

1) does it make sense to just put money into a savings account with such poor interest? Is there a way to make it grow over 2-4 years

2) if it does grow, I’m assuming the capital gains tax comes into consideration here and may not be worth it?

3) understandably there is a risk as the market could have a downturn and I lose my down payment. So what other ways could I make that money work harder? In my head the s&amp;p 500 with a crocs 7-10% growth rate could help?

Is there any benefit to consolidating all of my CC debt to one card?,"I recently received a credit limit increase on my main credit card, and the new limit would allow me to completely pay off two other credit cards that have both a 900$ and 1300$ balance on them.

I know it’s not really “paying off” either of those cards as it’s just transferring the debts to another card, but are there any pros or cons to this? My logic is now I would be able to close out the card I do not need while being able to pay down everything on one account instead of 3, which is even more convenient as my main credit card is linked to my bank account on my phone and I can monitor it through the app.

I’m a total noob at financing though when it comes to the world of credit scores and interests and such. Is it a bad idea to put so much debt on one card so quickly? It has a 3500$ limit now and with paying off the cards would be pushing around 2800$ in debt on it currently.",0,1636991319,219,1097
Should I Ask to be Removed as an Authorized User After Credit Score Drop?,"Short version: Will removing myself as an authorized user on a cc with high usage drop my credit score more than it has already dropped?


Full question:

I got a notification that my credit score dropped about 40 points. After investigating, I think it’s because I’m an authorized user on one of my parents’ credit cards. They have a card with a $12k limit and put a $10k purchase on it. While my overall usage is still well under 10%, having one card with over 80% usage seems to have had a major impact.

I called Chase (the account is listed as JP Morgan Chase on my credit report) and, even with my parents’ SSNs and partial account number, they were not able to find the account and didn’t see me listed as an authorized user for any Chase accounts, so they couldn’t remove me. (I don’t really speak to my parents so I wanted to avoid calling them if possible).

After the call ended, I realized I didn’t know if this was the right decision. **Would removing myself as an authorized user drop my credit score even more?**

I know they will pay off the card within the month, but from experience, I expect it to take 3-6 months for my score to go back to normal. My score is still in the high 700s, but I’m thinking of buying a new car, about half with financing, and want to make sure I can get the best rate available.

I have good insurance and recently went to the hospital for a cut and trauma resulting from a fall that ended up not needing any real treatment. So, 30 minutes of waiting room plus five minutes of face time with a doctor and an x-ray. Clean bill of health, just really badly bruised.

After about a month I got a notice that insurance had paid $2400 and I owed like $50. Cool. I called and paid $50 by card the next day. A month after that, I got a $2600 bill in the mail, which was over $5000 before insurance helped, with a reason given by my insurance for not covering the rest as ""not medically necessary"". I called the hospital 5 weeks ago to ask for an itemized bill to explain this $2600 before I pay. The lady said ""sure!"" and I was on my way.

Well, last week I received a second notice to pay threatening collections. Still no itemized bill. I called back and the same lady I talked to a month or more ago said that she had confirmation the request for an itemized bill was being worked on. Is there any way I can document for billing that I am waiting for an itemized bill before I pay? I asked the person I spoke to about my itemized bill and she said the people who would send unpaid bills to collections were ""another department"". Can they send this to collections while I am waiting for the bill? This situation seems bizarre!

Just hoping for some insight. I have very little experience with the US medical system. My insurance has always just covered anything that happened, or I felt my remaining bill was reasonable, so I am new to these billing games.",0,1636990027,337,1832

Should I wait until I get a new car before opening a new credit card?,"I ordered a new car a month ago, and am waiting for it to arrive (likely end of January).

I pay my credit card balances in full every month.

UK national pension question,"Pensions are supposed to be calculated 4 weekly. I got my first pension payment today (15th Nov). Will my next payment be 15th Dec?

Will a land lord rent to me if my partner and I don't make x3 the rent separately but together we do?,"HOWDY!

Today my partner and I are visiting a 1bdr 1ba apartment that is $500/mo with $500 deposit. I already called their office and they allow both partners to be on a lease, it doesn't have to be just one.

Their rule is you have to make x3 the rent (so $1,500 pre-tax).

My question is if that rule applies whenever you have a roommate(although they're my partner).

So the rent in question is $500, but divided by 2 is $250, and x3 that would be $750.

My partner and I are college students that work 25/hrs a week, separately we make only $1,100 a month but together make $2,200/mo, which is more than enough to pay for that x3 rule.

My credit score is 765 and my partner's is 740 for perspective. If we give them the credit score + pay stubs to prove our income would they approve us?

Inheriting a house but not officially owning it. Questions on how to pay for it and not get screwed on taxes,"So this is kinda complex here. My aunt died and my mom became the executrix of the estate. With the estate was a house that my mom doesn't need and wants me to live in. Here's where things get kinda strange:

So the house was about to go to closing before my aunt died. The buyer of the house and us settled on a deal that involves us paying him 25k and if we sell it in the next 10 years we need to pay him part of the sale price. 

The nice thing is we don't have any plans on selling the place so it works in our favor. The house has several years of taxes due and this year is also due so we have about 60-70k in taxes to pay as well. We were considering using the money in the estate to pay off those taxes. 

Now with all of this said, how can I pay off everything without getting really screwed on taxes at the end of the year and how can I pay for the renovations on the place if I don't officially ""own"" the property?",0,1636987764,190,926

Inheriting money - how best to use it," Sorry for using a throwaway account, but it is for obvious reasons.

I have recently heard from my terminally ill mother that I’ll be receiving anywhere between £350,000 and £500,000 when she dies next year.

This is a big shock. My wife and I are both artists, and are successful enough to make a reasonable living from it, (way below the national average I’m sure, but fine for us) but I’ve got to my 50’s and have no private pension. We have a toddler who we are desperate to benefit from/pass as much of this on to when we are gone as we can, as we won’t be able to build up anything like this amount.

We have a 3 bedroom house that we bought cheap and renovated that we have a mortgage on.

What do you suggest we do with the money to improve our child's life, yet have a reasonable amount left for them to inherit when we’re gone?

Our spitballed plan: 

Keep £10,000 aside to contribute towards 10 years of family holidays, going abroad every other year. We aren’t expecting this to pay for the holidays, just contribute enough that we are able to save from our current incomes and afford them.

All the rest of the figures are of course approximate.

If the sum is at the £350,000 end, over the next few years buy a renovateable £250,000 property (cash sale/auction) and spend £100,000 to sell for £420,000.

Repeat this over the few years after that.

Then with the accumulated money, spend £100,000 on years 7 to 11 education for our child, and buy a final property to renovate and live in.

If the sum is closer to £500,000, put £100,000 aside for years 7 to 11 education for our child, then renovate/flip one property before buying a second property to renovate and live in, keeping some aside as a retirement fund.",0,1636987026,307,1729
Caught up on Roth IRA and emergency fund - where to start investing in Vanguard?,"Hey there, this is the first year where I finally feel comfortable with my emergency fund (roughly 15 - 20k that just sits in savings), I've contributed fully into my Roth IRA on Vanguard, and my employer doesn't have matching 401k.

How to hold emergency fund?,"Wife and I have a 6mo. emergency fund. due to my income and our expenses (she's a stay at home mom, we're raising 5 kids, kids are expensive yo). It's a pretty sizable amount of money. 

We're debt free besides the house (which will be paid off in \~8-10  years), we invest more than 15% of our income each month, and we budget pretty strictly. 

The question I have is, currently the Emergency fund is currently 80% cash in a bank, 20% cash on hand. I was thinking of moving that to 50% cash in bank, 40% precious metals (gold/silver), and 10% cash. Thinking being, if I do not have access to that bank account, and burn through the cash, I would be able to exchange the PMs at a pawn shop or gold/silver place for cash/money orders, without having to have a fat stack of cash on hand all the time. This is truly ""emergency money"" in that I have a lot of other options I would exercise first, long before this money was touched, so thinking of worst case scenarios. It's a lot easier if I had to move, or leave my home quickly to grab a couple of 1oz gold bars than grab a stack of 100's. And I have a small fireproof safe kept inside of a larger gun safe, a couple of oz of PMs in there is a lot easier to store and would survive a fire better than cash, even if it  melts, gold is gold, but cash would turn to ash.

I was wondering what other people do to keep their emergency funds? I'm not a prepper, other than just... being prepared. I don't think the worst is going to happen, but I've seen the worst happen to people, and want to be prepared just in case.",0,1636985956,306,1564

How do I minimize tax liabilities when rolling over my 6-figure profit sharing(not 401k/match) into a Roth? Is a Roth even the right move?,"Hi, my company contributes 25% of my compensation into a pre-tax profit sharing account. It is a vesting plan(20%/yr) but I cannot rollover the vested portion. I can only rollover when I leave the company. If I leave at year 5, my profit sharing account will be around $200k. My salary is above 150k so most of the $200k will be taxed at 35% since my income for that year will be $350k+. Is there any way to minimize this? If not, can you guys check my math for why I choose Roth over Traditional?

If I don't contribute anything beyond the 200k(unlikely since I can keep doing backdoor roth), I still get $2.4m at 8% compound interest over 35 years. At that point, my Roth passive income is about $192k. I also have a brokerage account that also has a brokerage account with $750k which will be $11M. that would bring my passive income at 65 to be in the tax bracket. As such, I believe that Roth is still better since my retirement income will be top bracket whereas the Roth upfront tax is only second highest bracket. Am I making the right call?",0,1636984813,195,1049
Is it worth pulling money out of my 401k to diversify into an annuity?,"I was chatting with someone in finance and he was telling me that it's silly to have everything in my 401k.  
There are companies with annuity products that can take a chunk of your 401k and roll it into a Roth product (no penalties) that will pay you monthly after a you reach a certain age.   
I'm currently 46 and have ~450k in the 401k. He ran the numbers for me with the largest benefit (age 72, though I could do an earlier age with less money), taking about a third of my 401k.   
I guess it essentially creates a pension for me and helps diversify in the event the market tanks.  
One concern is if I don't live that long. The principal is guaranteed, but if my beneficiaries are just getting back the principal and I never got the monthly benefit, it was a waste of 26 years of potential gains.  
Obviously, if I live a long time, it's a great thing to have. There is no limit to the number of monthly payments.

Tips for disputing an inaccurate collections account.,"I recently cancelled my internet with Spectrum and my account was closed down. During the moving process I packed away the router and modem, and forgot to return them. Spectrum hit my credit report with a collections account for the expense of the equipment.

I returned it and the original collection was removed, however I just noticed two of the same collection have just been added to my credit report even though it has been cleared up with Spectrum and the original collection was removed.

Is going all in on the S&amp;P 500 a good idea?,"I'm investing about 60% of my total money which I won't need for the foreseeable future. I'm investing it on vanguard in the UK and so far have about 65% in the vusa fund (S&amp;P 500) and 35% in a lifestagey 40 fund. The vusa has returned about 10x more than the LS40 and with inflation going up and me not needing the money anyway I'm getting rid of the LS40. Now not sure whether to put the money into Veve (developed world index), vwrl (all world index) or double down on vusa. My dad thinks just go for vusa and if we're going on the past performance of the last 10 years then he is right. 

I don't like the idea of having all my money in one fund but when you look at the actual numbers and the fact that a crash in the US market will crash the global markets but a crash in a frogien market won't crash the US market and also the fact that over the last year Veve and Vwrl have had a negative historical earnings growth over the last year but vusa has been positive the case for having only vusa looks pretty solid. 

Obviously no one can predict the future but past performance is all we have to go off. 

So is vusa a good bet or should I get Veve or Vwrl for the added diversification? Personally I think it makes no real difference which one you get, vusa has slightly higher returns over a 5 year period and the others might have slightly lower volatility but it's basically the same.

Going back to school. Is my financial plan solid?,"\[throwaway because of personal information\]

I'm planning to go back to school for a 3-year degree, starting next September. I've been working full time for the past 8 years with good salaries while living rather frugally. My financial situation is very comfortable, but somehow the prospect of having no/low income for a prolonged period of time is making me nervous. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance!

I recently got a job which requires me to travel in different state in either 2mos or 3 mos interval(shipping car would be expensive? and  time consuming, as for driving it and keep putting miles on it would depreciate the value) also I'm planning on upgrading next year to an SUV, I need a larger car for my kid.

My option is 
1. To payoff the car and then sell it once I got the title(probably this December i can pay it off)
2. Just straight send it to the dealer/carmax and have it valued then sell.

Is there a pro or cons in each route?

Take debt to the grave?,"Hi everyone! 

This is something that I have been thinking about for a while but I’m wondering if it’s something that would actually work.

I don’t plan to have kids. I don’t have any assets other than a house, car, and some cryptocurrency. 

If I take on the debt of my family with no co-signers, can the bank go after anyone after I die? 

Basically, if I, as an individual, acquire the debt of multiple individuals can banks (or anyone else) seek the settle that debt from anyone I’m related to?",0,1636966343,90,498
Should I have been conducting myself as a sole proprietorship?,"I'm a college student, soon approaching the job market but still have a year to go. In the meantime I've been building websites for local small businesses and individuals who either don't have a website or their design is bad/outdated. 

The process usually goes: I show them what I can do for them, they approve, I code &amp; deliver website, they pay, we happily part ways.

Well, now I've been aiming to land bigger clients became I have some bills to pay and I came across a company who assumed I was an independent contractor.  This was through a cold call and I told them it was just me, not a web development agency. They immediately responded with ""oh, okay. You're an independent contractor, gotcha."" And moved on with the conversation without a beat. The call ended with good results, the manager is going to consult their budget with the owner and get back with me.

My issue is, that later I looked up the ""official"" definition of an independent contractor...and I'm not registered as a business or sole proprietorship in any way shape or form. I'm just a college kid trying to earn money in my free time.

I don't want to jeopardize this deal because I really need as many clients as I can get but I don't want any trouble with the irs or leave a bad taste in the clients mouth because certain things aren't in order.

I've never had this come up before in the 3 years I've been doing this? Should I just go ahead and let them know I might not be qualified tax-wise? Should I have been registered this whole time?",0,1636965690,276,1526
Ally Bank: Watch out if you go to a foreign country!,"I have been a customer of Ally for many years, but I got a big let down recently and I will start moving away from it. I wanted to share my experience so it does not happen to someone else.

We went to Europe for vacations for few weeks. In the middle of the vacations, Ally detected our out of US login and interpreted this as a fraud. (We have been traveling for years, and never had any issue.) The worst part is that they didn’t tell us about it. They just locked our account, with no email, no message in the app, but we could still login and things were mostly working. They did send us a letter home several days after to let us know that our accounts were locked. 😂

&amp;#x200B;

In reality, our accounts were locked, and there was no possible debits. Our rent bounced, that’s how I notice something was off when I saw that our rent was not properly debited. Then the rental property management company locked our account because the rent bounced, now we had to do a bunch of back and forth while in Europe with them to pay the banks at a distance. They wanted a money order or cashier’s check, good luck when you are out of country. We were finally able to wire the money from BoA (could not trust Ally anymore, esp. with their phone verification for wire, roaming is not reliable, and the time difference would mean that I could miss the call).

&amp;#x200B;

It took several weeks to put everything back to normal with all the parties. We had some late fees and bouncing fees from the rental place, but Ally eventually reimbursed them. They were “sorry for the inconvenience” but this definitely put a sour / stressful note for our vacations.

How to rebalance 401k with VTWAX?,"So I’m 23 and was thinking of going all VTWAX in my Roth IRA. But my 401k doesn’t have VTWAX as an option. For almost 2 years I’ve been doing target date fund 2065 with 0.08% expense ratio. However, I feel like 10% bonds is a waste and wouldn’t mind rebalancing myself.

My question is, how do I rebalance if I want to mimic VTWAX? 

1) if the market cap changes from 35% international 65% domestic, do I rebalance everything? Or just change the contributions. Would not touching it for a year and rebalancing every year be good enough/optimal?

2) I could just go with Vanguard’s recommendations and not do VTWAX. Vanguard recommends 40% VTIAX. I know this matches market cap. But what if vanguards recommendations don’t match market cap? Which do I trust?

3) If I don’t mind rebalancing is it worth it to not use the TDF because of 10% bonds?

Asking for a raise,"I currently work for a pretty small operation as a sales rep. I get paid a base rate of $600 a month, plus 40% commission. My background is in sales so this has been extremely easy for me, I’m bringing in $4-$5k a month every month. I am leading the other sales rep by a wide margin. 

Recently the owner decided he wanted to hire more sales reps. However it’s been leaked that he is offering them $2000 a month base and they will start earning commission after they hit a certain number. It would also be less commission. 

I think the fact they are getting a higher base doesn’t sit well with me, even though adding up the math, I will easily be making more than them (unless they eat into my sales). 

I wanted to approach him with a similar deal, but I would need a base rate of $4.5k just to make it worth it and not lose money I would make on commission. I really don’t think he would ever go for that. I don’t think I can approach him and say I want a flat raise not based on how much sales I can bring in. 

Just wondering if there is a good way to do this?",0,1636962805,212,1065
My parent's cash savings and what to do with it,"**Backstory**

My parents sought refuge and immigrated to the United States in the '90s and since then they have been saving cash, physical cash. My parents have been used to the way they and their families before them have been saving money which is not at a bank, a common method outside the U.S.

When I was born my parents decided to start saving for a college fund because they have heard how expensive college can be and so they have been saving for over 18 years. Their savings come from tips and their income. They pay taxes and whatever they have left that they deem is not essential they put it in the savings jar. My whole childhood we were the cheapest people alive. My mother would repackage and drive back to a store to return a $1 dollar item. We would live on the bare minimum. 

I was never told any of this or even knew about the savings until recently. My parents didn't want me to know until the time was right and to them, that would be when I am looking at colleges. Ultimately, I did not decide to go to college but enlist in the military instead and with the GI Bill, the college fund no longer served its purpose, and now they want to use that money to buy me a house. 

**The Situation**

So I've come to find out that my parents have saved 6 figures of physical cash in the house, and now they want to buy a house. Since the beginning, they have only deposited money in the bank that was needed such as rent, credit card payments, etc, and those were about less than $5K a month. Everything else would be saved in cash. This was mostly due to them not understanding banking and laws in the U.S. and them being used to their own way of saving not knowing that this could be a potential issue in the future. My parents were also subject to credit card fraud in the early 2010s that further led to a distrust of placing large sums of their savings in the hands of banks. So now what do I do? Any deposit over $10K is reported and I don't know how to explain how all of a sudden they have such large sums of money.",0,1636961611,389,2037
Buy A House or Focus On Retirement?,"2020 really opened my (42M) eyes to my financial situation. I can't change my past but I'm really hoping to gain some more knowledge to help me out going forward in my life. So much great advice aimed at the young crowed and that's a wonderful thing but hard to find anything specific to me. I've realized how far I am on retirement savings so trying to figure out if I should just focus on that or see if there is also any hope to own a home. I'll just drop my details below and see what people have to say.

* Age: 42
* Annual Income: $75k
* Debt: $0
* Credit Score: 796 - 816 (Depending on Credit Bureau)
* Emergency Savings: 20K (Covers 1 year of current expenses)
* Mutual Fund Investments: $5K
* 401K: $60K  
* Kids: No (Can't have)
* Rent: $1,310 Monthly ($655 Split with GF).
* Location: Southern California

&amp;#x200B;

Not counting my GF income ($70K) because she has student loan debt with a 4 year plan to pay it off. Meanwhile since my E Fund is complete, I started investing in an S&amp;P Mutual Fund outside of my 401K which I am currently getting the full 401K company match and recently started an HSA with my company contributing $1K.

I'm not comfortable with a 2-3 month E fund as I often read is suggested but I was wondering if I should invest at least half of my current E Fund in hopes to maybe grow for a House down payment. Current apartment is actually really decent for what we pay in rent but would be nice to have a yard for a Dog or 2 since we can't have kids among other things we don't currently have access to. We have looked at other rental options but honestly, to get a true upgrade from where we are at now, rents are looking at around $2,500/Month and I know some would say that would be better going towards a mortgage. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",0,1636961202,331,1798

Is the burden on the merchant to reach out about unpaid balances?,"I recently purchased a product online that had a promotion to pay an initial small price to use the product for a trial period. If you returned it by the end of the trial period, you don't have to pay the full price of the product. But, if you kept it, you would get charged the full price at the end of the trial period.

I liked the product and kept it. But, during the trial period, the credit card I used to pay the initial price got cancelled and replaced because of fraudulent charges that appeared on it. Five days before the trial period ended, I reached out to customer service explaining the situation and asked to update my credit card information so that the charge would go through since I couldn't find a way to update it online. They told me they were unable to update my credit card information because of ""security reasons"" and told me to contact my bank to forward the payment. I did, and my bank said it was a weird situation of a merchant refusing updated payment info, gave me a suggestion that Visa *might* (no guarantees) automatically forward the charge through an obscure feature called auto-updater, and said if there were any issues, to tell the merchant to contact my bank. I forwarded all of this information to customer service by email and made it clear in writing that I am offering to guarantee that the charge goes through at the end of the trial period by giving them my updated card info. But, if they refused to update and if there were any issues, they would need to contact my bank. Customer service told me they had to at least attempt to charge my cancelled card, and if I notice that the charge is declined, to reach out back out to them, which is stupid because I'm pretty sure you can't see charges to a credit card that has been cancelled. At least I definitely can't with my bank.

I never bothered to respond to that last email or reach out, nor have I noticed any charges to my new credit card or my account for the outstanding balance. The merchant has never bothered to reach out to me in the 2 months since and they've never sent me an invoice or any communication via email, mail or phone number, which they all have. I've read horror stories of people's credit scores getting destroyed by debts they didn't know they had. And I wanted to ask, what are my obligations in this situation? What is the merchant legally required to do if they want to collect on an unpaid balance and within what timeframe?",0,1636960178,451,2454
Thoughts On Midland RetireVantage 10 Fixed Indexed Annuity?,"Hi all,

I'm concerned about what's going on with the stock market, which I feel is decoupled from reality and the rest of the economy, and I'm expecting a possibly severe and prolonged market crash. So I've been trying to figure out potential alternatives for my IRAs which are currently at Vanguard, where I had them in Total Stock Market Index Funds. I'm concerned about stagflation and potential lost decade(s). Like others here, I've looked into cash accumulation fixed indexed annuities, since they offer principal protection. I understand in general these products can be problematic since they can have caps, spreads, and limited participation rates, and the companies can change those as they wish.

However, I'm wondering if anybody has experience with Midland's RetireVantage 10 FIA, which seems like a pretty good product for this type? Or if not personal experience, thoughts on the design of this annuity?

These are the Allocation Options I'm considering going with at 25% each:

S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility Daily Risk Control 8% (2YPP): Current Declared Rate: 2.75% Annual Margin times 2 (applied at end of term) - No Strategy Fee

BlackRock ESG US 5% Index ER (APP): 115.00% Annual Participation Rate - 1.00% Strategy Fee

S&amp;P Multi-Asset Risk Control 5% Excess Return (APP): 105.00% Annual Participation Rate - 1.00% Strategy Fee

Fidelity MFY 5% ER (2YPP): 165.00% Two-Year Participation Rate - 1.00% Strategy Fee


Regarding the 2 Year Point To Points, an option would be to stagger the indices after the 1st year, so that interest is credited yearly.

This is info I got on Midland as a company: Midland does things agent direct, so that results in lower fees, Midland's financial strength is very solid, Midland has a high Comdex score, so that should be good for safety and security, Midland has good index choices, the S&amp;P Low Vol 8 is doing well, and there's no fee for that choice, the Strategy Fees are 1%, and there's a True-Up Feature at year 10, which should make opting for the Strategy Fees worth it.

I haven’t been able to pay these debts for years, so I’m hoping they’ll take the payment and be done with it instead of continuing through the courts.

Quantum Computing: Is it better to invest in a single stock or in an ETF?,"Hey all. I’m planning on investing in quantum computing, but I’m a bit torn on where exactly to begin considering its nature as an emerging technology. I come from a computer science background, so I’m fairly comfortable reading about QC itself (and I definitely see how disruptive it could be), but it’s the financial side where I’m a bit lost.

I did my due diligence and read into quantum computing’s overall trend and major commercial applications (e.g. [quantum computing explained for investors](https://frontierresearch.com/quantum-computing/?r=1)) but it’s choosing what specifically to put my money in that I still need help on. Here are some things I’m thinking about:

* I know for a fact that [IONQ is performing well](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ionq-becomes-first-publicly-traded-120000782.html) right now, but is it a good idea to invest in it now or try and wait for a competitor to be more active in the market to see more movement? (In this case Supernova)
* Some large cap companies are also getting into quantum computing, such as Google/Alphabet. But should I pick these companies where quantum computing is a side project or stick to companies where it’s the sole focus?
* Alternatively, there’s always the case of ETFs. There’s [QTUM/Defiance](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/quantum-computing-etf/), which already holds some of the larger cap stocks I’m watching, like AMD and NVDA. Is it safer to go for an EFT or go for the single stocks?

I’m planning on holding for now and not actively trade, so I’m a bit unsure what would be the right move for long-term returns. Any tips/advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",0,1636958012,252,1705

easiest way to get an apartment when starting a new job?,"hi f:18 here , first things first , i can’t get a co-signer because my mom is extremely toxic and doesn’t want me to succeed. my dad lives in new jersey , i don’t have family down here except for my 70+ year old grandma.

i got kicked out again and I am staying at a friends apartment. 

I have a job offer from ikea downtown , so i’m going to have to move downtown. i don’t have terrible credit and last time i checked my credit score it was 670 . first time renter .

I’m wondering if I can get an offer letter from ikea and pay a deposit for proof of income . 

the apartments I was looking at are $1,100 or $1275 (depending on which one i choose) and are located near ikea downtown. 

I am currently working at chili’s which on average (the manager said) i’ll be making $100-$150 a night . I start serving on tuesday night and I’m going to be working 6 days a week = $3,600/mth 

My friend (19, 18 when she started renting) told me she got her apartment by submitting a proof of income letter and explicitly telling them she was starting a new job and had no rental history. She did not need a co-signer or to submit bank statements.

If this serving job works out , I would love to rent in this area but it’s $1450+ a month on average and has smaller square footage than getting a place downtown (it’s kind of a suburban area outside of downtown) so i’m honestly not sure. 

ikea calls me back on monday so i’m actually scrambling to find out if i should accept it 100% for sure but i do know i will need an offer letter if i want an apartment downtown.

401k allocation thoughts,"Age of 28 and maxing out everything, gunning to retire around 50. 

Current allocation:
- 50% 2060 retirement target date, .45% fee (REMTX - American funds)

- 20% small cap vanguard, low fee

I like having the diversity and allocation shift in the retirement target date fund, but obviously hate the fee. And I want to stay aggressive before retirement. Keeping 2060 date is aggressive too for my earlier retirement goal.

Is there a way to jump-start a retirement account with a big wad of cash?,"I am 37. I have not been very smart with my money, but I'm trying to learn how to invest for retirement now that it's kinda too late.

I have some old 401ks with not much money in them (\~$25k total?) and for the past few years have been contributing the max to an HSA. Have about $150k in savings.

My main question is: is it possible for me to sock away half of that savings money right into a retirement account today? It seems like no matter what, there are always limits to how much you can take from a non-investment account and put into an investment account. Am I wrong - is there a way? I want to jump-start the retirement investment with this cash, but it seems like it's impossible over the maximum.

If it's not possible at all, my plan was to open a brokerage account and put most of the money into a \[Vanguard\] target date fund targeting when I'll be 65. It seems like that's the safest way to save a bundle of cash for retirement if I can't put it in a retirement account?

It seems like I *might* be able to convert the existing 401k money into a Roth IRA? Is that a good idea? I know that's probably a very dumb question, sorry, but I have been reading a lot and I still can't exactly tell if that's better than just leaving it as a 401k.

I should probably mention that I would *like* to buy a modest house in \~5 years, and retire at around 65. (I would be fine with *not* retiring, but I work in tech, and our people are basically unemployable after 60 unless you're an executive or a higher-up manager).

Moving from Betterment (Regular/ Not premium) taxable account &amp; Roth IRAs to Vanguard Personal Advisor services - Thoughts?,"Hello everyone! I currently manage my taxable brokerage account (General Investment goal) at Betterment that I contribute $500 monthly and a Roth IRA for $6k per year for myself and my wife on separate Betterment accounts. 

We both max out our 401ks managed through our employers, currently held in target portfolios. 

I have been looking at a personal advisor services and wondering if there is any value as we both are professionals at the early to mid stage career levels with current household income at $200k combined and expect more high incomes as we further progress in our careers. 

As someone looking at target funds or mix of index funds, would having a personal advisor make sense? Given the annual fee at Vanguard is 0.3% am tempted to try it. My thought process is if I don’t see much benefit, I can always move to digital advisor services which is equivalent to Betterment but cheaper as it is 0.2% at Vanguard compared to 0.25% at betterment. I know that I lose tax loss harvesting from the general investment account if I do this as I don’t believe Vanguard Personal advisor offers TLH yet. 

Has anyone here used/use Vanguard or other personal advisor services? If so, what advantages or use case scenarios do you find?

Donor-Advised Funds: From the POV Of Charitable Organizations?,"I'm considering setting up a Donor-Advised Fund in the future. There are a number of threads on the relative benefits of DAFs to *donors*, and I think I  appreciate most, if not all, of them. But it hasn't been as clear whether or not these funds are as favorable for the *recipients*.

From past commentary, I see two possible downsides for them:

* **Spreading Out Donations:** First, based on comments online, DAFs seem to encourage donors to spread out their donations over time. While it seems nice to be able to donate a smaller amount annual, I'm not sure that's true in practice. In this case a) I no longer receive a subsequent deduction in subsequent periods, b) the charity is worse off because they receive money over an extended period of time rather than immediately when it's most valuable, and c) donations will be anonymous so they'll have no idea whether or not I'm continuing to donate in the future.
* **Fee Structure**: Second, it seems like charitable organizations generally pay relatively high fees to liquidate the funds, which is great for the administrator (and me, who is presumably subsidized) but not great for the efficiency of the donation.

Assuming I'm trying to maximize impact, can anyone share a perspective here? Are DAFs still the way to go?  And is it preferable to fund the DAF and then fully disburse it?",0,1636943814,230,1346
Advice for how to navigate a serious debt issue,"Hello Reddit, 

It pains me to be writing these words, but I am in a very difficult spot financially and have reached a point where I need to take serious steps to pay down my debts and escape this mess as unscathed as possible, ideally in the next 3-4 years. I've researched several different courses of action and I think I have a  sense of what to do, but it would help to hear from others who may have been in a similar spot. 

Apologies in advance if this is the wrong thread for this and if I should have posted it elsewhere. 

My background story is that during Covid, I was working a government legal job in a large metropolitan area and accrued some significant credit card debt. To make matters worse, I had to help out some relatives which only compounded matters. As of this moment, I have roughly $50k in unsecured credit card debt (between Amex and Visa) and another $30k in unsecured personal loans. I also have a student loan payment running me about $500 a month. A few years ago my credit score was high 700s and it is now fluctuating from the mid to high 600s but will certainly be going lower. 

To help alleviate matters somewhat, I received a new job a few months ago and my salary went up roughly 60% to low six-figures with the possibility for a decent year end bonus. My rent is roughly $2k a month and I have a car payment of $200 along with a few other expenses. I cook a lot and rarely eat out so I've come to terms that I will be taking this to the extreme for the foreseeable future and eliminating all social expenditures. The APR % on the cards is killing me and I've never missed a payment in my life but the interest is becoming insurmountable. 

Thus far, I've researched the following options that I may need to take:

1. Debt management program
2. Debt relief program
3. Chapter 7 bankruptcy
4. Low interest balance transfer cards
5. The snowball method

At first, the debt relief programs seem very tempting but I realized that I can do exactly what they offer without the associated fees. So given everything I've laid out, the above list, the obvious need to cut expenses (spare me the reminder), I'm thinking that I need to: 

\-Immediately pay off one of my credit cards to keep that available

\-Stop payments for the unsecured personal loans

\-Contact my credit card companies to freeze my remaining accounts and negotiate a low interest payment plan so that I can to begin to slowly pay those off

Ideally, the credit card companies will come to terms on a plan so that I can pay those down in the next year or two. The unsecured loans on the other hand will likely get nasty and I'm not sure if I'll just be able to negotiate those down as well, akin to what a debt relief program might be able to do, or if they'll threaten me with litigation. I'm also fearful the credit card companies will threaten to sue me, but given my 10 year history as a customer with both and my improved income, I believe they might be more willing to come to terms.

I also looked into the balance transfer cards but I don't think I'll be approved for any given my debt levels. 

I'm not versed in bankruptcy law despite being a lawyer, but at first glance, it seems I may qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, however this presents a real risk for future employment so I would like to avoid this avenue if possible. 

In addition to these steps, I also plan on finding a few side hustles to hopefully add $1k-$2k to my income each month, even if it requires driving for Lyft. 

I understand that stopping payment on the unsecured personal loans will likely cause my credit score to plummet, but I think it could probably recover in 2-3 years as opposed to filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy which would leave a more lasting mark on my report. I'm also less concerned about the initial hit to my credit score because I don't plan on seeking a mortgage anytime in the next five years. 

This has been a numbing experience for me and it has taken its toll both mentally and physically, but I've recently changed my mental outlook and I view this as a challenge that I will overcome. I consider myself a talented lawyer and a skilled negotiator so I am up for navigating these difficult conversations which I'm bound to have. I'm also going to continue to look for a higher paying job while being entrepreneurial to generate additional income streams. 

I understand this is a lot of information to share but if anyone has been through anything similar and has advice on what are the next best steps, how to approach credit card companies, and anything else, I would appreciate some guidance. 

Thanks.",0,1636943701,835,4618
Risk-averse person needs some guidance on what to do with savings,"Hey all, a little background - I'm a 41 year old single male making around $115K a year in NYC. I have no debt and been working since right out of college and been max contributing to my 401K for quite some time, and currently have $370K there. The bigger issue is that I have $160K sitting in savings doing absolutely nothing. I'm admittedly pretty naive in most money matters and have taken to ""hoarding"" earnings in a savings rather than risk any loss that my lack of knowledge might result in. All I'm looking to do is handle that money in a smarter/more financially responsible way.

HDHP vs PPO Insurance Decision,"I am trying to figure out which employee health plan would be a better option for me. I am relatively young and healthy, but still use medical insurance somewhat regularly for standard stuff. The two options I am between are:

First, I absolutely love me jeep. It fits my personality and “needs” perfectly. I love having off road capabilities but they really aren’t necessary if I’m being honest. My uncle said he would buy back the jeep for about $4k. 

Second, I would have to take a loan out to buy the vehicle. I do have money saved but it is invested and really don’t want to touch it. I have about $2k in a taxable account and about $3k in a Roth IRA. I contribute a little over $500 a month to my Roth and have recently started to contribute $150 a month to my 401(k). 

I have about a 770 credit score

Ongoing benefit of early direct deposit?,"My CU recently announced they're going to start doing early direct deposit.  That's fine, but several people I've talked to are freaking ecstatic about it... and I don't get it.  I've seen every startup banking up hyping early direct deposit as a major feature, and I don't see how it's such a massive benefit.  

Getting a deposit on Wednesday instead of Friday doesn't seem like a game-changer to me.  Granted, I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, so I'm not broke going into payday, but even if I was, getting paid two days early seems like it would only help the first time.  After that, you're still getting paid every two weeks; It's just every other Wednesday vs. every other Friday.  

If you need the money on the first Wednesday and can't wait until Friday, great.  That's a benefit to you... that first time.  After that, you're still going two weeks between each deposit.  

Am I missing something?  This doesn't seem like a major benefit to me.",0,1636942762,176,957

Any advice for personal online sales looking to transition into offical business?," Hi,

My friend and I have been selling items online for the past 3 weeks. The project started small so I set up my personal bank account to receive a few hundred dollars. Now we are close to $13k in profit and all that has been wired into my personal account.

We are now looking to put all the profit to start a small business--computer rental--and looking to spend most on purchasing computers, but I am pretty lost and could use some pointers on how to go about this.

1. Should I set aside money for personal taxes on that $13k or spend everything on the new business venture?
2. Can I pay for the computers with my personal money right now and still get tax deducted when I file for a small business?
3. Any general tips/advice would be greatly appreciated!

What should I do if I co-inherit land that I don’t want?,"Sorry if this is a misleading title, allow me to explain. My father has a traditional IRA with about 300k in it. He just told me today that he is planning on buying land (not sure where just yet), and that he would leave it in my brother (30yo) and I’s (34yo) names. The land he is planning to buy is likely to be used as a hunting and fishing camp. I am by no means a hunter and while I do fish, I don’t want to have to go out of my way to this camp to fish. **How would you handle inheriting land that you don’t necessarily want?**

Also as a sort of side question - my dad said he plans to invest in this land some sort of way because if he takes the money directly out of his IRA, he will be taxed on it (which I understand as it’s a traditional IRA). **Is there a way he can purchase this land using his IRA without that money being subject to taxes?**",0,1636942182,175,857
"28, daca recipient wanting a change in life in the u.s. really tired of labor jobs.","I'll start by giving a little bit of background about myself and my situation at the moment. I'm 28 living in the United States under daca after being brought here by my parents at age 4. My parents are also illegal, hard working parents. For the last 10 years of my life since I graduated high school I have been drafting/programming cnc machine for woodworking. 

I really need a change of life. I dont know where else to post this. I have 500 dollars to my name and the dream of being able to go to school one day to finally end the cycle of poverty in my family. My parents use my social for a business they have for reselling merchandise and I was also making around 30k a year for the last 3 years of me working. 

My parents are getting older and I need to start taking over the reigns. I would like to either become a barber or a programmer on a front end sql type of language and im currently learning how to use python and excel to handle my finances better. 

I'm at my witts end, I have depression and anxiety due to this and I'm just hoping someone with better knowledge of what I can do might shed some info on this. I feel like at 28 there isn't much I can do in terms of getting help to go back to school in California.

Advice about buying a car,"My car is dead in the water and reached a point in its 14 year old that it's no longer worth it to pour the money into repairs. It is paid for and I can appreciate the advice that would suggest I'm still better off without a car payment, but I'm done with worrying about it and not being able to depend on it. It is earlier than I'd have liked to try to get a car due to not being in the place credit wise I'd like to be, but I'm gonna try to see how I might work it out anyway.

So here's my position:

1. 28 y.o. nurse with a credit rating approx 550-635 depending on which free credit service you check. I suspect that the actual credit agencies aren't caught up to that, if I understand that correctly. 

2. I have a fair amount of credit debt, and I need to recover my emergency fund. However, in mid Dec I expect a 10000$ bonus from work that I will use to eliminate 70-80% of my credit debt, put 1000 in a savings account to restart my emergency fund, and then the rest for a sizeable down payment on a car. I could pay 100% of my credit but I wouldn't be able to have a 1000 savings, and to me I'd rather have that and take literally only one more month to make it zero. This plan will put me at 30% usage or less on all my credit. 

3. Per my budget I can afford the payment that a new car would entail of about 350$ max. I expect to put 4000 for dish payment, but I'm aware that my credit rating won't catch up to my pay off, and my interest rate will run as much as 12-17%. This is where I get held up. 

I want to consider what options exist to minimize the effect the car purchase will have on me long term. Whatever I can do to promote the best financial future with the car in mind, because once my credit is paid off I'll be back on track in other ways.

 Since my car is otherwise not usable and I am a single adult who will have to borrow from friends or get uber or rides, it's my opinion that getting a car is the best choice. Ideally I'd prefer to get something small, four years old or less, with low mileage. Some of my research suggests that there are possible options for me in those cases, but I understand that my credit may be what hoses me here. 

Would I be wise to pursue this plan and take the hit from a potentially high interest rate? Could I refinance it later when my credit is much better? What about trading it in before its paid off for another newer used car in the future when my credit is better, how does that work? Would I be better than to get an older crummy but functional car for now and do that later? What about leasing short term and then buying when my credit jumps?

I have not yet used my free credit pull on myself, but i watch my credit close with credit karma and experian. Any advice helps.",0,1636939905,547,2748
Best steps to prepare for coming changes,"I'm a high school teacher- at least I will be for the next couple of weeks. I submitted my resignation last month to allow the school time to hopefully find a replacement. My job had truly become unbearable and unhealthy, and my family situation is such that I need a bit more flexibility than education allows. At the same time, it's a job that is not easy to leave- especially in the spring term, since I teach a tested subject.

Luckily, I will have a few paychecks coming in when I leave because they'll owe me the money that was withheld to cover summer pay. But, as of now, I do not have another job lined up, so I'm expecting at least a few months of being unemployed.

We have enough savings to cover about six months of normal expenses, and I plan to pick up some gig work while I'm looking. I'll luckily also pay off my car before I leave, and I've already started networking, building a portfolio for a career switch, etc. I'm feeling cautiously optimistic about the coming changes.

First Time Using Credit,"Hi, I'm personally new to this subreddit.

For some background, I'm 19 and I've gotten a credit card for the first time. The thing is, I'm a bit confused on some aspects of using a credit card.

I've heard the term ""credit utilization"" being tossed around and that below 10% is considered best if you want a higher credit limit.

Right now, my credit limit is $300.  
From my understanding, if I only use $30 out of my available $300 credit limit, it is considered a 10% credit utilization. But if I spend $150 and pay $120 before they report my statement balance so that my current balance is $30, that is also considered a 10% credit utilization also?

I've also heard that 1% credit utilization is optimal.

I don't have a credit score and would like to build up good credit as quickly as I can. I know that this is one important aspect of building credit, but if there are more important aspects, I would love to know.

Trying to figure out next steps for future financial security.,"Just looking for advice on next steps. Here's some background:

I'm currently in my early twenties and have around 75k in savings accounts with 5k in investment accounts. My car is paid off, and I have no student loans or CC debt. I have a credit score around 790, I pay $775 in rent, and I was fortunate to find an apartment that includes utilities. I just opened a Roth IRA earlier this year when I became a contract employee to circumnavigate the issue of not having a 401k. That being said, based on what I currently make, (around $800 a week after tax), I've been putting $400 a month into my IRA. when I set the account up, I wasn't sure how much I would end up making, but I'm unsure of how much I should really be putting in in case of emergency. I realize that comes out to only $4,800 a year. I'm fortunate to be in an industry I really enjoy and I'm in no rush to retire super early. I've been considering purchasing an electric vehicle in cash to mitigate gas and traditional maintenance costs, but I often read here that dumping money into a car is a poor choice - especially when it would set me back half of my savings.

My big questions are:

What else should I be doing to set myself up for financial security in the future?

Should I open a traditional IRA in addition to my Roth for the sake of tax benefits?

I'm assuming I know the answer to this, but is buying an EV just an absolute waste of money right now considering I have a vehicle paid off and in working order? I'd like to have a car I could keep for the next 14-16 years.

Is there anything I can do to further utilize my savings to work to my advantage?

mid life family blending,"My GF and I are moving in together and need to figure out how to deal with finances.  We're both divorced, in our 40s, and don't want to make any relationship mistakes this time around.  I'd like r/personalfinance opinion on many of the different problems we need to solve before we commit to a prenup.  Similar questions have been answered here years ago, but our last items seem unique.

&amp;#x200B;

We want everything financial to be as separate as possible this time.  We don't want any resentment to build if one were to prioritize saving for a trip while the other wanted to buy something frivolous like a robot vacuum in the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever transportation we pick will be 100% the domain of the driver.  Unless we decide we need a minivan to deal with our large blended family, in which case that would be a shared expense.

&amp;#x200B;

I earn more than she does, so we intend to split expenses (food, electrical, internet, etc) proportionally instead of 50/50.  This would be based on each person's net income, not gross, including the child support I pay and the child support she is supposed to receive.  Seems fair, right?

&amp;#x200B;

One potential complication is it looks like she will need to take her ex to court to have him actually pay.  Even though it is black and white she is unsure if she will do this as she isn't sure of the emotional impact this will have on her children.  Currently we are counting this income, even though it doesn't exist.  Our view is she chooses not to take what the law gives her she is effectively giving that portion of ""our"" money to her ex and it would be unfair to take that away from my ability to put savings away for my kids to go to university.  This is fair, right?  FWIW I 100% paid for our blended family vacation the last two years.  I'm 100% fine with that choice, but it would've been nice if she was able to help pay so I could contribute more to my own kids' future as she continues to save money for her kids' education.

&amp;#x200B;

We both have investments.  I have some money set aside in stocks for retirement and she has her union pension.  It seems obvious to these separate, right?

&amp;#x200B;

She brings a townhouse asset which she is now renting out.  She has owned this long enough that it is slightly cash positive.  We'll keep her ownership of this 100% for her, but net income from it counts toward her net income.  This seems fair, right?

&amp;#x200B;

The complicated item is my house.  She would like this to be our house, even though for her she keeps 100% of her house as investment.  We'll split ownership as the amount I have already paid, and she will pay a percentage of the mortgage based on our net income.  When this is finished she'll end up with around 25% ownership of the house.  This seems like a reasonable way to split, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have any idea would retirement could look like?  If the house was 75% mine and 25% hers do we just ignore the difference or do we draw out of her retirement money more?  We haven't discussed this yet.  I would love advice on this.  I lean toward spending her money first as she will get a fixed income pension and the longer my investments compound the more we will have.

&amp;#x200B;

The final complication is my house has a mortgage helper.  We will directly offset the mortgage by this amount to make our mortgage payments smaller.  e.g. $3k month mortgage - $1k in rent = $2k for us to split, roughly $800 her and $1200 me.  Is this right as if I owned a separate condo then it would be 100% mine, like her house she is now renting.  It seems like she is coming out slightly ahead, but yet is completely fair as she has to live with the noise and smells from a shared property.

Currently in the market for a home and I’m not entirely sure which home type would be the best for me financially or if I should even move into my own home right now. I’ve been leaning towards condos but HOA fees are about as much as mortgages on their own, so I’m not sure if that’s the best way to go, however, I like the small size of a condo and the lower amount of responsibility it takes to maintain them. I have been hearing talks about a possible housing market crash in the coming months, so I’m not sure if I should hold out until then to get a house for cheaper (as interest rates start to rise and homeowners start selling their houses).

Here’s some things to consider:

&amp;#x200B;

* 23 years old currently living at home with parents
* Make $70k annually and $2k a check, $4k a month
* Have 4% of check going into 401k before taxes
* $13,500 in student loans that I have to start paying in January
* $5k in credit card debt
* $17,900 car loan, paying around $295 a month on it (Old car had 300,000+ miles and went up on me so ended up getting a hybrid that is more fuel efficient)
* $18k in investments (fluctuates substantially)

Which home type would be best for me financially? Or should I just sit tight and wait for a better opportunity and pay down my debt in the meantime?

Does increasing inflation change your views on a sizable emergency fund or where it should be kept?,"Background: Wife and I are solidly upper middle class. Secure, good-paying jobs and well-funded 401(k) plans. Currently we have a 6-month emergency fund stashed away in a bank account. We also have a “fun money” account that we deposit bonuses, tax refunds, etc. into to pay for vacations, home improvements, etc.  I can’t help but feel like, with rising inflation, the emergency fund is just slowly throwing money away.

Inherited Retirement Account,"Hi Everyone!

I am looking for some advice and if my way of thinking is flawed.

So earlier this year my mom passed away and left me a small retirement account ~ 70K. When I withdraw the money it is taxed at my income level. I am currently making ~62k and expect a 10k + raise around April next year. I am wanting to pull the money out strategically and have already pulled out about 18k to help pay for renovations on her home which I will be selling soon. I would like to pull out about 30k and use it to fund day trading. 

Where I would like some input is would it be smart to pull out a big chunk in 2021 and the rest in 2022. I know this will increase my taxes in the short term but my thinking is as time goes on I will be making more and more so I will be getting taxed regardless. If I pull out more now I can put the money to work for me with day trading and the rest into ETFs. 

Am I better off pulling it all out in the next few months and investing/trading or would waiting and only pulling out small chunks over the next 4-5 years be better. 

Thanks!",0,1636935259,215,1066

Negotiating surgery bills within deductible?,"Broke my collarbone a few weeks ago and I'm getting surgery for it on Tuesday. It's being done at an surgery center instead of a hospital, and they'll be charging me $5,400 before the surgeon and anesthesiologist fees. They're claiming they can accept 60% upfront the day before surgery, and that they receive payment upfront because they're much cheaper than having the procedure done at a hospital.

I have a deductible of $7,000 with a plan through the ACA. With the initial emergency room visit, ortho visits and CT scan, I'm more than certain that I'll hit my deductible when this is all said and done. 

Right now I'm trying to figure out the payment options. I could do CareCredit and finance the surgery over 12 months. Or, if we pay the 60%, my wife believes that we could possibly negotiate the 40% surgery cost on the back end. Does it seem likely that they would be willing to negotiate?

I don’t know what to do next with my money - early 20s,"I’m in my early 20s. My income is $112k + stocks from my employer which I average about $120 +/- $5k a year. I put $19,500 a year into a 401k and $500 a month into a Roth IRA. I also put in 15% of my income into ESPP (and I get a 15% discount). I always sell the ESPP right away. I have $10k in savings, and am expecting 43 shares of company stock (valued at $180 per share = $7,740) and will be soon able to sell my ESPP shares which usually amounts to $6,000. So by next month I will be raking in an extra $14k. 

6 months of expenses for me (not counting Roth IRA and eating out and stuff) is $21,000. So I would have $24,000 in emergency fund so I would want to invest the rest of the $3k.

I am able to save an extra $1k per month outside of my Roth IRA and 401k maxing. I tend to spend $7k - $10k a year on vacations (I like to travel a lot. And I’m young so this “luxury” is important to me). If I don’t take as many vacations in a year I can probably save more than $1k a month outside of retirement. My employer also offers something called a mega backdoor Roth IRA. However, I don’t know if I want so much tied up in retirement. 

My next steps I was considering saving for a house down payment. But I wouldn’t look for a house until my late 20s early 30s. In the meantime I want to try living in other cities. But I do know I want to eventually settle down in Seattle where I live. So I need to start saving now because median home price is $900k here. 

Is saving for a house a good next step? Tbh I’m not great with money because I never had someone teach me how to handle it. My 401k is in a 0.08% target date fund which might be a bit conservative with 10% bonds. My Roth IRA is in VTWAX.

Sanity check on budget for high earners starting a family in VHCOL area?,"I was wondering if I could get the PF hive mind's view on a preliminary budget for my family. I've never really made a budget before. My fiancée and I are early-mid 30s and want to buy in our VHCOL area and start a family soon. This is a sketch of what our finances might look at in a few years after we've had Kid #1.

I have TC of around \~$200k in a demanding, high-upside career track I've recently started on (quite possible I could be making double+ in 3-4 years, though I might also decide I like seeing my kids more). Fiancee is making \~$450k in a very niche line of work that she's spectacularly good at, with growth potential harder to estimate since it's not a common track; she could make $1m or she could make a lot less if she cuts down on her hours when kids come along. 

We're currently renting a 2BR for about \~5k but are looking into buying a 3-4BR when kids come along. Following is a very rough estimate of a budget in a few years' time:

&amp;#x200B;

Gross combined income	$650,000

2x maxed traditional 401(k)	$41,000

Taxable income	$609,000

Est net combined income standard deduction)	$360,000

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Housing monthly\*\*

1.75m 30-year fixed mortgage at 2.75%	$7,144

Common charges, property tax, etc	$5,000 (rough estimate)

Fudge factor for minor repairs, doorman tips, etc	$500 (very rough estimate)

Total monthly housing spend	$12,644

Annual housing spend	$151,728

Net income less housing	$208,272

	

\*\*Other monthly necessities\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Nanny/child care per month	$3,000

Food cost per month assuming no cooking	$1,500

Internet, phones, utilities	$300

Groceries etc	$250

Necessary transportation (we won't have a car)	$300

2x backdoor Roth IRA	$1,000

&amp;#x200B;

Healthcare (I get amazing, nearly free coverage via my employer) $15

Monthly necessities spend	$6,365

Annual necessities spend	$76,380

	

	

Desired savings of 20% of take-home(?)	$72,000

	

Fun money (vacations, entertainment, shopping, decor, charity, etc)	$59,892

&amp;#x200B;

Do these numbers seem plausible? Anything unreasonably low or high, and am I leaving out any major categories? I should mention that we don't have any debt aside from the future mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

Some follow-up questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Net savings (401(k) + backdoor Roth + taxable brokerage + paying off principal on home) come to \~$160k, or about 1/4 of pre-tax income - is this a good level? I do feel like making this much money is kind of pointless if you're not actually building wealth. I should mention that neither my fiancee nor I have all that much in assets as we were not high earners in our 20s.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I would like to start giving a substantial amount to charity before too long. We would be close to the point where charity + mortgage interest would be larger than than the standard deduction so charity would be deductible, right?

&amp;#x200B;

3. Obviously \~$60k is more than enough in fun money in an absolute sense. Is it a reasonable amount for someone in our overall situation? I am really pretty non-materialistic but my fiancée does like spending her own money on designer stuff.",0,1636932420,462,3151
"Absolute noobs, options overwhelming.","Hi reddit - I'm trying to do my due diligence, but all of the investing options and debt recommendations are overwhelming. Please halp!

&amp;#x200B;

Wife and I are both about to turn 40, and due to some family related issues along the way we have done a somewhat poor job of saving/planning based on our income. Those issues have finally been resolved, and we are looking to re-focus and come up with an actual plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Details:

We live in a very high cost of living city, but thanks to a family member's generosity we currently have an awesome rental which keeps our monthly rent far lower than comparable home ownership would be. (we pay 2500/mo for a unit that would be worth 2+mil to purchase). This situation could end sometime in the next 1-2 years, so we're preparing for the idea of purchasing, and we'd likely look to move to a slightly lower cost area when that happens.

Here's our stats:

Gross yearly income: 250k.

401k: 235k.

Plain old savings account: 110k.

Car loan: 17.5k @ 2.99

Student loans: 67k @ 3.5

&amp;#x200B;

total monthly spend including min payments on both loans: \~7 - 7.5k. The rest goes to savings / vacations / shit like that. We like to eat out and shop a bit and do fun things, and the chance of us becoming ""rice and beans"" types is practically zero. So we're hoping to come up with a realistic plan that we can actually achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

Non ER medical bills,"Looking for advice on how/if I can appeal 2 bills I received in anyway.

\-Developed a really bad sciatica issue a few months back to the point where I can't stand on my feet longer than 30 minutes. For that reason I literally just couldn't work.

\-After a couple days, I visited my Primary care doctor to figure out what was going on (I only got a physical done there and a recommendation). He's only a primary care doctor so in figuring out what the extent of the problem was, he recommended I go to another doctor office that specializes in back problems.

I went to the specialist and they had an x-ray done on me. I then in the same place after the x-ray, spoke with a doctor from that location. X-ray looked fine,  he prescribed me some medication that didn't help at all, and told me I should get an MRI to see what I'm dealing with. I told him that it's very likely sciatica just from what I've read up on. That doctor then recommended me to go get an MRI done. They recommended a couple places that had an MRI machine and so I picked one.

Went to get the MRI, no issues with anything else up until both bills came in the mail.

The specialist place charged me 1200$, 750 for being an outpatient and 500 for the x-ray.

The MRI bill came in for $4500.

Being that I'm still currently dealing with this problem and it's getting worse as opposed to recovering, I physically can't see myself being able to do my job again. That leads me to an issue where I have $300 to my name and $6,000 to pay off.

After seeing these bills and thinking back on the stuff that I did, I probably fucked up big time by not putting in any claims, or doing a fair amount of research for that matter.

1) Take RMDs using the life expectancy table of the primary beneficiary knowing that the account will not be depleted any time soon (principal 200k), life expectancy factor this year about 21. This will subject future RMDs to highest bracket marginal income tax in 5 years, but allow tax deferred growth over the life of the account

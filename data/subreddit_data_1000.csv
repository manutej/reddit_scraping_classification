0,Mortgage Lender Requiring Additional Down Payment and Buying Points for Mortgages Under a Certain Amount - Is this Common Practice in the Industry?,"Someone I know is looking to purchase a condo for 90k. The lender said that they had to put 25% down and had to purchase points. Their reasoning is that this small of a loan is ""riskier"" and that this is common practice in the industry for loans under 150k. I have never heard of that being common practice - is it? Note: The loan would be an investment loan, however they said this was common for any conventional loan of that size.",personalfinance,1636752649
1,Metro Bank refusing to clear funds (UK),"Apologies if this is the wrong sub don't know where to post. My cousin was working for a delivery company for 6 months and did not get paid this whole time (20k). I've written a very condensed timeliness of events below. Please can someone advise.

Company did not pay wages for 6months (20k) - he raised complaint with ACAS
A few months later they paid full sum into his account at metro
When he tries to access the money its not in there, account frozen and money in ""holding"" 
Metro won't tell him why for like a year
Finally tell him he was being investigated for fraud as it was such a large lump sum and money will be accessible on Monday (this was Dec last year)
Money is not there on Monday
Every week since they've been promising the money will be released but it isn't
He's also had his wages from a new job paid in to a barclays which was also frozen. Upon being cleared of fraud he   closed barclays account and moved everything to metro
Metro will not let him access any money at all despite being cleared of fraud
During this time he has raised multiple complaints with the ombudsman so the total amount owed now is missing wages + new wages + compensation to a total of 60k
Then he tells us that the boss who owed him wages has been convicted of using  bank account to launder money to a foreign country. Cousin also said he was supposed to be a witness at the trial but didn't go (didn't say why)
He's not been able to access his new wages (paid after unfreeze of account) from his job because he opened a new account, transferred the wages over, but then his card never arrived because the FedEx  driver was ill and metro would send a new one - this was like 3 months ago
Now bank is saying they cleared the 60k last week but it didn't go through because it was such a large sum. They are now going to clear 30k Monday and 30k the Monday after that
Cousin has said once it's cleared he will withdraw in cash the entire 60k 
My dad tweeted metro bank complaining but took it down as my cousin didn't give his permission 

Please can someone advise I am literally at a loss",personalfinance,1636752601
2,"$9000+ damage to car, refusal to pay agreed upon amount. How do I proceed?","This incident occurred this past June, 2021 and I am not sure how to proceed. The person who damaged my car refuses to pay the agreed upon amount.

I was working as a groundsman for a tree service company this past Summer. One of my co-workers had a side gig clearing a property of trees that I was helping him with, it was cash under the table pay. There was a backhoe that we used to remove stumps and shape the land. I was on the other side of the property felling a tree when he hollered my name. He said that he damaged my car by hitting with the arm of the backhoe accidently. We went to look at it and the roof was dented with a deep scrape the whole length, the windshield cracked, and the retractable glass sunroof was smashed and broken with the frame was bent to hell. The homeowner and his wife were there and saw the damage. Neither of them suggested filing a claim with their homeowners insurance or the insurance on the backhoe. I did not inquire with them because I was unaware I could do that.

My Co-worker and I talked about how to proceed with either going through insurance or a cash settlement. Neither of us wanted to go through insurance (mistake 1) and decided to settle it for cash. The estimate from the autobody repair shop was over $9000, my car was worth (pre-damage) just under $4000. I am not a greedy person, and I didn't want to break his bank, so, we agreed that he would pay me $2000 over the course of a month in $500 payments; we shook hands and made the deal (mistake 2).

I approached him multiple times over the next 3 months about paying me what we agreed upon, but he kept saying that he would get it to me, he just didn't have the money to do it. I had been pleasant and diplomatic to this point and was getting nowhere. I finally sent him a text letting him know I was getting angry and when he was going to pay me.

It boiled down to him refusing to pay due to his being angry with me for an unrelated event that occurred at our official job with the tree service company where I reported him for him breaking company policy and endangering the lives of myself and the others on the crew. I have the text message he sent me saved. 

I am wondering if I should just forget about him and go to the homeowner about filing a claim against their homeowners insurance. I worry that I have waited too long to take action on this and am looking for ways to proceed.",personalfinance,1636752589

4,Help with my investment strategy,"Hello,   
I am a 25M, and I have started working 2 years ago. I have decided to invest my money, as currently most of my money is in my checking account, doing absolutely nothing. 

I've read about possible ways of investing, done the essential steps, and have a solid plan in place. This is after all my debts are clear, and I have enough rent for the next 3 months. I already contribute to my 401k, the max that my employer matches.

Right now, I have $40k of unused money in my bank account. I plan to use this money by splitting this into 3 parts: 

1. Emergency Funds: Going to put $10k into a savings account. This is incase I lose my job, get in an accident etc. This is around 5-6 months at my current lifestyle.
2. High Risk Funds: Going to use $5k to make a few high risk investments. This is mostly going to be cryptocurrency, as I am fascinated by this. I am willing to lose this money to gain more experience. 
3. Low Risk Finds: I plan to put $2k/month($1k from my salary, and $1k from my checking account) into VOO every month over the course of 2 years. This should prevent something like a huge fall in the fund from taking all my assets with it. 

I had two questions about this plan: 

1. Is this a good plan for now? 
2. I am planning to move to a different country(I want to move to Europe, specifically Netherlands and settle down there in the future), whenever I can get a job there. I know I will not be trying for the next 2 years as I need experience and I already have a job, but when I do what happens to my investments? I don't want to have to pay a heavy tax twice on all my investments or something similar happening. I haven't put any money in my Roth IRA this year for this very reason, and I am kind of confused.",personalfinance,1636752471
5,"23 YO, Sit on Cash or put into Bonds/HYS","Hello all,

I have $5k in an emergency account and $20k sitting in another savings account. I want to purchase a house within the next 1-3 years (depending on the market) although I don't know when that time may arise. 

I'm not saving anymore and all of my extra funds go into crypto which currently sits at around $8k. I also have an HSA and tax account but for all intents and purposes, I won't include those.

My main concern is inflation and my thought process would be to put this $20k into Ibonds so I'm getting the 7% rather than losing to inflation.

Is there a better place to put this $20k? Or would it be wise to keep it in the bank if an opportunity in Real Estate were to come around?",personalfinance,1636752443

10,Need to sell my car to move out of the country and need some advice,"Hello everyone,

On December I will move out of the country. For this I need to sell my car and was planning to sell it to a dealership since I need the process done quickly. The car is a used 2018 Hyundai Elantra that I bought one year ago for 15k. Right now I owe 11.7k, and the current car value per Kelley's Blue Book is 14k. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Dealership I bought it from is a Hyundai dealer also. I talked to them and they are willing to buy the car from me. However, I don't want to pay one cent for the car on the sale, which they compromised to. They would do all the process, since my loan is with Hyundai Motor Finance (HMF), and will make the process through them. This is convenient for me,  since it takes responsibility out of my hands, however I know dealerships have all the tricks to financially mess someone, and I don't want to fall on one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Going to the point, I want to sell the car to the dealership, they make all the process through Hyundai ensuring I don't pay one cent, but if the car value is more than what I owe, how does it works to get that excess value paid to me? Do they pay the extra value on cash or check to me, and the remaining to HMF? Do I get the whole check and make the process myself? Should I consider going to another dealership? 

&amp;#x200B;

I need and easy process, $0 lost, and if applicable, getting that excess amoutn for the price.

18,Dumb beginner question about PMI v MPI,"I recently bought my first house using an FHA loan with PMI due to low down payment. My question is, do I need to consider MPI? My parents (who would be in charge of my ""estate"" if something happened to me feel I need it, I don't due to the reasons below.

1. I have more than enough life insurance to pay all after death expenses including paying off the mortgage if they want to keep the house.

2. From my understanding, if I would pass, and they don't want the house, the mortgage would not by default transfer to them. The only way they would have to worry about it is if they wanted to keep the house for some reason, and in that case, they could use a portion of the life insurance to purchase the house from the bank.


Am I wrong about this and should I look into MPI or is that unnecessary?",personalfinance,1636750073

20,How to best negotiate a pay increase because of importance/criticality,"I currently work as an engineer in manufacturing at a pretty large company. They’ve been good about annual pay increases to keep me ahead of inflation and I’ve been promoted once as well since I started working for the company a few years ago. I know that I am currently below the median pay at my experience level and role, but up until now I felt that I was at a pretty reasonable pay-to-effort ratio. 

Around the time of my last pay increase (~3 months ago to adjust for inflation), I was selected to manage a high priority project for the company that will deliver significant value. The value is only available for a short period of time so the faster the project is online the more money the company makes. 

Throughout the process, I’ve been hit with significant obstacles out of my control but the project timeline hasn’t changed. This has created a significant amount of work that I have to do in order to make everything happen on the timeline I’ve been given. This has resulted in me going from a typical 45-50 hour work week to constant 60-70 hour weeks and oftentimes weekend work. There aren’t any additional resources available to help out with the added workload for me. 

With my knowledge of the project and where it is all at, me leaving the role would almost definitely result in huge delays to the project and lots of lost opportunity/money for the company. I know that I’m a key player in providing this money and I would like to see this through to the end, but I don’t feel that the work I’m doing is appropriate for below average pay. Is there a good way to approach my boss with this without looking as if I’m threatening the project? He’s receptive to my feedback a lot of the time but I’m not sure that I would have a successful negotiation without being prepared. Any help?

* About to acquire a yearly 3% increase, but my hourly rate is capped at $24.00/hr.
* Two personal days, eight sick days, 15 vacation days and two floating holidays w/a use-it-or-lose-it policy
* 401k matched dollar-for-dollar up to 6% w/profit sharing
* Medical, dental and vision health coverage, supplemental insurance, short term and long term disability coverage
* Varied days and hours (0900-2100) based upon scheduling and on call 24/7

**Job B (offer)**

* $50,000.00 salaried
* Possible yearly increase
* 128 hrs. of PTO (16 days) with 40 hrs. (five days) of rollover year-to-year
* 75% matched 401k after 90 days w/profit sharing after one year
* Medical, dental and vision health coverage, supplemental and whole life insurance, short and long term disability coverage, accident, critical illness and pet insurance
* 0800-1630 M-F w/weekends off and on call 24/7

I received a job offer one day after one interview with three members from the hiring team and rejected the initial offer because of the starting salary ($47,500.00). I was then contacted by HR and was able to negotiate my starting salary to $50,000.00. However, I was told amidst negotiation, that my salary was going to be increased to the negotiated offer after six months and the terms were accidentally not placed into the initial offer letter. The new job would also force me to relocate two hours east and I factored in cost of living (less) from where I currently live to the new location. However, I currently rent an apartment and the lease breakage fee is $2,800.00 and I would have had to eventually acquire new residence upon relocation. The timeline for the correspondence between myself and HR is as follows:

* Interviewed
* Received initial offer one day later
* Rejected job offer four (two business) days later
* Contacted by HR one day after the rejection and negotiated salary 
* Contacted by HR two days after the negotiation and was told that I needed to accept the new offer in one days' time or else it would be rescinded
* Rejected the negotiated offer the next day and was told ""good luck"" by HR via email
* Total of eight (six business) days from start to finish

24,Opinions on whether you would continue to rent or sell (BDA),"I have a condo in Bermuda with about 270K left to pay off on the mortgage. Monthly mortgage payments are 2400 with around 1800 in quarterly maintenance payments and whatever Govt tax is at the end of the year.

I've had it rented out for about 10 years now with the rental price actually increasing over that trend. The current lease is signed for 2 year (starting past Oct) and is for $5000 a month. 

I estimate the selling price would be around 625K - 675K. 

I've always thought of the place as my retirement fund that will have it's mortgage paid off right around the time I retire (I'm 40ish) and will garner me the extra income in rent as my living expenses. 

There are several threats to that of course - obviously there are no guarantees that it will continue it's great rental income return, and there could be a time where there are no occupants as well as there is always a chance of a renovation or fix that will garner a large expense. All of that is additional stress as if the place wasn't rented for a month, I wouldn't be able to afford the mortgage payment. I now live in the US and don't make enough to save (we live month to month on credit card float). I am the single earner in the family. The additional income that it makes in BDA will occasionally come over to the US on which we pay tax and transfer fees on. 

I just don't know whether it's smart to try and hold on to it and endure the stress, or try to sell it now and reinvest the proceeds. It looks like I'd get around 300K in returns if all goes well. I could either pay off a large chunk of my current house (currently 368K) or just save/invest it.

29,"Having trouble opening a bank account for a ""subtrust"" to collect inheritance","My son just received inheritance from my wife's grand aunt. Great right? Well, we are having some first world problems trying to collect it.

TLDR: Banks are saying they've never heard of a ""subtrust"" before and are requiring a standalone trust document that does not exist, we need to understand options.

now the too-long for those interested:

The great aunt passed away (in NY) after having created a trust to manage a portion of her estate, the trust being called the Jane Doe 2019 Revocable Trust. That trust names my son, John Doe (in MA) as a beneficiary to receive $XX,XXX, but contains this clause: **""In the event that a beneficiary shall become entitled to receive a portion or all of the Trust estate and shall not have attained the age of twenty-five (25) years, then his or her said share of the Trust estate shall be held IN FURTHER TRUST, to be administered, invested reinvested and distributed in accordance with paragraphs (1) through (4) hereinbelow:""** It then goes on to describe the conditions of that trust.

The eldercare law firm who prepared the Jane Doe 2019 Revocable Trust, sent us this information along with an application to file for an EIN for a new trust, which is called the ""John Doe Subtrust under the Jane Doe 2019 Revocable Trust"". OK, fair enough, we literally have no idea what we are doing, so we complete that, receive an SS-4 from the IRS and the Trustee of the Jane Doe 2019 Revocable Trust mails us the check for $XX,XXX, which is made payable to the John Doe Subtrust.

So, now what do we do? We go to our local BOA office where we have checking and savings and hand our folder of info over, asking for assistance opening an account for the Subtrust so we can deposit the check. Small problem, they have never heard of a ""subtrust"" before. They call legal dept, ask for the trust document. Well we gave that, its the Jane Doe 2019 blah blah document. Nope, they need the trust document for the John Doe Subtrust. We call the firm that prepared the Trust and they say there is no separate document for the Subtrust, it is self-contained in the Jane Doe trust within paragraphs 1-4, referenced in the excerpt above.

At this point the BOA people ghost us, literally not returning calls/emails so we start over from scratch at a regional bank thinking they will be more interested in working through some complexity to own the account. The regional bank also has never heard of a subtrust but runs it up to legal and gets back the following: **""We can only accept a trust within a trust if the sub trust is specifically named in the trust doc. The Trust is not specifically named in this document so we would require a separate trust document for the sub trust.""**

We read this statement back to the estate lawyer who makes a fair point that the clause referenced above is conditional upon the beneficiary being below a certain age and so there is no reason for the Trust document to specifically name the Subtrust, but that the conditions of the trust are nonetheless described in full in paragraphs 1-4, and the actual name of the John Doe Subtrust declares itself to BE a subtrust of the Jane Doe 2019 Trust.

So, monkey in the middle, we bounce this reply back to the regional bank but they say, sorry, its a matter of policy the subtrust MUST be specifically named in the trust and suggest perhaps NY law and MA law vary.

So, what do we do now? Do we really need the subtrust to BE a subtrust? Can we just make a trust independently and have the language be consistent with the stipulations from the Jane Doe Trust? Do we need to hire a lawyer? My head is spinning just typing this up.",personalfinance,1636748103

There’s probably about $15k in there. In order to make sure I can keep going to school without piling on debt of my own, I’ve tried to ask my school to if I can pay for my next semester in advance and they said no. Is there any way I can keep my college fund safe while my dad files for bankruptcy? Could he give the money to me in a check to put in my account?

The weird part is she’s not allowed to contribute, which means we are unable to take advantage of the max $19500 tax benefit. Plus our MAGI should allow her to have tax deductible Trad IRA assuming she is NOT in a qualified retirement plan. 403b is a qualified plan AFAIK but with her not being able to contribute her own money, does it actually count?

39,When does a back-door ROTH conversion make sense?,"I am probably going to be retire in the next 2-3 years, in my late 50's.

My wife (already retired, approx same age) and I have done pretty good with our 401(k) and roll-over Traditional IRAs. Both of us will be getting pensions starting at 65, and then file for Social Security at 70. We live in Washington State (no income tax).

Our combined Social Security + Pensions will almost certainly push us over the thresholds where 85% of benefits will be taxable, and when we hit the RMDs of 72, it will be a certainty. 

Should I be trying convert our 401k/Traditional IRAs to (backdoor) ROTHs to avoid RMDs?  If I did them all at once, it would push me into the 37% bracket, but my nominal bracket during retirement will most likely otherwise be 22% (which is also my current working bracket).  I will have significant headroom where I could do it in stages (keeping within the 22% or 24% bracket over a number of years) but is it worth it?  My back of napkin calculation is that my ""effective tax rate"" will probably be something like 12-13% when counting the standard deduction against a ""fully taxable"" withdraw needed for cashflow reasons.

I am currently of the feeling that it would \*not\* make sense (except for perhaps estate planning) since:

1. I would pay lots in taxes up front in a tax bracket &gt;= to my anticipated bracket
2. It doesn't affect the taxability thresholds of Social Security

I got one of the cards to do a balance transfer and I have $400 left on it, and I can pay it off immediately. I use the other two cards regularly (one for cash back, one for miles) and always pay off the balance as soon as I can.

51,Balancing Student Loans against downpayment on a house + wedding,"My fiancee and I are both 25 years old, and live in Los Angeles. 

I make $80,000/yr. 
After taxes/401k/company stock purchases/insurances (mine and hers, life and medical), I take home about $4200 per month. 

My company matches me share-for-share on stock purchases (maxing out at $5000/yr), so by paying in $5,000 over the course of a year, I receive $10,000 worth of shares at FYE. My company shares have been trading sideways for a long time, so I don’t expect any significant returns here. I also receive a guaranteed year-end performance bonus of $2-8k. As such, my total compensation is more like $90,000/yr pre-tax. 

My fiancée makes $62,400/yr. After taxes/401k, she takes home about $4000 per month. 

Our total monthly take-home is thus about $8100/month (not including my stock matches or performance bonus).

Our expenses are as follows:
Rent/trash/water: 
$2025/mo 

Utilities (gas, elec.): 
$175/mo

Cell phone/internet: 
$230/mo

Food (groceries + meals out): 
$1000/mo

Household supplies: 
$150/mo

Gasoline: 
$200/mo

Entertainment/Clothing/Etc.: 
$500/mo

Car Insurance: 
$150/mo

Streaming services: 
$50/mo

Student loans (hers):
$1000/mo [74k; average APR ~7%]

Student loans (mine):
$750/mo [41k; average APR ~8%]

Total Expenses: $6200/mo
Total Income: $8200/mo
Monthly savings: $2000/mo

We have no debt aside from our student loans (115k total). We share one car since she is permanently WFH, at least until the contract she is on ends in 18 months. Im not including any irregular expenses (car repairs, medical bills, etc.) in the above calculation; I believe those are fairly well offset by my excluding my yearly bonus. While we don’t live a spartan lifestyle, I think we are living somewhat modestly. The one expense that jumps out to me is the groceries/restaurant bill. We could perhaps reduce this somewhat, say by $150/mo or so. Eating well and healthily is important to us, so I think I’d be hard pressed to get down to a $500/mo total food cost. 

Presently, we are taking the extra $2000/mo we have and throwing it at my student loans, given that I have a higher APR than does she. As such, I am paying $2750/mo against a balance of $41k; at this rate, my loans will be paid off in ~18 months. Once my loans are paid off, we would take the $2750 that is going towards my loans, and put that money towards hers. She is already paying $1000/month. $3750 going towards a balance of $66,000 (her expected SL balance in 18 months) has her loans paid off in about 20 months (38 months from now). Since we are aggressively paying down these debts, we have only a modest cash savings of $7,500 or so. 

HOWEVER: we are engaged, and planning a /reasonably/ modest wedding that we expect to cost about $15,000. We’d like to be married in late summer 2023. We would also like to put a 10% downpayment on a house/condo about 4yrs from now. The house will likely be about $450,000 when we purchase it, so we will need ~$60k for the downpayment + realtor fees. If we were to stick to the idea of throwing all of our savings at our student loans for the next 38 months, we would finish up 4 years from now debt-free, but with only $35,000 saved - much less than the $75k needed for a wedding + downpayment. 

So what is the play to make to meet the wedding/house purchase objectives? Pay off only my student loans, then begin saving for the wedding/house? Put some additional amount less than $2000 towards the student loans, and save the difference for the wedding/house? Should I be saving this $75k in cash, or should I be buying $SPY/$VTI/$QQQ shares?

52,My company is holding my last paycheck under the reason that the new accounts I signed on have not paid yet,"Hoping to get some advice from other professionals.

I work as a B2B salesperson and my salary consists of a base salary as well as variable compensation based on the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) I bring in with new customers I sign on. If it matters, it's a 50/50% split from base and variable. The company pays out a specific month's commissions in the 2nd paycheck of the following month (ex. close a deal in June, commission report and payout will happen on July 30th pay day).

I recently left that company after about 3.5 years, and at the start of my exit interview or offboarding my finance guy tells me that they're going to have to withhold my final paycheck due to some of my deals not having paid their invoice and being in delinquent status and that they'd overpaid me. Company policy is to pay out salespeople based on the net-new ARR signed, no policy on whether the invoice needs to be paid or not, may be due to payment terms being Net 30. Of course, if the new account goes dark and literally does not pay what they're legally obligated to pay (which never happened for my accounts in my 3.5 years), there's clawbacks which is valid.

So here's the deets of the final stretch: 

\- My last day was October 15.

\- I did not close a single deal in September, so there is $0 expected in variable compensation on the Oct 31 pay day.

\- The final check will only consist of my base salary for October 1-15 and any accrued PTO (if/as applicable).

\- They're withholding my final paycheck based on the justification that they haven't collected on the invoice amount of my accounts and they've overpaid me.

During the offboarding meeting, I was kinda fine with it because I'm not in a financial constraint nor did I absolutely need my check to pay the bills. But after speaking with my mentor at that previous company as well as my new mentor at my new company, they were both quite vocal about how that's flat out wrong of them and that I should be paid my base salary since I worked the time from Oct. 1-15.

I have sent a nice email requesting that we get this resolved at the next payday on the 15th, and just got a short reply saying he will get back to me.

Am I in a position to escalate this in some way and get my last paycheck or does the company have a right to withhold my last paycheck consisting of my base salary based on overpaying my commissions against pending invoices?",personalfinance,1636742600

64,RSU taxation question,"Hey everyone, have what I am hoping is a quick question here. I have received RSU awards several times over the course of the last 6-7 years and have a large batch vesting next year that I am trying to plan for. 

My company withholds shares upon vesting to cover taxes. In looking online I see that RSUs are supposed to be taxed at 22% in this scenario, but in looking at my historical records there were some batches in previous years that were taxed at 24%. Is it possible that the earlier batches of RSUs that vested last year were taxed at a different rate than more recent batches as tax rules have changed since then?

Trying to understand if I should expect to have 22%, 24% or some combination of both withheld going into next year?",personalfinance,1636740722

74,Help correcting backdoor Roth IRA mistake using Betterment," TL;DR: I am trying to do a back door Roth conversion for 2021. I contributed $6,000 to a new traditional IRA with after-tax cash savings. The $6K went up to $6,017 before I was able to convert the funds to a Roth IRA. Can I convert the full amount or can I only convert the $6,000 limit?

More detail:

I've been looking to do a back door Roth for some time now and finally got my act together. I think I may have made a mistake though and was looking for advice on how to proceed.

I use Betterment for my non-employer sponsored retirement plans. As such, I wanted to use them to do a backdoor Roth conversion out of convenience. I opened up a new traditional IRA and funded it with $6K from another cash/savings fund within Betterment. Once that cleared though and I went to go convert the funds, Betterment went and bought stocks and my funds raised to $6017. Now when I go to convert my funds, I'm not sure what to do -- can I convert the whole $6017 or can I only convert what I contributed ($6k)?

Any help would be much appreciated! I think I can ultimately convert the full $6017 amount, but will need to pay taxes on the $17. Frustrating because had I done this in another brokerage, I could've gotten those gains in the Roth IRA.

I was fearful that this would happen with Betterment given you don't have control over when they buy the underlying assets -- so for anyone using Betterment for a backdoor ROTH, be aware that you might not be quick enough to convert it before the market rises.",personalfinance,1636738795

79,Siblings and I need to get our special needs sibling out of my parents house but don’t know how to pay for it.,"TLDR; my siblings and I need to figure out a game plan financially for getting my special needs sister into a care facility/home because our special needs brother has become violent and she is the main trigger due to my parents basically non-existent parenting. They have a trust set up for them, but it will only be funded by their life insurance.

I am not even sure where to begin... my parents have two special needs children and my siblings and I have just recently found out that the younger one has become violent in the last year or so and our parents have mostly been hiding it from us. We believe that the biggest trigger for him is he's trying to control the older one because that's what my parents do (they should not have been parents) and when he can't, he becomes extremely upset and aggressive. He has hit both of my parents, kicked in a door, thrown a dumbbell weight at a door, and it's getting worse. Initially my parents didn't discipline him (they never have, my brother and I did it growing up because they wouldn't) they are very lazy parents, but now they don't because they're afraid of him. Because they very, very rarely tell him no and don't discipline him, he knows he can basically get whatever he wants and when he can't control my sister, he freaks out. The awful thing is, my parents make my sister do things or not do things just to placate him (like making her eat a second dinner if she ate early and my brother wants her to eat with them so they make her, they will make her move seats if he wants her to sit in a specific spot, etc.) and it's unbelievably unfair that my parents control her to placate him, because they're afraid of him. 

My sister would absolutely love being in a good facility/home that provided fun activities, outings, play games, make friends, etc. so we think the best solution for everyone would be to have her move into a home, and her quality of life would significantly improve while also, hopefully, our brother will not be violent anymore. 

None of my siblings and I are in a position to where we can afford to take either sibling in, and my parents have a trust set up for them, however we just found out it's only funded by their life insurance.... so no money in there until they die. We are not sure what exactly their financial situation is yet, but we'd like to get an idea of what our options may be before we approach them about it. Each sibling gets SSI each month, I can't remember how much exactly but I think it's no more than $800/month. My dad has always had quite a high income, so we're not sure if that would disqualify us for getting additional funding to help with our sister's home. My friends said we should just make our parents take a loan out to pay for it and when they die, we can pay the remainder of the loan with their life insurance money, but this could become a huge fight with them and I'm not even sure they'll comply. I could honestly see it coming to a point where we have to take them to court. 

We're very overwhelmed and would love any advice on resources, additional funding, or any other recommendations people may have.",personalfinance,1636738153

I had been employed for 2.5 years at the same company, credit was doing good, all of the things were going well.  In September 2019 I got offered an amazing job offer- the company shut down within 6 weeks of me starting there.  I ended up not getting back to work until September 2020, then stopped working that job in December due to it being a ""bad fit"" and became re-employed in March. *During this time I still had a consistent income coming in*. I have remained in the same field of employment the entire time, I don't make a lot especially since I stepped back to part-time to accommodate school/internship and my kids' therapies. My credit is decent (and still working on improving it!) and I have $5k in my personal savings and potential access to an additional $10k if absolutely necessary.

Because my income is on the lower end right now I would not get approved for enough to really buy anything with but my sister and I have discussed her cosigning with me and she said she would (she would be living on the property too so it makes sense) but she has NO credit. I have one credit card I can add her on as an AU.

From what I was reading about USDA loans it's easier to get with a 640+ score and if not you need to have at least 2 credit lines open/active and in good standing for at least 12 of the last 24 months. Not sure how we could get her past the credit part and I'm not sure if my lapse of employment would create an issue. I have no idea who to contact to find out if buying is even in the realm of possibility right now or just a crazy dream and I need to figure something else out. We DID put our numbers and info into the USDA website and qualified for quite a bit, enough to do what we need/want to do!

I’ve always struggled financially. My parents filed bankruptcy a few years into their marriage and continued to struggle until about 10 years ago, around when I moved out. I learned very bad financial habits and never really learned how to get my spending under control until recently (about 2 years ago). I set a budget and stick to it.

I have 9 cards with balances ranging from $900 to $5000. Would dent snowball be best or avalanche? Or is there some other method that is better? 

Is there a way to negotiate settlement on these debts instead? Currently I don’t need a stellar credit score. We just bought a home, I have a reliable car, I just want it paid off as fast as possible.

10,Health insurance choices when planning for pregnancy,"Hello all. My oh-so-lovable husband decided to wait until today to remind me that open enrollment through his job is ending...today. (Not entirely his fault--we have been in the process of buying a house and there's a lot on our minds). We are tentatively planning on trying for a baby in the spring, and want to choose coverage that will best mitigate some of the associated costs. Here is where I am having trouble. I have attached a link to our coverage breakdown. Currently we are on HDHP Option 2, as we are both young and healthy. The second page has the monthly premium breakdown. He falls into the category of $196/month for employee + spouse under HDHP Option 2 (his annual salary is currently around $50,000). 

The question is, should we change? If we wait to start trying until March(ish), it is likely that the baby will not be born until the following calendar year (2023). So basically, there could be the possibility of couching pre-natal care under one plan and then switching before the delivery. I understand that it is probably best to try to squeeze the whole shebang into one year, but I am not sure if we will be ready to start having a go at it this winter. Any thoughts would be so appreciated! Trying to compare so many numbers (varying HSA contributions, monthly premiums, deductibles, OOP max, coinsurance, copays...) is getting me really scrambled.

I'm 53 and this will be my first time purchasing real estate (in case 'first time home buyer' status is relevant). I am inheriting other assets that are already liquid (e.g., 50% of investment account, checking/savings account) and half of a condominium in Washington state (which my brother &amp; his wife intend to buy me out of). My total inheritance including the IRA should come to roughly US$400k. My state of residence is Oklahoma, which has no inheritance tax as I understand it.

My questions are these:

1) How to handle the IRA so I can convert it to cash while minimizing penalties &amp; potential taxes.  
2) How to best leverage my 'first time home buyer' status in my upcoming real estate purchase.  
3) Is there any other general advice that applies to my situation?

15,Reviewing Portfolio - Schwab Question,"Hey Everyone,

I was just reviewing my schwab roth IRA 2020 allocations as I continue to make 2021 contributions (I am in my early 20s). Currently, my allocations are as follows:

1. SWTSX 71.14%
2. SWISX 21.84%
3. SFENX 5.91%
4. SWAGX 1.11%

When I chose this approach, I was also considering creating a portfolio of Schwabs ETFs (SCHX, SCHA, SCHF, SCHZ). When I'm looking at YTD returns for SWTSX and SCHX (looking at these two as I view them as kind of the key players right now), it almost appears that I would have been better off going down the ETF portfolio route.

18,HSA Employer Contribution vs Voluntary Contribution,"I have have pending dental work (mostly orthodontics) that will cost me around $6,000 after insurance.  I have around $1,800 in my (new) HSA, all contributed this year.

Currently my employer has me contributing $150 a month through payroll deduction.  I've already changed it so that I'll be contributing the maximum *next* year, but I'm currently set to continue the $150 in December.

I have a few options that I can see.  All are financially viable for me, but I'm looking for the best tax / growth outcome:

A: Take nothing from the HSA, and continue to let it happily grow.  Pay for the dental out of pocket.

B: Take the $1,800 out now, then gradually withdraw money to cover the remainder as new contributions come in every month.  Obviously this will take a while, and I'm not sure how many transactions I'm allowed to make on a single bill.

C: Make a personal contribution at the end of this year to get me up to the HSA maximum, then immediately reimburse myself $3,600 for the dental, followed by monthly reimbursements.

D: Some other option that you recommend?

I think I can boil my questions down to three parts:

1. Can I reimburse myself for the dental expenses in multiple transactions?  In other words, can I pay for the dental now and then transfer money from my HSA as it becomes available?
2. Do I get the same tax advantage when I make an individual voluntary contribution to my HSA as I do when my employer deducts from my pay?  In other words, does an individual voluntary contribution reduce my taxable income when I file?  Or would I be better off waiting for my payroll deduction contributions to come through?
3. Or am I just being dumb?  If I have the funds on hand to pay for the dental work outright, am I better to just keep all the money in the HSA where it can continue to grow through investments?

In any event, starting in 2022 I'm maxing out 401k and HSA every year, so any withdrawal I make from the HSA should hopefully recover quickly.

22,How can I avoid the 10% tax penalty when withdrawing money for rent from my ABLE account?,"I receive my rent bill on the 27th/28th of every month. It's due on the 5th of the following month. My building's management requires a check to be mailed which I usually send the same day I get the bill.

An ABLE account's rules says that when used for rent, money must be withdrawn the same month it is used to avoid a 10% tax penalty. The money takes a few days to appear on my checking account once withdrawn from ABLE. If I withdraw the money the day I normally send a check, that's technically withdrawing for that same month's rent, right? Even if the money won't appear for a few days? 

The problem I'm having is how the IRS considers me to be using the money I withdrew when there was already money in the checking account I sent it too. If I were to wait until the 1st of the month to initiate a withdrawal, I would still have to send my rent check before that money hits my checking account to avoid being late. Wouldn't this then look like I withdrew money for next month's rent since I wouldn't be sending another check until the end of that month, which is for the following month's rent? Or is the date I write on the check good enough? Would I be able to initiate a withdrawal on the 1st, having my check already mailed on the 28th the prior month, but future date it to the 2nd of the month I withdrew?

Sorry if this is too confusing or if I'm overthinking all this. I don't **need** the ABLE money to pay rent, so I'm not concerned about the money being ready when I need it.",personalfinance,1636730697

I'm 32, single, unmarried, no kids. I want to start off by sending thank you to the folks in this sub-Reddit. Thanks to many Redditor's advice over the years, I was able to change my financial lifestyle and situation. At one point, I had $13,000 in credit card debt, was a college dropout and worked a minimum wage job. Now, I work in education, finished my BA, will finish a graduate certificate in eLearning Design this December, and have payed off all of my credit card debt. 

Right now, I am at a new juncture in life. 

I need to start saving. I know this much, but I am trying to figure out for what. As someone who spent their money in the now, lived through the stress of paying off debt, I am trying to develop future-oriented thinking. It's been a process. 

I'm trying to answer my why. I'm in a fortune position that I don't have to pay rent (or utilities) and I want to use it to my advantage. My expenses are low. Car is payed for. Etc. 

For me, it makes sense to break up goals into 3-month increments. Create phases. It will prevent me from overwhelming myself and chunk my goals. 

Where do I begin? Emergency fund? Save up cash like a rapper preparing for the economic apocalypse? I have read stories about people who pay off their student loans in two years. I currently have $43,000 in student loans. I make $42,000 a year. Pay off student loans and become another success story? Would it be wise to just throw money at my student loan debt? What about interest rates? Get a higher paying job? Saving up for a house? All of it at the same time? If so, how do I manage all the spinning plates. I just need some direction, and help with a plan that leads to **sustainable financial habits that will enrich my quality of life and my future family's**

37,Major life change. How to adjust retirement savings?,"Hi,

Need help adjusting my retirement savings now that my household is two people.

29F, single, no kids. Just purchased my first home last month in HCOL ($1,300) Salary 100K, stable gig. 

My single parent is very ill w/ cancer, and lives in the boonies. I live in a place with great access to healthcare. Parent moved in this week. It was a no brainer for the family. Siblings back home will take over the house while we begin treatment where I am.

I currently contribute 13% gross salary to deferred comp, 6% to pension, and max out my Roth IRA. 

Now that my household is two, how should I adjust? My parent obviously won’t be able to work, which is fine. I still want to be able to take care of my leisure activities during this difficult time.

38,Requesting advice on whether to take high-paying job with lower pension,"Should I take a new job which will have higher salary, but a lower pension?

I’m a 40-year old married California government employee. I currently have nothing saved up for retirement, but I would retire at age 67 with a pension under California’s 2.5@67 formula, that would pay $90k annual. Under Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision, I would receive no Social Security. 

I may have an opportunity for a new job, where I would be making $25k more per year, but my pension would only be $50k annual under the 1.62@65 formula. From age 40 to age 67, I would probably save enough in a 457 to have $800k upwards. 

So is making $25k more per year for the next quarter-century worth it if my income during retirement is going to be substantially less?",personalfinance,1636727925

42,Thinking about swapping my car for something older but more reliable. Good idea?,"Hi r/PF,

I currently drive a 2014 Nissan Versa Note. I bought it new 7 years ago and it currently has ~60,000 miles on it. I only drove it daily for about a year until I changed jobs and no longer needed it to commute. It is fully paid off. So far, its been a great little car. Have not needed to put any money into it besides brakes/other routine maintenance. However, everything I read online tells me how horrible the transmissions on these cars are and how they're essentially ticking time bombs.  

Recently, my fiancée started a new job that she needs a car to get to so she started driving it every day. I'm worried now that as the miles start to rack up that the problems will start rolling in. I put the car's info into Carvana and was offered $8,0000 for it. Seems like a pretty good deal to take the money and put it towards a used model of something more reliable. Looking online it seems I'd need to get something a few years older/with more miles on it to stay in my price range. Does it make sense to sell a newer, lower mileage car for an older, higher mileage car that should be more reliable?

TLDR: Should I sell my current car with spotty reliability records for an older, higher mileage but more reliable model?",personalfinance,1636727556

My husband (non-US resident, non-citizen) is sending me (US citizen) a 4 digit figure to pay off my remaining credit card balance. Initially, we tried to use Transferwise to send it directly to the card issuer’s account, however, the note section doesn’t have enough characters for me to enter my card number. My credit card’s customer service recommended that I just transfer from his bank account to mine, and then pay my card as usual. 

However, with the amount being transferred, I’m wondering if it will now count as some sort of “gift” and that it will end up affecting my tax situation.

Preferably sometime next year,  but that might not be financially possible depending on what the market/my life looks like,  but definitely within the next 5 years. I have an emergency fund in a high (lol) interest online savings account, a brokerage loaded with index ETFs and a Roth IRA which I understand has some benefits for first time home buyers. 

Here's the thing - I know I shouldn't be putting anymore of my down payment money into the stock market, and I should at least be putting all new funds into an FDIC insured bank account. In like 2018, when the APY on the savings account was higher than inflation, it would've been an easy pill to swallow. Now, however, in 2021, my inflation is high and rates are abysmal. I really really don't want to put any more money into high interest savings because it's losing value, especially considering how well it could  be doing if it put it in the market instead.

So my question is if there is any middle ground? I know I bonds are popular right now, but I might not be holding onto the cash for a full year and would get penalized. I suppose I could buy more bond ETFs to make my portfolio more conservative.",personalfinance,1636726025

32, no considerable savings (long time student followed by zero-income years and got my first full time job recently). I've got maybe a few thousand total saved and ""saved"" (some play money on the stock market).

I'm terrible with money but I've started making up a plan on how to stop living paycheck to paycheck and actually start putting money into savings (potentially up to 1200/month from the start of next year). Basically, I think I've finally started getting the manchild under control after ten months of flipping the fuck out with some major lifestyle creep and a ""treat yoself!"" Attitude.

I am currently making 2500/month after tax, job pays for pension, no car, no true medical fees in Sweden and no real big loans other than a 110dollar/month student loan with no real interest.

I've also just been offerered an apartment for rent, and getting those in my area is rough in general.

I'm currently living with my parents (due to the three years of just falling in between the cracks of societal support, largely brought on by me not being able to ask for help when deep, deep in depression and burnout). My rent and food costs are ridiculously low (basically just self-costs; some $500/month with food, rent and bills).

The new apartment would cost me about $1000/month for rent and bills, food not included.

I would be closer to work, have my own place for my own peace of mind (and also the ability to have some free psych-support come visit each week to help me get off my ass and keep things in order). I would live closer to friends, be able to have people over and have a much easier time going to events, staying out past 8pm for gym or events (last bus home from town leaves at 8).

But overall, if we're being realistic, I'd be going from 2000 ""leftover cash"" each month down to something like 900. At least until I get back my old, student-days routine of food budgeting properly etc, which might eek out an extra 100.

And here comes the crux of it all.

My parents have always, always been people of ""buy, don't rent"" and ""owning real estate is the best thing you can invest in"". And now, I've got one parent going ""yeah. I understand why you'd want to move out, you can't live in a single room until you're thirty five. You'd have less to save, but if you're not really saving now, then getting your own place might help you budget better and start  saving.""

And the other parent going ""yeah. But all of that money is money you could save to get a starter apartment.""

I've got until Monday to decide if I should say yes to the flat or not.

And I'm just not sure...

As said, I'm starting to get my shit together, and if I end up saving something like 1500/month, I'd need two years to save up for a starter, 2-room apartment in town. (15-20% down-payment and 300-350.000 dollars for such a flat).

long time lurker, first time poster. I will try to be very brief with you guys and hoping you can steer me to the right direction. Apologies to the honourable mods if this goes against sub rules.


I work in an oil refinery in the middle east. There's not much to do so I am able to save a big chunk of my earnings. I'd say I can comfortably save $70k a year. I have saved $200k thus far.

Work is very demanding, sometimes 12-15 hours a day so I don't really have a great deal of free time to monitor the market and keep up with an investment.

What are my options? and most importantly, what kind of service provider shall I be seeking? ie. wealth managers? financial planners? banks?


Some facts:

- I don't want to invest in the middle East, things are too volatile here

Total price was $40,000, a little higher because I was getting out of a lease early but they actually gave me more then my lease was worth so I ended up rolling like $3,000 into this loan.

The thing is every time I get a refinance quote, its for a longer term AND my monthly payments end up being in the $700s What's going on? Is there a specific time I'm supposed to wait to refinance as in over a year or so?

84,What is the best way to limit tax obligation when inheriting money from parents? More detail in post.,"The specific scenario details:

My parents will have anywhere between $750,000-$1.5mm when they pass and they were trying to figure out what would be the best way to limit the tax obligation for myself and my siblings when we eventually inherit the funds. 

I do plan on asking an estate attorney but I was hoping those in the community who have been in similar situations or those who have experience in an industry that deals with this could offer some of their real world advice. 

Thank you for the help!

Some ideas we had first:

1.	Add the siblings as joint or co-signers on existing accounts and when they eventually pass the siblings and I would have access to funds. We’re not sure how this would affect the siblings though. Would the funds in the account be considered income at this point?
2.	Add the siblings and myself as beneficiaries on existing accounts. When they eventually pass any remaining funds would be distributed equally to the beneficiaries. 
3.	Placing the accounts in a Trust and add myself and my siblings as trustees or secondary trustees. 
4.	We know there is an option for gifting some funds every year but the siblings and I want our parents to keep the funds and use them in their retirement as much as possible. So we didn’t think this would be a viable route. 

Any and all advice is appreciated! Thank you!",personalfinance,1636719360

He kept texting me about sending him the money since he “already bought the tickets” and he’s really excited to go and called multiple times to ensure. So I just sent the money on the 19th via Zelle on good faith since I’d known him since 7th grade back in 07’. We aren’t super close or anything.

31st rolls around and I don’t hear shit from him all morning, all the while the past two days he was texting me how excited he is to catch up and stuff, so looking good so far!

I also wanted to add a third friend to bring and he said he can’t do it since he already bought the tickets and the refund would be 3-5 days so I know damn well it’s not taking near two weeks.

Anyway, we never fucking went and he has my $172. We called that Sunday on the 31st and he said he’ll ask for a refund since we didn’t go since he got caught up doing some firefighter stuff and a homeless person died.

I wasn’t pestering him or anything everyday asking for it, we talked 3 times. The 31st a phone call, 4th and 11th of November. 

His text responses are weird, why the fuck am I being made out to be in the wrong for asking for MY money back? Ya bro, $172 isn’t going to kill me either but it’s my damn money, if it’s not so much send me double my $172 originally and then your - let’s hear the tune then.

98,Need help with preventing potential Chase account closure,"Hello I received an email from Chase stating that they are going to close my checking and savings account. This has me extremely worried and stressed out because a majority of my credit cards are on chase and I have no idea what to do. I did some research and assume it is the checks I recently deposited. I deposited a few checks to help pay for my parents bills that I put on my credit cards. These checks were deposited into my checking account and there were 5 of them. $2220+$760+$245+$130. The final one was a check of $2230 that got rejected at first because I scratched the name the check was addressed to so I could cash it in but it got rejected so my family wrote me a separate check to deposit instead which seems to had been accepted. I have all the checks and can bring it into Chase to explain but I feel like it probably won’t work and if Chase determined that they want to cut me off I am screwed. 

Really don’t know where to go from here but I made a meeting for later today to speak with someone at a local branch where I plan to bring those checks and try to explain the situation to them but I can’t shake the feeling that I am screwed. I am worried because I have read that people have had their entire CHASE credit cards closed in association to their checking and savings accounts being closed. Furthermore I’m worried about my credit score and potential future banking options assuming this could possibly mark me as a red flag to other banks. 

The only thing that I am clinging to is that in the letter provided it says that “we may be able to keep your account open if you provide the information we ask for.” Seems very slim because they never asked for anything except in the notice during the initial check rejection to bring the declined check to a local chase branch but I thought that bringing it in would do nothing as it got rejected so I could test it as being VOID.

Checkings, Savings, Freedom, Freedom Unlimited, Amazon Prime, Sapphire Preferred, and the Ink Cash (newly opened and still working on the sign up bonus)

Looking to buy ideally in London - I have a large deposit of approx £130k (even I know this may not be enough!). My question is : would it be better to buy e.g. a (very small probably) 1 bed flat within zone 4 London to live in , or continue renting in London and purchase somewhere just outside London or further afield as a doer upper and look to sell that in eg 3 years, or even buy abroad as an investment? 

Anyone had experience of either?

44,I got charged $48 at a gas station when I only took $15 of gas.,"So T-Mobile gives a 10¢ off a gallon on top of the base 5¢ a gallon every week at Shell stations through Fuel Rewards. 

I went to a Shell station yesterday with the 15¢ fuel rewards code I got this week. I put in my phone number and the screen said I had ""15¢ off per gallon"". I swiped my credit card and it said ""Approved"" I then expected it to tell me to release the nozzle and select the grade but it didn't. It automatically went from the ""approved"" screen to the ""thank you for shopping"" screen which always comes up after I take gas.

I waited about a minute or two and thought that that pump had a glitch so I went to another pump. This time the screen told to go inside. I went inside, put my fuel rewards number in, and prepaid $60 with my credit card. 

When I came to the pump I saw the price only took off the base 5¢ off, not the additional 10¢ which I am supposed to get. I cancelled went inside and told the attendant. He was super understanding but couldn't help. So I prepaid $15 took the gas and left thinking ""this isn't a big deal, I'll come back next week"".

So today I checked my credit card transactions. I see the $60 transaction refunded and the $15 transaction went through as expected. But what I also see is an additional $48 transaction at the same gas station. At first I though it was a pre-authorization and that I would get it back. But then I checked my email and got an email receipt from Shell/Fuel Rewards showing that I took 14.5 gallons for $48. 

I only took 4 gallons yesterday so that $48 transaction is definitely not mine. The only thing I can think of is that the first pump allowed someone else to pump gas with my authorization after I left.

So what can I do here? Should I report this as fraudulent? Is this my fault in anyway? If so what should I have done differently?

I am in NY if that makes any difference.

TLDR: Went to the gas station. Pump gave me an error so I cancelled and left. I now see a $48 transaction on my credit card and an e-receipt in my email.",personalfinance,1636694222

1. Should I do the HSA option or just the regular option? Again I'm a healthy 26 year old with no anticipated major medical expenses.

2. If I do the HSA, how much should I contribute? Is it a bad idea to contribute nothing and just take the $500 from my employer?

54,Non disclosed fire damage for pending house? Fraud?,"So as the title suggests, I just found out there was a house fire at a house for which I am currently in the buying process. 

Long story short, I am in the later stages of closing on a home. Today, I contacted a home insurance agent, who relayed to me hours later if I had known about a fire just over 2 years ago at this home. The house then, was roughly a value of $135k and had a insurance payout of $117k from what she can see in 2019. 

Forward to today, it has passed through 2 different new hands. The person who originally bought it was a cash flipper who sold the same house a week later with nothing into from 135k to 150k. 

The second person was the flipper, who apparently put 40-50k+ in, after 3 months and is now selling to me at 230k. 

After going through the house 3x, there is no evidence at all. The home inspector suspected nothing of the sort either. It has noticeably used original hardwood, no new looking walls in main floor or basement, and a 10 year old furnace/AC unit. The only thing that looks very new is the kitchen after being “flipped” but is very small with no damage outside either, so no way that was $117k. 

After finding this out, I immediately contacted the sellers realtor who claims “this is news to him” and apparently they have absolutely no idea about the fire only 2 years ago for an immense amount of damage. Although they paid cash and apparently have no home insurance agent to check that, I find it hard to believe. I still need to get the story straight and figure out what was damaged, if they are lying to me, or who can get me the full story. 

My question is, do I get out of the contract, do I take legal action in some fashion, or (besides trying to find out the extent of the fire and what happened) what should be my next steps? It is Cincinnati, OH and I am 26 if that matters. 

P.S. there was nothing disclosed, it said no to fire damage; and there is no barn or external part of the residence in any fashion that could have been part of a fire.",personalfinance,1636692176

My MIL(46) is just now beginning to look into retirement planning. She makes a little over 200k/year. Right now she has 2 401(k)s, one has $12,200 and the other $53,000. This evening I went through the fund options in both these accounts, and together we picked funds since they were in bonds 100% before. 


She is hoping to retire in 10 years, or less, and told me she has the ability to put $5,000/month back towards retirement. Since the max contribution for the 401(k) will be $20,500 in 2022, I’m wondering what other accounts or options she has. I’m no experienced financial planner, and so I advised her to find a true professional to navigate some of those waters for her. 

I guess I’m asking what other advice anyone has for myself, and for her in this situation. I’d love to see her happy and financially healthy in retirement, and would like to be a good resource for her, as she doesn’t have any financial experience whatsoever. 

Thanks!",personalfinance,1636689594
76,I just found out that I owe $500+ to PG&amp;E and I don't know what to do,"PG&amp;E called me a few days ago to inform me that I've been getting billed for an address for almost 15 months, for a total of more than $500. I have never lived at, nor seen a bill, for this address. I vaguely recall signing a lease for this place in 2020, but the property manager backed out of the contract so I never moved in. When signing the lease, I opened an account with PG&amp;E because according to the contract, tenants were responsible gas and electricity, so I must have forgotten to close the account when the lease fell through.

This sum is now in collections at PG&amp;E and they have told me they can do nothing to help me out. Apparently this type of situation is usually caught earlier because PG&amp;E would stop service when the customer misses a payment, but PG&amp;E never stopped service due to the pandemic. So I asked them for the statements, and called the property management company to explain the situation. They were not able to disclose their tenants' information (understandably), but they were willing to forward an email that I would draft to the resident. I have not heard back from the resident, and honestly unless this individual is hugely benevolent, I don't see them getting back to me or covering these bills. 

According to the representative at PG&amp;E, my only other choice is to seek settlement at a small claims court. I have never been to court. Please teach me how to adult this.",personalfinance,1636689336
77,"Just got my credit card, can you double check my strat?","Hey guys I just got my first credit card, the purpose of this card is to maximize my credit as fast as possible. I never had credit before.

\- Utilize up to 10% of my credit ($5k -&gt; 500)  
\- Always pay on time &amp; full.  
\- Keep it as long as possible.  
\- Ask for increase every 6 months until it reaches over 10 x my average monthly expenses to maintain a 10% utilization.

81,"I can't afford the life I want in Los Angeles, but don't know where else to go?","I've lived in LA for 8 years, and I truly love living here. I have great friends, the weather is perfect, and I work in the film industry which is based here. However, at 30, I'm only making about $55k a year. I should be much higher up in my industry, but I got fucked over with promotions and growth partly due to the pandemic, and haven't been able to take the next step in my career after aggressively job hunting for the past 8 months, and its taken a huge beating on my self esteem and mental health. Especially since the people I started out with have almost all gone on to promotions, while I'm stuck at the bottom.

I'm tired of living with roommates and budgeting aggressively just to afford groceries every month. I'm stressed about money all the time. I don't know how I'll ever afford a house here. Especially since I'm still single, and only have my small income. Honestly half of why I want a partner at this point in my life is for combined finances. So, I think I'm ready to bite the bullet and give up LA and working in television to have more income, and hope to transition into tech marketing. Or something a little more profitable. Whatever will hire me, if anywhere will hire me since I've spent the last decade in an industry that might not translate to other roles.

Problem is, I don't know where else in the country to go. All the people I know are either in LA, or the Bay Area where I'm from, which is even more unaffordable. There's no where else I'm particularly interested or excited to move to, but this life in LA just doesn't seem sustainable. I'm so anxious and depressed thinking how I'll be renting and living with roommates, barely making ends meet until I die, if I stay in LA. Any tips on where else to go? I'd like to live somewhere with nice weather, liberal educated nice people, ideally cultural happenings, and some singles on the off chance I can actually find a partner. Everything just totally sucks.

tldr: Couldn't hack it in LA, not sure where else to go or what to do.",personalfinance,1636688337

89,Holding off on buying a house for another few years. Should I use the house savings to pay off student loans?,"My partner and I (33) started aggressively saving for a house a few years ago. We reached our savings goal last year, and now the money sits in a HYSA. 

Life took a turn, and my partner is now returning to school, so we put our house search on pause. We don’t plan to buy a home (or touch the money) for another three years (or at least until they’re established career-wise).

I’m trying to figure out what to do (if anything) with the money I saved for a home. During the pandemic, once I reached my savings goal for the house, I started working on tackling my student loans. Right now, that money is also parked in a HYSA until it’s time to start re-paying in Jan. Once payments resume, I’ll still have about 37k remaining (three student loans in total, ranging from 5.4-6.8% interest). 

I’m trying to figure out if it makes financial sense to put the ‘house’ money ($40k) towards eliminating my student loans. I only recently (as in early this year) began contributing to my retirement accounts, so I know I may have some ‘catching-up’ to do here as well. 

Some additional info: 
- No other debt (including CC). 
- Maxing out my Roth &amp; SEP-IRA this year and plan to continue doing so in the years to come. 
- No access to 401K, as I’m self-employed. 
- Have my six month emergency fund. 

My inclination is to pay off SL with the house savings &amp; then rebuild the house savings over the next 2-3 years. (This is doable.) But I’m trying to think through what the “best”financial option would be (based on numbers/math). I feel like I’ve been staring at these numbers for too long that I’m also wondering if I’m missing something so any food for thought/other options to consider are also welcome!

91,"Balancing student loans, retirement, and saving for my first home.","Hello all, 

I'm looking for some guidance here. Maybe reassurance that my plan makes sense going forward. 

Here's a quick screenshot of my budget - [https://imgur.com/a/QJEIRLO](https://imgur.com/a/QJEIRLO)

Currently, after all my bills are paid and I've funded my lifestyle, I have roughly $2000/mo leftover that I am trying to decide what to do with. 

I am putting that away into savings currently to rebuild my emergency fund after an impromptu job change and relocation, which should be neatly wrapped up by end-of-year. I am shooting for 3 months of expenses saved. 

Once I hit that goal, this is where I have options that I'd like help deciding. Ideally, I would like 6 months to a year of emergency funds saved, but 3 months is a good cushion for now. 

I currently have \~$37k in Federal student loans, half are subsidized (interest-free) and half are unsubsidized (carry an interest rate). 

I have \~$4000 split between credit card debt and the remainder of a motorcycle note. 

I am **not** currently contributing to an IRA, though I have roughly $2000 I would like to rollover to Schwab or another firm (currently with Northwestern Mutual, trying to get out of there fast). However, I am a government employee with a nice pension system setup. I am not vested yet, and am only 24 years old. 

I would also like to begin saving for a home. I'm sick of dealing with landlords and crappy neighbors. My girlfriend and I have been talking it over and are willing to commit - we are also aware of the marriage advice, no need to dive into that for home ownership on this post. :)

All that being said, I would like to outline my plan for your consideration - please tell me what you think should be changed, or if you agree with the idea. Like I said, looking for either guidance or reassurance here. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Once my 3-month savings goal is hit, I would like to aggressively pay down my credit-card and motorcycle debt. This would free up another \~$250/mo to use elsewhere. With student loan payments coming due at the end of January 2022, I would be making just the minimum payments during this time. This would likely only take about 2 months to complete. 
2. Once my CC and motorcycle loan are paid off, I would have roughly $2250/mo to allocate. I would put the large majority of this into my student loans - make the minimum on my subsidized loans, and as much as possible on the unsubsidized loans to pay them off as quickly as possible. No IRA investing at this point. 
3. Once subsidized loans are wiped out (roughly $16k, so by the end of next year if putting $2k/mo into it) I would then divide my available funds between paying down my subsidized (interest-free) loans, maxing out an IRA, and saving for a home. 

Some other considerations like continuing to add a small amount into savings to slowly build it up to a 6-month cushion, potentially bumping up my ""lifestyle"" funding, are here too, but this would be roughly $300-400/mo. 

Thank you for your time and consideration - I hope my rambling here has made sense and would love to hear anyone's feedback on this plan going forward.",personalfinance,1636686385

10,401k Maxing Question,"I've been dropping my contribution percentage throughout the year trying to delay hitting $19.5k until as closest to the end of 2021 as possible. I'm currently only a few hundred dollars away. I was under the impression this would be my best option to ensure I'd continue to receive matching contributions from my employer. 

Today I discovered that a coworker maxed a few months ago and has continued to contribute and receive matching. Apparently, my colleague selected a spillover option which allowed after-tax contributions after hitting $19.5k which led to continued employer matching.

My contribution has been as high as 20% but was most recently around 6% which provided me with a decent amount of excess funds which I've been putting into a taxable brokerage account.

Would it have made more sense to have maxed earlier and continued contributing after-tax money like my coworker has been doing or is what I've been doing a better option?

SoFi does not offer Inherited IRAs as an account option.

TD Ameritrade *might* be a solution as I was chatting with an agent that said they do offer Inherited IRAs and they also can enable Limited Margin for those accounts. But I'm a little nervous that since they got bought by Schwab, this feature might go away in the future.

I wasn’t paid for my hours worked and after contacting the agent that was servicing me I was told the first week that I took too long to report the hours and because the employer had to confirm it would be pushed back. Ok fine. The following week I was told that the employer has not verified the hours and that payroll is trying to contact them and it was suggested that I go out my way to visit the employer to have them verify the hours.

My LOC limit is 15k.  Would it be wise to use my savings to pay of the LOC and transfer the CC debt to it and start wittling that down or should I wait till I have more of a buffer in my savings and those numbers go down a bit?

I'm wondering what would be the best course of action currently?

35,Tax Implications from Buying a Condo?,"Hello Redditors. I have a question for the community regarding the purchase of a condo.

This year, my mother retired and sold her house. She set aside a portion of her money with plans to purchase a condo in Florida. She found a condo she likes, but her credit score was too low for her to be able to buy a condo herself in that community. Since I have a decent credit score, I agreed to purchase the condo, with the understanding that it's ""her"" condo, even though it's legally only in my name. She gifted(?) me the money for the cost of the condo, about $70,000. Other than paying for everything out of my bank account, the only thing I actually contributed financially is establishing that I have the income to pay ongoing HOA fees and property taxes. Are there any other tax implications for me related to this situation? Do I have to establish to the IRS where I suddenly got $70,000 from to buy a condo? Is that something I need to report on my tax return for 2021? Would any government body even care? / Would they tax me to kingdom come?

As an aside, the condo complex didn't consider it strange for a family member to be purchasing a condo for their retired parent. I guess that's not an unusual circumstance.",personalfinance,1636677531

Called Affirm the next morning as soon as they opened and let them know it was fraud. They did a quick 2 day “investigation” where I spoke to absolutely NOBODY in the fraud department and they emailed me today stating it appears to be mine. (It’s not, AT ALL)

Where do I go from here? I contacted all 3 credit bureau‘s the day all of this happened but was only able to get ahold of a person through Equifax. The agent tried to put a fraud alert on my credit but since I already have one on there, he told me he couldn’t. Last December my Social Security card was stolen, and I put a fraud alert on it at that time so that is still active right now. I called Affirm back today and spoke with a supervisor that took a very thorough statement from me regarding my SSN being stolen, etc, and he explained they’d look into it again, but it  didn’t sound promising. The amount is only $130 but it’s how it’s going to affect my credit that pisses me off.

40,In need of career/financial advice!!!,"So I have a bit of a dilemma and am searching for advice:

I am about to turn 26 years old, I have no education other than a couple of random community college courses, and currently no savings.  I've recently gotten a small pay raise that will allow me to change that last one, although the max I can save will be about $700 per month. My parents' financial situation growing up was such that they couldn't contribute anything towards college, and due to one parent being manipulative and abusive (some kind of narcissistic personality disorder as near as we can tell) living at home while going to school wasn't an option. So, I moved out as soon as I could and went to work full time.  I'm now in a slightly better spot due to getting a promotion/raise and I want to work towards getting my degree. At the number of hours I need to work, I could take at the absolute max 2 classes per quarter, so it would take me a very long time to finish my degree.  This wouldn't bother me, except for this next part.

My mom, who is approaching her sixties, has no savings or assets of any kind (she rents), no degree, makes minimum wage, her health isn't amazing, and she lives paycheck to paycheck.  She is still raising my youngest sibling, and to compound things, is about to get married to someone who is older than she is, who also has very limited earning potential and minimal savings. 

So my dilemma is this:

I really want to go to school, study something that interests me, and try to make a career out of it. But, I know that my siblings and I are my mom's only retirement plan and I feel I should just keep working and save as much as I can. Getting an education that will increase my earning potential is a better long term plan, but considering how long it will be until I am actually able to benefit from it has me worrying that something like a major health issue is going to come up sooner than later and I won't be able to help.  So what does everyone think? Should I just go for it and hope for the best? Or should I get some sort of short-term certification I'm really not interested in just to increase my income? Or should I just keep working full time and saving as much as I can and hope I get the opportunity to go to college sometime in the future?  Have any of you been in the same position? If so, what did you do and how did it turn out? What do you think would be the smartest decision I could make?  Thanks in advance:)",personalfinance,1636676349

My husband has not made progress to pursue cleaning up the taxes and I’m interested in any resources some may be able to suggest as well as any advice for me moving forward.

So i live in a Right to Work state so her employer can fire her whenever but by not saying she is fired they are putting her in jeopardy of possibly not being able to get unemployment to make up for a months of wages lost due to her ""quit date being moved up"".

44,How do I start investing?,"Hey everyone. I'm looking to get some opinions on how I should start investing. A little about my situation: I'm 32, single, $220K in my 401K (I contribute 15%), $15K in savings, and will be paying my mortgage off in January. My condo is worth about $350K and I make about $150K. I did the Dave Ramsey baby steps.   


Once the condo is paid off, I'd like to start investing the extra money I'm currently putting toward the mortgage every month. It will be monthly investments, totaling around $40-50K/ year. I'm not entirely sure what my investment goal is. Maybe early retirement, or maybe I'll use some of it to buy a better house at some point. Either way, it seems like growth is what I should be looking for. Thoughts?  


My first question is should I use active mutual funds, index funds, or ETFs? Would you recommend a single fund to start or multiple? Is it normal to invest monthly, or is that strange? I keep seeing references to huge, one-time investments of like $50- $100K in my research, which seems like it loses the cost averaging aspect.  


I was looking into advisors, but they seem kind of scammy, especially the Dave Ramsey Smart-Vestors or whatever they're called. Would you guys recommend an advisor? I think I'm a pretty intelligent person, and I'm comfortable doing this myself, unless that's a huge no-no.  


I have an account at Fidelity. Will that work, or do you think I should open a Vanguard account or something? Also, should I do their Admiral shares to reduce cost?

45,Buying a house while living with serious girlfriend,"I’ve been planning to buy a house for a while. And now it’s about to be real. I’ve been with my girlfriend almost a year and I know that’s not really that long but we are both serious and also very conscious about the fact that we may not be together forever. You never know when your feelings/life direction/or outside factors can change.

She’s living with me now in the apartment I already had and I make 90-100k (commission) and she makes a part time hostess wage since she’s still in school. It has been great living together for the last 6 months (yes, we moved in together pretty quick) and haven’t had any issues. Right now I cover rent, about $1000 after utilities. But we’ve been talking about how a house would work and we came up with a plan that we think is smart, equitable, and realistic. We could be totally wrong and looking for a potential reality check if one of you can see a scenario in which this doesn’t work.

So our idea is; I’m covering all costs associated with buying the house since it’s *my* house. And while we’re dating, we basically treat it like she’s paying rent, obviously lower than true market value, and the house and mortgage stay all in my name so we don’t get entangled, complicated, and risky. Again, we’re trying to be realistic. Then we’re thinking that if and when we get married, we put the mortgage/house into both of our names and we split the payment so that we’re both paying an equal portion of our incomes. Not an equal dollar amount but maybe yearly we can assess how much we’re each making and adjust, if necessary, what portion of the mortgage we’re each paying.

Is this adequate/necessary? Neither one of us likes the idea of joint accounts so even after marriage we’d each have our own incomes going into our own accounts. Is it necessary to add her to the mortgage once we’re already married? Even if her and I don’t work longer term, this will be good info.

46,My Parents Lost Money Investing in My Uncle's Startup,"My first introduction to personal finance was when I started college and my family's finances started falling apart.

My father worked at Goldman Sachs for a long time and made pretty good money, so I fortunately lived very comfortably growing up. Unfortunately, he lost his job during the 2008 financial crisis and had a hard time finding work again. He eventually did, but he never quite made it back to that same income level, whereas my family's expenses grew tremendously and I was close to starting college. To top it off, my parents birthed me later in life (they were both 42), so they were older when the financial crisis happened. The majority of their 401k was in stocks because they started investing later in life (they are immigrants and came to the US in 1989), so they lost a good chunk of their retirement funds during the crisis. My father became more aggressive with investing at that time in order to make the money back, including investing in my uncle's alternative fuel company.

My uncle started working with a Canadian-Russian scientist on an alternative fuel cell based on aluminum, which he claimed would revolutionize the energy industry. However, he was a terrible salesman and pitch-man, and so every investor he spoke to he rubbed the wrong way. People would ask to see a prototype or would ask technical questions, and my uncle would tell them that they are not technical enough to understand the product. With few funding options, he asked my father, who would always stick out his neck to help his brothers (despite my mother's reluctance).

My uncle had received several offers to purchase the patents for anywhere from $1m-$10m over the course of the company, and never took those offers because he believed in the long term vision of the company. Unfortunately, he was not the person to execute that vision - this was something my father did not understand. He was blinded by the innovation of the product that he missed the fact that the CEO was unable to sell the product to real customers.

As a result, my parents took out loans against their 401k as well as their home in order to put me through college - something I feel guilty about to this day. I would run to the scholarship office every semester, asking for more money to help pay for school. It felt pathetic.

This exposure definitely taught me how to: 1. manage my own money, 2. how not to invest/things to look out for, 3. how NOT to speak to investors and build a company. I went on to have a career in finance after college and started building a company myself - this experience has been a huge driver for me.",personalfinance,1636675546

Newer Roth IRA holder in my late 20s and had a question regarding when people talk about contributing, in this instance $500, to their Roth IRA. Currently I have VFFVX and contribute $250 into it twice a month which in turn increases the quantity automatically. No issues here, pretty straightforward. But I also have an ETF - VTI which I can't seem to automatically transfer money into the same way I would VFFVX, I am assuming because this is an ETF whereas VFFVX is a mutual fund?? So in the case of ETF's am I to simply have $250 auto deposited into my settlement fund and then from there buy more of VTI? Is that what you are supposed to do with ETFs?

54,Discrepancy between Fidelity 401(k) account contributions and actual contributions deducted,"Background info: $405.18 deduction on paycheck for 401(k) contribution back in September, Traditional 401(k) account through fidelity does not show that contribution. Payroll was contacted but referred me to Fidelity stating that “this an automatic file sent to them” regarding the deduction. I contacted Fidelity who stated that a contribution with that amount cannot be found. Official payroll YTD amount for 401(k) contributions shows $6,514.67 and Fidelity YTD contributions shows $6,109.49, the difference between the two being the exact amount deduction from my September paycheck.

55,"My job overpaid me since Sept. 1, and is now - after I put in my 2 weeks - requesting that I pay them back. What can I do to make sure things go correctly?","Work says they overpaid me because when I went part-time, they never adjusted my salary to reflect that, so I was still getting paid a full-time salary. The financial office had HR call me over the phone and tell me all of this. She said I owed them a sum of $1000 something from bi-weekly pay periods since September 1st. They arrived at this figure this by getting the difference between my now correct gross sum from my incorrect gross sum (which, when I did it on my own, I got $914). I got no written notice of this - this is all via phone. 

My question is: is this correct that they can ask me to pay back a total that includes gross pay when I only received net pay after deductions? How can they ask me to pay back money that I never actually got? I asked this question to HR, and I also asked for written notice with deductions calculated, and they will be “getting back to me”.

57,How are my grandparents really this well off even in this day and age of inflation?,"I found out just a little bit ago that my Grandfather (89) is bragging about how he has now been retired, longer than he had worked. Myself and my cousins have always heard and sort of known that he retired early and was a fortunate man. I'm still not exactly sure what he did for a living but was involved in Aerospace. 

Anyway, he retired 34 years ago at age 55. Meaning he likely only worked for 34 years since age 21 since he's bragging about all of this. My questions lie in the fact that, my Grandmother never worked. They raised six kids within a span of 11 years from the oldest to the youngest one. Our family has always been in Missouri, so I'm assuming a low cost area. He must've worked through the late 50's, 60's, 70's and early 80's.

I guess I just don't understand how he and my Grandmother are doing so well now given that he just moved into a new house 7 or 8 years ago. Which is massive. (4,400 sqft) and he drives the same nice style of truck that I own that sometimes I think was even too pricey for me and I'm still working.

Does the insane cost of everything in today's world not apply to him? How did he know back in 1987 that he had enough to retire early at 55 and be just fine in 2021 with energy costs, housing, and everything? How do I mirror that same level of comfortability? Is it just as easy as saving really well? I'm 37 years old and am looking to retire in 2049 (age 65).

At the moment I don’t think she has any idea into my salary, savings, etc.  She stays over 3-4 nights a week as is so if all goes well for 6 months I’ll be proposing. 

My situation:

- I make about about $105k all in ($95.5k salary + 10% bonus). 

- My only debt is $4k of student loans. I plan to pay this off by June. After it’s paid off I’m going to finance a $15k - $20k car to get out of a 10 year old Kia with 225k miles.  Hopefully the car market is normalized by then. 

- I have $55k liquid assets. I dont know the exact split at the moment but it’s &gt;50% cash. Probably closer to 75% cash.  I assume at least 50% of this will disappear for a ring, wedding, honeymoon. I’m going to contribute to this up to and after then. 

- $100k +/- $2k-$3k in retirement accounts. 

Other than that I don’t have anything to my name. No inheritance, no real estate.  Just that amount of cash/investments and a 10 year old Kia. A cat too.

* Increased my 401K contribution to 6% to get the full 7% company match.
* Opened a Roth IRA and set up $500 monthly deposits.

6,Buying a second house steps,"Hello, new to Reddit but thought it’d be a good place to gather info. I bought my current house as real fixer upper 6 years ago for 95k when I was making $12.50 an hour. Fast forward to today and I’ve changed careers and now making approx 65k a year and now have fixed up home quite a bit. Homes in area are going for about 300k give or take 20k and I owe 78k on it still so I think I’ve got at least 200k in equity. Well now I’ve fallen in love with a house that is 450k but also have a 14k truck payment and 15k van payment and 20k in student debt. I wasn’t planning to even start looking at another house until cars were paid off cause right now my debt to income ratio can’t be good. Could I use equity to pay off cars and student loans to fix my debt to income and then use the other 150k down on that 450k house to make it more affordable? Am I way overshooting for my income? It would be out of town so no utilities to pay so that extra $150/mo bill could also go towards mortgage costs as well. Also current house mortgage is only 740/month on a 15 year mortgage but am sure I could rent it out for 1000+/month but then I’m not getting all that equity for next house. Could that be added income? Looking forward to anyone’s guidance and thoughts!",personalfinance,1636666447

8,Should I spend half my income on a 1 room apartment? details inside,"Hello, I live in EU and i'm working as a Janitor, I earn 1220euros/month (no overtime avabile), my contract ends in the middle of June 2022 when I'll start getting unemployement for the summer period (i'll be getting around 650-700euros) and resume working fulltime again in september/october 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

right now I live with 3 flatmates and i'm paying 270euros/month + expenses for a single room with fullsize bed, the house is big, we have a nice garden, multiple bathrooms, it's near the center and work (I bike to work, it takes 4mins on average), the only downsides apart from having to live with other people (i'm 29 and kinda sick of having to split a house) is the noises that comes from my window in the room, I can hear every single thing happening outside and sometimes it wakes me up at night (mostly people talking and passing by), luckily the road outside my window is used quite rarely and no car can use it (only moped sometimes), also the house is pretty old so we pay quite a bit in heating during winter, on average I think I pay 320-350euros/month with all expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

I just found a 1 room apartment that's priced 650euros all expenses included (wifi too), it's marketed as a ""luxury"" 1 room apartment with complete soundproofing, triple glazing windows, all the kitchen utensils you could think of, heated floors, balcony, parking spot (I don't have a car tho), it's still close to work (a 5min walk). it loooks great but it's kinda small, here are some pictures from the ad

[https://imgur.com/a/MZZA7GA](https://imgur.com/a/MZZA7GA)

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it would be stupid for me to get this ""apartment""? Is it reasonable? am I shooting too high?  I have an appointment to see the apartment tomorrow and I'm thinking about it

&amp;#x200B;

I made some calculations, I earn 1220, rent is 650, food is probably 200-250euros if I want to treat myself from time to time, I basically don't have any other fixed expense (my parents pay for my phone plan just because, about 15euros/month), let's put 120euros towards random stuff/stuff to buy, at the end of the month I'll be left with 200euros to put towards saving.

The summer period will be worse, I'll have to do some freelance work online just to get by, it's probably doable, but is it worth it? I'll have my own space but I'm sacrificing everything to get it, my income is not high enough to sustain it without burning everything for it, I won't be able to save anything for trips/future needs, in a year or two I may be able to obtain a better paying job (just marginally, about 150-200euros more) but for the time being this is what I have.

After writing all of this out, I think I'll have to pass and stick with my flatmates despite not liking it but I'm still posting this to gather some opinions",personalfinance,1636666239

&amp;nbsp;

So my new company has these Health Insurance plans offered from United Health above. We have the dilemma of buying a home next year and would like to save as much money as possible. The other side of it, our medical expenses were pretty high this year due to mainly my injuries and physical therapy (which is all good now, I'm currently out of PT).

&amp;nbsp;

Any other year, we only go to the doctors for preventative care and maybe the occasional Urgent Care for the kids. Does going with the CDHP plan justify around $8000 in annual premium savings that PPO would otherwise cost? Maybe use the money we save up and just pay out of pocket and hope we don't have to spend more than $8000 during the year?

I have to decide by next week, so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",personalfinance,1636666009
11,"Business vehicle purchase, losses, and a full time job","In the next year I have quite a bit of irons in the fire as I work to rebuild my income and take control of my career. Here's some of the specifics:

&amp;#x200B;

* Moving from Married to Single rate in December
* Current income is \~92k a year plus a 20k bonus
* I have two dependents, but can only claim one after 2022
* I claim 0 on my taxes currently (yep, giving the gov't an interest free loan)
* Starting an investigation agency, LLC filed last week, business to begin in early 2023
* Wanting to purchase a business use vehicle (possible electric jeep so it blends in and is silent)
* No commercial office: will use part of my house as my work office. Possibly an office in 2024 as I transition to more corporate clientele. 
* Will transition out of my FTE job once (if) the money rolls in from the agency in late 2024/25 or beyond

&amp;#x200B;

I do expect a loss of sorts in 2023, potentially. Hard to say right now as not much is spun up. The vehicle is probably the biggest purchase decision. There's lease vs. loan, used vs. new, and electric vs. gas. Electric would net me a possible $7500 tax credit, and a $9500 state credit. I would not be purchasing it with my LLC due to insurance being too high here in Oklahoma.

&amp;#x200B;

16,Best Game Plan- 90K Student Loan w/Navient (Aidvantage),"FYI- I also posted this in the Student Loan Sub. But figured I could find more advice here. Thank you all. 

$90,000 balance. Payments have obviously been stopped because of COVID. Payments will start again Feb 1. I never made payments to begin with. See below.

Background: A bit insane. These loans are from over a decade ago. I've never made a single payment on them. Original loan was around 60K, and I've been using forbearance and anything else possible to avoid making payments for the last 10 years. That interested accrued to what is now $90,000. That backstory is a novel, and I'll save it for another day.

Current: My entire life and financial situation has changed drastically over the past few years. So I'm done playing the deferment/forbearance game and ready to tackle these, mainly for my first home purchase.

I now make around $300K and I've set aside 50K in cash specifically to make a lump sum payment in February to knock this balance down, then start repaying monthly. Most likely make a final lump sum payment at the end of 2022 to clear the balance entirely.

I guess my question is how do I make these monthly payments (from Feb-December) low as possible? Do I pay down 50K, then refi, then make monthly payment until I pay off balance at end of year? Do I refi, then pay down the 50K, and then make payments till end of year when I make final lump sum payment?

Interest rate is 6.8%. My credit is very good these days as opposed to when I took the loan. So maybe an improvement could be made with the rate for those 11 months. I just have no idea how this works.

I really appreciate any suggestions or guidance here. Thank you.",personalfinance,1636664433

They don't really believe in budgets (they feel ashamed when they realize they can't 'afford' something and proceed to buy it anyway to calm that shame). They don't use online banking and still manually subtract each transaction from their bank account balances.

I am not interested in info about how leasing is not a good idea or etc.  We lease this car because it works for us.  We leased a 2020 Hyundai Sata Fe and we have just over 1.5 years left on the lease.  It has been attempted to be stolen twice now and we are frankly afraid to have the car anymore.  Car max,  the Hyundai dealer and other dealers are offering us 29K for the car.  Our lease buy out is 22K so we have equity in the car.  Car max nor any of the other dealers are willing to do the lease buy out for us,  so basically they are telling us to cut a check to the Hyundai financial to buy out the lease, get the title, and then take it to them to get their check.  Here are my questions.

If we buy out the lease will it affect our credit rating because we did not complete the lease?

We have the 22K in cash,  but it is really all the cash we have.  Is this a smart move?  We would get it all back plus over 5 grand to put towards a new car but it will leave us with nothing for a few Days/weeks.  

How long would it take for Hyundai to send us the title?  

I think these are special circumstances because Hyundai are getting stolen around here like hot cakes and we do not feel safe with the car anymore.   There is a knowledge among criminals that in the Milwaukee area that Hyundai and Kia are easy to steal, and instead of doing a recall Hyundai decided to give out Free steering wheel locks.  

Our car was first attempted to be stolen in September and it took 7 weeks to get it fixed because the parts are on back order because so many are stolen

We had it back for one week and then it was attempted to be stolen again and we have been quoted another 8 weeks before we get it back So when we do get it back it will have been not drivable for about 16 weeks

Funny enough our Sata Fe is not one that is easy to steal.  When we bought ours it had an immobilizer on it but the thieves do not know this and they break the window and tear out the steering column but cannot get it started and then just run away

I've found a few used cars locally all around $25K and 50K miles that have the features I'd like, but not sure if it's worth it due to the crazy used car prices right now.

(I can see, that we should first use our money if we have it, it's just not fair at all. Our mum has been paing the whole of our alimony over the last year - if she had'nt, we'd be already well under 5000€. Why would she have to pay and not him? + Also he's a very bad person.)

84,Incorrect date on debt collection.,"Hello,

I'm not sure who else to turn to for information, so I decided to post here.  6 Years ago Verizon scammed me out of about $400, I won't go into how they pulled it off but I decided out of principal I wouldn't pay them. I was also in my early twenties so I didn't really care about a credit score. Anyways, I believe Verizon held onto the debt for 3 years then passed it onto a collection agency.  That would be fine an dandy, but the debt states that it is from 2018 instead of 2015, when I left Verizon.  This is a big deal because it would normally be getting near the time the debt rolls off your credit.  First, is this legal for them to claim? I have tried disputing it several times but I get denied each time.  It probably doesn't help that Verizon has no information on me, so the only proof I have is a document from T-Mobile that shows I have the same phone number and it was transferred to T-Mobile in 2015. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask this now because the debt collection agency has offered this if I pay only half the debt, ""We will request the credit bureaus delete the tradeline approximately 30 days after the final payment has been posted that resolves the account"".  As I stated they have given me an offer to pay only half the debt to resolve the account. I'm thinking of buying a house soon and would like to give my credit a boost so I have been thinking about paying it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would prefer to get this corrected to the right date and let it roll off, since neither Verizon or this debt collection agency truly deserves the money (since I was scammed out of the money in the first place) but don't know if that is really possible anymore. Also, will the credit bureaus truly delete the debt?  I once was told that due to the fair credit reporting act, things like this could often not be changed because the credit report has to be accurate by law. Although they could mark it as paid. Lastly, what are the chances that this credit agency turns around and sells the other half of the debt to another agency (Which happened to a friend of mine before, but they were able to dispute and remove the debt, though they had to do it twice in two years to finally fix it).  

Any help would be greatly appreciated. As I see it I have three options, find a way to have the debt corrected and let it roll off, pay the debt and (potentially) have it removed, or let the debt rot and hurt me with a mortgage.",personalfinance,1636654324

94,Reinvesting Inherited IRA,"Apologies if this has been answered a thousand times before, but I could not find anything in my searches. Recently acquired an inherited IRA. It has been sitting for a couple months with no movement since inheritance. Are there tax penalties for purchasing FZROX and letting it accumulate in the market?

95,Ira or stock house purchase decisions,"Hello! So my question is simply complex and o am hoping for some education as I close on an investment property soon and need to make the down payment.

I am over thinking this as well. My options are as follows:

1) Sell my stocks and pay the capitol gains tax next year.

2) Withdraw from IRA for the down payment, and then sell my stock within 60 days, and deposit that back into my Ira. Essentially this way allows for a bit of extra time to defer capitol gains tax.

17,Need help making an informed decision on weather to trade in my car it not.,"I'm currently driving a 2020 Subaru Forester. It has 30k miles and the warranty expires at 36k. I have had numerous warranty claims with this car for engine, transmission, and in-car electrics problems but nothing was fixed by Subaru and all of my claims were ""swept under the carpet."" I got the car for $5k below MSRP and the out the door price was $30k. I still owe $15k on the Forester at 0% APR. 

Having given up on trying to get it fixed under warranty, I am thinking about replacing the Forester with a 2022 Toyota Tacoma. The most recent quote I got for trading in the Forester was 33k, while the Tacoma is going to coast around 37k out the door. I will need to put down $5k in cash from savings and take out a loan for about 15k over 60 months to be able not purchase the Tacoma, but that would be at 4% APR which means the interest will be close to $1.5k. 

Something to mention as well is my weekly gas expense is $60 and it will be 30% higher in a Tacoma. 

Not sure if I should keep driving the Forester and risk losing value on it if it breaks outside of the warranty period (warranty will end in about 2-3 months) or stretch my budget and get a the Tacoma which means I have to take out an expensive loan and put down cash on top of my trade in and pay more for gas as well.

One of the biggest reasons I'd want to sell it is the backseats don't have headrests and I have a baby so I can't put up a mirror to see when I'm driving. Small reason but peace of mind is nice. 

If we sell it, I would drive our Tahoe. My commute is through the suburbs, a bit hilly, and about 10 miles each way. So if we sell, the savings on insurance would be negated by the increase in gas, and wear and tear. 

But I think the plan would be to buy another used sedan down the road when prices get better, so driving the Tahoe would be temporary. I know the private party value on my Mazda has gone up quite a bit so I know if we do sell, now would be the best time.

I started straight out of college at $55k and was fairly happy with the pay. I then got bumped about to $56.5k and am at $58 now. The raises are in line with inflation, but nowhere near what they should be for someone in my position. Doing some research shows me that I should be around $80k-$95k depending on where I look so I think $85k would be more than reasonable.

40,Significant credit drop before closing,"My fiancé and I are in the process of closing on a home and I was told that my credit would be checked again on the 15th of this month before closing. We close on the 30th of this month. I already called my loan officer and let him know of this. He said we should be fine as my hard pull of credit (when I first applied for the loan) is good for another ~100 days and that they typically just check for new large debts. But he did say there is a possibility of them also checking my score which would probably make us lose the loan. The loan is 100% in my name by the way.

What happened was that we missed a payment on a credit card that recently changed banks. Our fault though. According to Mint, my score dropped 95 points, down to 645 due to this. 

We already called the credit card company and they said they can’t clear the derogatory remark. They did say we can fill out a form and mail it to our credit card company to ask for the remark to be removed. The only issue being that the next credit pull is only a few days away on a Monday so the remark wouldn’t be removed in-time.

After looking into this more on Google it seems like we should be fine but is anyone able to provide some insight on whether we will be fine or should be worried that we might lose the loan?",personalfinance,1636645941

I want to first admit that I'm not well-versed on the intricacies of leases. I understand my basic options, though, and I think I'm going to go ahead and buy my car.

In 2019 I signed a 3-year lease on a 2019 Toyota RAV4 XLE. Because of the you-know-what and working from home, as of today it has 14,200 miles on it and the lease will be up this May. I absolutely adore this car and like I had mentioned I ideally would love to just buy it at the end.

I've done a little searching and according to KBB the value of it for trade-in is \~33K and some used car listings on it put the value of it at \~25K or so. According the lease agreement, so far I've paid 17,569 and the buyout amount on it is 18,610. The car is in excellent condition with just a few scratches on the exterior. Otherwise it runs perfectly and has always been kept up with oil changes and maintenance.

If I'm understanding how these things work correctly, the dealership basically made an estimate to what they believe the car would be worth at the end of the lease. Obviously because of the inflated car market their guess was way off, but this benefits me, right? At first glance this seems like an absolute win for me, but I wanted to make sure I'm right. I also wanted to know if there's anything I should know when I go in to talk to them about this. Are there any tactics I should look out for on their end? And are there any scenarios where any other lease-end options would be more beneficial, or is this the best one?

Now, I've just learned that my office won't be reopening until April 2022. As it is, we rarely drive our Escape. Maybe just once every few weeks if we go camping or biking.

The Escape is completely paid off, and we bought the Mazda in cash. In this crazy used car market, it looks like other 2017 Ford Escape SEs (with 40k miles) are currently being resold for \~$19k, which is actually more than when we bought it used for $17k in 2019.

I feel bad that we almost never drive this car, and are paying \~$180 in insurance per month. We likely won't need two cars for another 5 months. However, I am on the fence about selling since we'd still need a second car come April.

50,I'm depressed over my financial situation. How should I handle my current situation from here on out?,"I'm a 25 year old male. I currently have 4.5K in my bank. That is all of the money I have to my name. I had around 20k saved around this time last year and ran into a problem with sports betting. That problem does not exist anymore. I have not bet in a long time and have no urge to do so. My eyes are set strictly towards tackling my financial situation. 

I currently work in the marketing field and make $17 an hour. After taxes I bring home $2,120 a month.

My current monthly spending is as follows:

$375 Car Payment (4.5 years left)
$430 Refinance Payment (starting in January)
$160 Invisalign (3K balance left)
$100 Insurance 
$250 Groceries 

I inherited my deceased relatives house and renovated it into an upstairs/downstairs apartment. I live downstairs and another family member lives upstairs. The family member handles utilities and I pay half of the taxes. My family member also pays my phone bill. It is part of the agreement of them living rent free. I obviously do not pay any rent either. So I have that going for me for the time being... but I don't want to stay here forever. 

I had $79,000 in private student loans at an extremely high interest rate (9%), but I did a cash out refinance of $80,000 on my current property to pay it all off. That is what left me with the $415 Refinance Payment for the next 30 years. 

I also have 30K in Federal student debt but I work for the government so I'm enrolled in PSLF. My monthly payment on the federal loans is only $20.

In May, I begin a new government job making $55K that will continue to raise up to $77K after 5 years. 

I am just so stressed out and down about how much money I currently owe. All that is on my mind now is saving money. I haven't went out with my friends in over a month because I have been upset and don't want to spend anything. I want to be more financially responsible but it is depressing when I can't get my mind off of finances. I also would like to live a bit in my mid 20s and have some fun. I know I won't be this age forever. 

Anyways, what should I do with the money I do have? I have a plan to have $9k saved by the time may rolls around. Part of that will be because of my $2K tax return.

52,(US) Need second opinion(s) on whether to opt in for an HSA for the upcoming year,"Benefits enrollment season is upon us and in the past year I've learned about the fabled HSA, so now I'm trying to figure out whether I should go for it or not.

Here's where I'm at financially:

* I have no debt

* I have an emergency fund built up

* I'm currently maxing out both my 401(k) and my Roth IRA

* I still save a good amount of money otherwise that I put into index funds

* I have no immediate financial goals - just trying to save enough money to eventually get a house


Now the HSA pros &amp; cons:

* *Pro*: After doing some quick math, I would save $792 in taxes

* *Pro*: I would be able to max out the $3600 contribution limit per year

* *Con*: The new plan requires me to pay in full for every doctor's visit until I meet the $5000 deductible - historically I've gone to the doctor (read: urgent care) 2 - 3 times a year, which comes out to ~$1200 ($300 - 400 a visit).  Current co-pay is $30 for primary care and $60 for specialists.

I get that I can use the HSA money to pay for the bills (what it was intended for in the first place), but I'm unsure whether it would end up as a net gain for me.  Do you think that the money I would save in the long run outweighs the potential costs?",personalfinance,1636644918
53,My leased vehicle has a residual much lower than its value. Are there options for me to recover value other than buying at end-of-lease to sell immediately?,"2.5 years ago I leased a Hyundai Kona Ultimate on a 3-year lease. I traded in a vehicle that had $5k or so in equity, so I got some nice low payments ($225/month or so). I leased for that term because for years I've been planning to sail semi-permanently as soon as my kids both started college. I've bought a sailboat and I'm preparing to sail to Mexico in the next 10 days where I'll work remotely at anchor.

I'm wondering if there are any easier options, such as the dealership paying me some sort of premium when I return the car, or is my only option to buy it end-of-lease and sell to take the $10-12k profit myself?

58,Roth IRA Conversion - still make sense if taxes paid from separate Roth account?,"So will have an uncharacteristically low earnings year this year putting me in the 12% bracket.  Already have enough savings to ensure I'll be in the 22% bracket come retirement.  This means it would be a great time to do a Roth IRA conversion to maximize earnings under the 12% bracket and have flexibility to manage roth withdrawals to potentially maximize tax savings in early retirement years (for example: helping to forego SS payments until 70yrs old for larger payment).

However, not yet sure if taxes could be paid out of a taxable account or if would need to pull the taxes from a separate roth account.  

Is it still wise to do a Roth conversion if having to pull money out of a separate roth to gain flexibility on withdrawals? 

For example, is it wise to lose tax deferred benefits on 12% of your account if it will save you at least 10% in taxes on the other 88% of your account later?  Rounding up, let's say I'm currently 40yrs old with 30yrs of tax deferral on gains before taking RMD's.",personalfinance,1636644633

63,"To Parents Who Feel Uncomfortable Talking With Their Children About Money,"," Why do you feel so uncomfortable when talking to your children about anything related to money or finances?

Speaking to your children about investments and financial decisions is extremely important and should be one of the most important things to teach your children while they are growing up.  Being able to explain your poor financial decisions to your children could prevent them from making those same mistakes in their future.

Your family should be told if you do not have enough money saved in the event of an emergency. It might be hard to tell your family if you do not have money put aside for something that could financially ruin you, but it is important to explain why that is and how you would go about finding a solution.

Saving money to be used in the event of an emergency is a very important part of money management. If you don’t talk to your children about money management, they will be slower to learn how to spend their money wisely. They may also make the same mistakes you have in the past that could be easily avoided if you discuss those mistakes with them.

My parents are very open to me and my siblings when it comes to talking about money. They let me know how much money they make per year and don’t feel uncomfortable with talking to me about how much our car and house are worth. Due to my parents’ openness about money, I have learned how to save money, and be mindful of how I spend money.

There are times when it might be better to not talk about money with your family, like when you buy a gift or present for someone, but talking about finances to people you know and trust is a good way to compare how you are saving and spending your money.

Money should be discussed with your children, and you shouldn’t have to feel like your income is a closely held secret.

2nd question: if so, would this mean I can't take the standard deduction on that income? [This](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp) seems to imply that's the case.

however i have some reservations. my husband and i bought a house six months ago, and while we are not strapped for money, we haven’t really been able to add any significant amount of money to our savings other than 401k contributions due to some issues coming up with the house.  we also both work from home right now and have enough family that have helped us with the baby that we havent needed to pay for daycare, but i’m starting to realize that this is an unreliable solution and will probably have to pay for at least part time daycare in the near future. 

my reservations come from the job itself. i was already apprehensive about going back to work, and right now i stop at 5, don’t have to deal with a lot outside of work hours, and feel like i can maintain a fairly good work/life balance. my boss assured me that that wouldn’t change, but i don’t want to take his word for it only to be backed into a corner when it does.  but i also know that if we have to pay for daycare, our finances will be tight and i would like to be able to start adding to our savings again in the near future. we don’t have any debt other than our mortgage and one car payment. 

i talked to my best friend about it and she advised me not to take the job for several reasons. one, she thinks higher paying managerial roles are the first to be let go in bad economic times, which i can see.  she’s also worked in the corporate world herself for years and said that they will promise me whatever i want, but more pay equals more responsibility and that my work life balance will go out the window. i kind of  agree, but i also don’t want to put myself in a situation where i have a decent salary but feel like i don’t have any money, and i’m already starting to feel that way. 

i’ve gotten proteins in the past and never hesitated, but the baby changes things. i don’t know if my hesitations are legit or if i’m just in new mom mode and it’s just brain fog holding me back (i’m really tired, lol.)

any advice is appreciated.",personalfinance,1636642265

I'm currently a salaried social worker earning $65,000. I love the work and my boss and everyone here loves me; I'm one of the highest performers. After 2.5 years my boss finally told me she's working on a raise for me. This job offers dental benefits and 401k matching. Note, I do not need healthcare due to my personal situation and I only need dental benefits.

I've been interviewing for ABA Therapist jobs where I'd be fee for service, independent contractor. I only started interviewing because I never thought I would get a raise here and regardless the raise will not double my pay. The jobs I'm interviewing for all pay $60-65 per hour, which is double my current hourly pay, and supposedly I can work 40 hours per week. This equals a six figure gross pay.

* Agency 1: $65/hour, health, dental and commuter benefits, they'll let me know end of the week

* Agency 2: $60/hour plus $900 bonus each month, no benefits, they offered me the job

* Agency 3: Most likely $60/hour with 401k matching, interview is today

84,"Received money through Zelle to a closed bank account, Zelle won't tell me what bank I used when I signed up.","My current situation is this:

I have about $600 that was recently sent to me over Zelle. The problem is, I signed up for Zelle several years ago, never ended up using it, and eventually deleted it off my phone. Yesterday, upon learning I was sent money over Zelle (and not venmo/payal which I normally use) I download Zelle, attempt to log in with my mobile number and get a ""C201"" error message. I call customer support and here is where the nightmare begins.

Zelle customer support tells me the only way to gain access to my account is if I provide them with the last 4 digits and/or CV code off the card I used when initially signing up for Zelle. Since it was several years ago and i've changed banks several times, I have no idea what bank I signed up with Zelle with. I tried asking if it was one of the various 5+ different banks i've used in the last few years and they said ""no"" each time. They claim this is the only way to gain access to my account. They said there is no other way to retrieve account information or access to my account.

When I initially signed up for Zelle a few years ago, I used the stand-alone app (not mobile banking through my banks), I also don't believe I ever even sent or received money so there is no transaction history. Bank of America checked back 7 years and said I have not had an account beyond my recent unemployment account. USAA has no history beyond yesterday (when I started this process) of being linked with Zelle. My regular bank Tower Federal Credit Union is not partnered with Zelle, so I don't even think that is an option for what I could have signed up with. I'm completely lost and Zelle is being less than helpful.

How do you gain access to a Zelle account that was linked to a bank account/card that is closed and you don't even know what bank you signed up with Zelle with?

I'm just going in circles, Zelle is telling me to call my banks, banks are telling me they don't have history of being linked with Zelle and to call Zelle.",personalfinance,1636640881

92,Open Enrollment - When is a high premium plan worth it?,"Dealing with open enrollment here.  We are a family of 5, we have the option of a HDP or a ""copay plan.""  We've always done HDP (+maxed out our HSA account), but facing new challenges this year.  Our teen is transgender, and his current medication is a specialty prescription that we have been paying about $2,000 out of pocket every three months (this is after the drug company discount card which takes off $3k), plus we pay for weekly therapy, bloodwork every two months, and doctor visits every three months.  The rest of the family has minimal medical expenses, and even with two hospital visits in 2021, the out of pocket for the rest of the family was about $2000 combined.  We both work and can handle paying these expenses out of pocket when they arise, although did have to dip into some emergency funds this past year because we didn't realize the meds would be so expensive.

I'm struggling to decide if we move to the copay plan for next year.  We would pay about $3500 more in premiums, but that medication would only cost a copay of $150/quarter.  With the HDP there is an individual out of pocket cap of $7900, which we would meet for the noted child.  I've just been spinning my wheels trying to make this decision, and it seems like we would see about the same financial burden either way.  And of course there are about 70 pages outlining both plans, so more to consider than just these couple items.

Our effective tax rate has been between 11-13% for the past few years, so the tax benefits of the HSA are not a huge consideration for me.

I checked into state health insurance for that one child, which would provide better coverage at a premium of about $2200 for the year for that child, but I'm not sure if we have the option to exclude him from our employer-sponsored family insurance, in which case he would be ineligible for state insurance.  It would not make sense to put all our kids on state insurance at that rate.

Posting to see if anyone else here is using this strategy and has recommendations for next steps.

I am a CPA and own a small accounting firm. I started considering what people end up spending significant capital on over their life span and how to mitigate those costs, I apply this to my business as well but that's off topic for this conversation.

The first and most obvious is home repairs &amp; maintenance. To mitigate this and other risks I decided not create an advantages economies of scale. 

1. I invested $25k along with 2 of my friends into a real estate investment business. 

2. We picked up a flip and did pretty well on it. 

3. We got an outside investor, $100k non equity, to speed things along

4. We picked up rentals to create $3k monthly cash flow

5. We picked up 3 more flips

6. This is the key and was the original goal, we hired a crew to work on our jobs and advertised to pick up outside jobs for when the real estate company doesn't have work.

This crew will be working on my home. I'm saving $10's of thousands.

I know I’ll have to sell the amount to bring it back in balance which will end up being a violation, but does this run the risk of a prohibited transaction since this was essentially traded on margin (I guess?) I.E. a loan which is not allowed in Roth IRA.

8,Where should I put excess money?,"**TLDR, by debt, about to see big gain in usable income, I like like I'm an average person and not a high income earner, not sure what to do with my cash

Hey everyone, I constantly see great advice in this sub and could use some advice. I did read through the sidebar but my situation is a bit complicated I believe. I'll try to be brief.

I'm 31(M) and self employed. Due to personal reasons for the last 12 months I've drastically reduced my income vs what I actually earn. I've been taking an $8k/mo salary from my LLC because I have to keep my income low. What I actually ""earned"" over that time has worked out to an average of $56k/mo. 

As of Feb 1st, I'll be able to reinstate my proper pay schedule and will not have to keep a reduced income. 

I have $0 debt. No mortgage, no car payments, no student loans, no credit card debt. 

I have about $6k/mo in expenses (child care, insurance, I pay my exs mortgage/car and give her some money to help with her finances), plus basic utilities like cell phone and whatnot. I probably spend about $1k/mo on food/dates. 

I have some stocks which my uncle manages for me, my portfolio isn't large but is sitting around $320k at the moment. I do not have a 401k, o drained it a few years ago to start my business. 

Here's my question : come Feb I'm going to take the back pay for the last 15 months on my earnings. Combined with my Nov/Dec/Jan income, I'm expecting to take about $600k out of my business account as a payout. At the same time, my other business which I haven't taken a single dollar from yet will be paying me $32k/mo. 

I know I'm going to get slammed on taxes which is fine, but where should I be putting my money? As of Feb 1st I'll be ""taking home"" about $90k/mo. 

I have assets (a rental house, 5 cars, a $70k watch collection, etc) which totals up to about $600k in assets. I also have a college fund setup for both of my young children ($40k/ea) and I've setup an account with $100k/each they can access when they turn 18. 

I do have a specific car I want to buy which will be in the $200k range, and probably another house. I'll likely pay cash for the car and if interest rates stay low I'll probably mortgage maybe $200k and put the rest down in cash. 

I'm just at a loss. My uncle is my financial advisor, buy I think I'm going to get a fiduciary as well once my income actually adjusts. I just don't want people in my personal life knowing what my bank accounts look like. 

Assuming after taxes I have around $60k/mo to put wherever, what would be the best Avenue to use this money? 

One last piece of info is I'm debating accepting a buyout from by business partner. We havent finalized specifics but if that were the case, it would be a low 7 figure buyout and I'd likely stay on retainer for $10-15k/mo for a 2 year contract or so. This would only be with my first company, which is the less profitable 1 of the 2.

11,How to utilize a large savings account as an investment,"Hi all, thanks in advance for reading and helping.

My wife and I have a larger-than-normal savings account that I think I should use for investing.  Its total is about $60k.  This is split up into about $52k in true savings and $8k in checking.  We like to keep about $5k minimum in checking to pay all credit cards, bills, mortgage etc.  Whatever is left over goes into the savings account.  The idea was that savings account would be used for vacations, home improvements and ultimatley a down payment on a new bigger house.  We did have a baby about 5 months ago so daycare and hospital bills have slowed the growth of this savings.  Advice from relatives and parents is suggesting that this is relatively high and we should invest some of it to create a return. 

I do not have a big money market / investing background as you might presume.  Therefore ive always been hesitant to consider investing.  Always viewed it as similar to gambling so naturally steered clear.  We want to buy a new house within 5 years from now.  We will have some capital to use on the sale of our current house, but we will be upgrading so we will need extra money.  

What options do I have to consider?  I want to be able to utilize some of the funds within 5 years.  Am I too far behind?

May be worth noting that my wife and I have healthy 401k and Roth IRA accounts set up for us to retire on time.

I understand the (A) the difference between Vantage vs. FICO, and (B) I understand that lenders have their own formulas, but this problem ONLY happens with Equifax, not Exp or TU. 

I use both Experian App and myFico to monitor my scores. When I’m going to apply for something or make any big financial moves, I plan ahead by checking my scores, pay down any high utilizations, check for inaccuracies, etc. 

As an example, my credit score on both myFico and Experian App is 755 for Equifax. Two different unrelated lenders have now pulled my score within the same month as 660 and  672 from Equifax (DCU, Chase). As a result, I was approved for mediocre APR and limits on the products I applied for. I didn’t get declined, but it’s discouraging. My income is in the range of 90k (household is about 180k).

Both calls came through on the same mobile number.

First call had me a little confused because it took a bit of effort to find out why he was calling. He was really vague and only said the company name and his first name and it wasn't very clear. Sounded like he was from somewhere around Netherlands/Germany. And then he mentioned he's seen I've shown interest in trading (I haven't, ever). After I said the first time round that I didn't know how he got the information he insisted that my wife must have sent the response to them. I laughed and hung up, I'm not even married or anything.

Second call I got he started with the same info as if we'd never spoken before and I mentioned he's called before and it's just plain annoying as I have no interest in this. I asked him to stop calling and remove my number and he changed and said not until I agree to join him and what he's calling about. I told him he's making it up and it's getting stupid and that I'd basically send the number to the police and all that crap. And then his tone completely changed and he raised his voice constantly asking if I'm calling him a liar.

23,1099 tax questions,"Hi everyone,

I am not sure if here is the right place to post this question, please let me know where I should post if I am at wrong place. 

Earlier this year I did some 1099 jobs like uber eat, amazon delivery etc. I made about $10,000. 

After some research I learned the tax for 1099/self employed is higher than regular w-2 job which I would like to minimize to save my hard earn money.  

The fastest and simple way I found online is solo-401k. 
If I understand correctly I can deduct up to $19,500 each year. 
Is that meant I don't need to pay any tax on this 10k if I contribute all 10k I earned from 1099 jobs to a solo-401k account?

I havet pay or withhold any taxes for this 10k since beginning of this year, do I need to do it if decide to put everything in 401k?

25,Employer Accidentally Paid Me During Leave And Want Paid Back,"I went on maternity leave this year and it was a nightmare. The actual maternity leave policy with my company is great, but it goes through so many third parties I was misinformed several times as to what to provide, what would happen, and what I’d be paid and when.

The entire leave was 12 weeks. The breakdown is as follows. First, a portion of my leave was 100% paid as maternity leave. Then it got fuzzy. One party stated it would maintain 100% during short term disability, the other said it would drop to 80%. I live in Washington, where there is paid leave through the state, so when I report that my employer only covered 80% of my check Washington provided the other 20% as a direct deposit to me. Then it got FUZZIER, because I was told at the beginning by the party that was INCORRECT about STD previously that the last two weeks would be unpaid. I ended up actually getting paid those last two weeks and just assumed they’d been incorrect the entire time. Thought nothing of it.

Two weeks into being back at work I don’t have a check (one week’s worth of pay). It took them a week to investigate after I reported it. The leave department just reached out to me and said the check was withheld because there was an error in being paid my last two weeks. That check was put toward the owed gross amount but there is still about $900 left.

My issue is that due to the company’s error in paying me, I reported to Washington for those two weeks that I had been paid and declined accommodation through the state family leave. So I am now $900 in the hole when the entire time I was told I’d be covered 100% throughout my leave and planned according financially.

They didn’t withhold the next check I received but now want me to repay them. How do I resolve this? Due to their error I missed out on two weeks paid leave that I had financially planned for through the state and now owe. With my son’s hospital bill, savings are gone, so this 900 I owe is going to put us in a horrible situation for a while.",personalfinance,1636632476

32,What should I look for in a car finance?,"  

Buying a car is exciting, but getting a loan may be challenging. Here are a few things to keep in mind when applying for a vehicle loan. The second most important purchase you will ever make is purchasing an automobile, which is only second to purchasing a home. Rather than turning over cash to pay for a vehicle, most individuals check into getting a car loan, whether the vehicle is new or old. Because a vehicle loan accrues interest over time, it is critical to be well-prepared before taking out one. Before you apply for a vehicle loan, keep these five points in mind.

· **Compare interest rates to find the best deal.**

Before taking out a vehicle loan, compare the interest rates given by several banks or financial organisations. Because there are no standard rates on the market, even a little variance in the rate of interest can have a significant influence on the amount you must return the lender. The interest rate ranges from floating to fixed and from lender to loan. Obtain quotes from a number of different automobile dealers. Because each auto dealer has a distinct relationship with a different lender, you may receive a variety of bids on interest rates and other fees. This can assist you in comparing the various offers while also assisting you in finding the greatest bargain for your vehicle.

· **Documentation that is exact and thorough**

Before you apply for a vehicle loan, compare the interest rates given by several banks or financial organisations. Because there are no standard rates on the market, even a little fluctuation in interest rates of a few percentage points can have a significant influence on the amount you must return the lender. Interest rates range from variable to fixed, and they change from one lender to the next. Collect quotes from several automobile dealers. Because each auto dealer has a distinct relationship with a lender, you may receive a variety of interest rate and other fee quotes. This can assist you in comparing the various offers and choose the best bargain for your vehicle.

· **Choosing the right loan payback period**

The loan repayment terms are the most crucial aspect of a car loan. Some lending executives may try to persuade you to choose a loan that appears desirable to you. For a seven-year loan, for example, you could be charged a lower EMI amount. However, if you compute the entire payback over seven years, you could be surprised. Since a result, it's a good idea to choose the shortest loan payback period possible, as this will save you a lot of money in the long run.

· **Calculate your monthly payment, processing fees, service tax, and foreclosure penalties for your loan.**

Fortunately, many financial websites now include simple EMI calculators that can help you predict your monthly EMI depending on the interest rate, allowing you to choose the best interest rate and loan for your automobile. Also, keep an eye out for processing costs, since different lenders charge different fees, so comparing several loan alternatives will help you make an educated selection. Similarly, you may need to investigate whether service tax should be paid as a one-time lump sum payment or on a regular basis. Foreclosure fines are another crucial consideration. The majority of buyers are unaware of the foreclosure clause, and because different lending institutions have different foreclosure rates, it is critical to choose your lender carefully.

· **Examine for strategies and deals.**

Almost every bank or lender that provides auto loans has a variety of appealing offers and bargains. With a good credit score, you could be able to get a special bargain, and in certain situations, you might even be able to get a 0% interest rate on your auto loan.

It's critical to understand the numerous elements that might influence your ability to obtain a vehicle loan. Seek guidance from a loan officer or an authorised auto dealer while also conducting extensive study on the numerous possibilities available to you.

€7000,- in savings. Interest 0,01%
ETF €3000,- 70%stocks 30%bonds averaged a 10%ROI at ROBECO.
Crypto €6000,- 50%ROI

As you can see the savings has the lowest ROI (shocking right). However, this 7000 is meant as a down payment/buyer's cost for a house (in 1year/3years). 

Now I am thinking on depositing the majority, if not all of the savings into ETFs (thinking a bond ETF), to combat inflation and as this money is not a necessity right now.

45,How does car finance work?,"Car financing doesn't need to be complicated, and once you understand the fundamentals , you will be better ready to find the proper car financing plan for you.

Financing a car might be worrisome, especially if you're a first-time buyer. Despite the fact that buying a car is one of the most significant transactions most individuals will ever make (second only to purchasing a home), understanding auto finance does not have to be difficult.

The cost of financing an automobile is added to the final cost of the vehicle.

Once you've chosen on a car, you have two payment options: purchase in full or finance the vehicle over time with a loan or lease.

The majority of automobile purchases require financing, however you should be aware that borrowing raises the vehicle's total cost. This is because, in addition to the cost of the car, you'll be paying for the cost of credit (interest and other loan fees).

Financing a car with a loan

When utilizing a loan to finance an automobile, there are three important aspects to consider: the loan amount (the total amount you're borrowing), the annual percentage rate (commonly known as the APR, which is the interest rate you pay on your loan), and the loan period (the amount of time you have to pay back the loan amount).

When financing a used automobile rather than a new one, interest rates are often higher, so browse around for the best deal. To discover how alternative loan amounts, APRs, and terms may effect your monthly payment, use the Bank of America vehicle loan calculator.

Also, seek for a car loan that does not charge a penalty if you pay it off early. If you opt to pay off your debt, this will save you money.

## Financing a car with a lease

Most people associate auto finance with taking out a loan to purchase a car, but leasing a car is also a common option.

When you lease an automobile, you just pay a percentage of the total cost—in other words, you're only paying for the use of the vehicle, not the vehicle itself. You may or may not be required to make a down payment, sales tax is only applied to your monthly payments (in most states), and you are charged a financial rate known as a money factor, which is comparable to the interest rate on a loan. You may also be required to pay a security deposit and other lease-related expenses.

When you lease an automobile, you normally pay a cheaper monthly payment than if you bought the same car outright, but you don't earn any equity in the vehicle that may be used as a trade-in or resale value later. You may have the opportunity to purchase the car at the conclusion of the lease period, but this will usually be more expensive than purchasing the vehicle outright.

You must also keep track of how many miles you drive (most leases impose a per-mile cost after a certain amount of yearly miles) and take excellent care of the vehicle (most leases will charge you for wear, tear and damage at the end of the lease period).

If you want to keep the automobile after the lease time ends, you may be able to do so with a lease buyout.",personalfinance,1636621254

1) just pay for the repairs, wait up to 2 years to buy a larger car. at that point, try to sell the Accord and hopefully recoup the cost of the repairs today

48,I feel like we can’t get ahead!,"Some background: My fiancé and I have shared our finances for the last 5 years (together 7 years and will be married next year) and I feel like we can’t get ahead. To be fair my fiancé was the bread winner and paid all the bills for the first 5 years while I was a student, which was a large sacrifice. They’ve never mentioned it or held it over my head or viewed it as a burden and for that I’m grateful.  

In the time that I’ve know my fiancé they went from 40k/yr to just slightly over 100k. I pretty much made around 15k-32k those first five years and when I graduated was making 60k. For the year that I made 60k the agreement was that I’d use my salary for savings (emergency fund, wedding, vacations, lump sum insurance payments, maintenance, and future deposits/down payments). I was able to fund our whole wedding, all of our vacations, and emergency fund, etc., however it feels like we can never save enough for a down payment, get on tract for 401k, or increase our emergency savings to match our new income (I just started a new position making the same amount as fiancé; a little over 100k). I feel like things keep popping up, the housing market keeps rising, and we no longer qualify for any first time home buyer programs around us (which we understand why). 

After taxes (and holy cow are taxes paid out differently now that I make more; which again I understand and support…but holy cow!), 401k, and health insurance/HSA/FSA we bring home around 8k. I’ve only gotten my second paycheck and we’re looking to re-do our budget to match the new income. Any suggestions on what we can do to get ahead and start feeling comfortable while properly funding our retirement.

50,Circumstances lead me to quite a sum of money($40k). I’m still grieving and overthinking about it please advice?,"TL;DR: got some money, need to know what to do and not burn it through own leisures, what do? Please help love u!

Hi M(27) here,
So under a tragic circumstances of a family member. My mother currently inherited a sum of money and she plans to splits them between my sister and i for use in the future. It came out of a surprise at first but i kept wanting to maybe have her keep the money for now and use it for any emergencies or pay off any debts. But she tells me that she would rather let me have it but i have to use it in investing and some sort of retirement plan going.

I have probably zero knowledge of how to invest but probably reading from this subreddits for about 2 hours would indicate that i should pay off my debts and invest in mutual/index funds. I have some emergency fund thru a piggybank app that i save up and i do invest some small amount on Robinhood 

I basically living off from pay checks at work and pay quite a hefty amount of insurance and i plan to switch later on, but i have plan out to pay it off thru my credit card and the cycles of payoffs is going pretty ok so far with no complaints.(been building a slow and steady credit score as well). Beside that, Rent isn’t expensive and i basically have little debt to pay from insurances.

Right now i’m just working on building some sort of a steady income and saving for my own financial improvements.

What would your advise be in this type of situation?  
Cheers for your help! Much love",personalfinance,1636619191
51,Father is dying. How do I best manage the family estate to generate income and avoid taxes?,"So there's a few factors in play and I'm not a noob when it comes to dealing with finances; He taught me well. Thanks Dad.

We have 4 rental properties. The first roughly 800-900k in Philadelphia, the 2nd-4th are located in Baltimore and worth maybe 250-300k a piece. Also there is a house in Italy that has weird inheritance laws probably worth at least a quarter mil that I have to figure out. Probably will ask an Italian. I have relocated most of the family to Texas as that's where his treatment is (side note MD Anderson is the best cancer hospital in the world and it's not even close FYI) They generate about ~$7.5k a month, they all have been rental properties for over two years and dealing with the philadelphia one in particular has been a major pain. I plan to slowly 1031 exchange these for all texas properties or at least just the philly one. I'm trying to dodge taxes as best I can.

I just finished remodeling our other property in Bellevue, WA. It sold last month for 1.6M. 250k above zestimate and I did all of the work myself so got a great return on my efforts there. Closing costs were about 120k after excise tax and 5.5% realtor fees. Not happy to ""lose"" 120k, but that brings me to the next phase. The house was purchased 8-10 years ago for 675k and some money was dumped in, but still the gain exceeds 500k so I can't quite dodge all the capital gains.

Now there's another ~1.3 in my fathers 401k / brokerage account. I have not done the breakdown. He aimed for a 6% return with a 60/40 stock bond split. I have not touched this and I do not plan to touch it until his death as I currently understand this is best for tax purposes. These are likely long term holdings.

Now upon his death there is a 2.4-3M life insurance payout and they are currently paying about $7500 a month in disability income. He also receives about 3.5k in Social Security Income.

Cashflow is currently positive. No issues there.

Now what my plan is to slowly buy properties in Texas and rent them out. There is a good rent to property ratio here and I could double the current cashflow. I understand there is higher property taxes and some more numbers need to be crunched, but overall I think this will be a good investment since I live here and I can take care issues personally instead of having to either fly to philly or Baltimore or pay out the ass for someone else to fix minor day to day issues. I owned a general contracting company for a while and can do just about anything that isn't electrical or plumbing so this should keep my return high. I'm also in the process of getting a real estate license so I can avoid having to pay someone to open doors for me. I know how to do comps and how to find a great value house. I also owned a moving and delivery company had a bunch of realtor clients we staged for and would pick their brains on every house. I've seen the process and just did all the work on one of our houses so I'm not a complete novice there either. Perhaps will get a NMLS license and avoid paying a mortgage officer. I am not working right now, just at home taking care of my father in his End of Life phase. I have extra time to do these things.

I could also buy a relatively safe stock such as amazon with the money and sell covered calls against the stock and generate income that way. Can't avoid taxes there though. It will be short term capital gains.

Is there anything I am missing or doing wrong right now? Anything I should watch out for as far as taxes when my father passes? His will states everything will go to my mother, but she doesn't even know how to log into her bank account. I manage all the finances for my family and I have two sisters that I will evenly split the inheritance with upon my mothers death.

Thoughts on my plan? Anything I'm doing wrong you noticed from reading this? I just don't want to fuck this up. It's brain cancer and he's too far gone to ask for any advice as luck would have it he worked in finance for 20+ years so he would have been the best person to ask.

56,35% DTI in HCOL ok? Need help before buying a home,"I'm trying to figure out what is OK to spend on a house and car. I don't have many peers that can help therefore am here asking for advice.

Total GROSS income is about 27,000 per month (9500 debt a month).

Therefore our DTI is around 35% with our cars and potential house, and our savings will be around 2k a month while maxing out our 401ks and IRA. We want kids as well.

Wife and I combined make over 250k but we have not invested much into retirement. We are both in our mid 30s with 2 young kids. 

Me: 401k at work. Currently putting in 10% and company match 5%. Started job middle of this year. I just changed my 401k contribution to 90% for last 2 months so I can try to get near the max 401k contribution per year. 

I just opened up both a traditional IRA and Roth IRA today. Plan to fund 6k into the traditional and then do a backdoor before end of year.

Wife: she has zero retirement savings and money purely in her bank. She is a PER health care worker so gets no 401k. I plan to help her open up a traditional IRA and then also backdoor into a Roth IRA.  Will do 70/30 split for US and International stocks mutual funds, bonds later possibly. 

I am worried that there might be some mistakes in my thought process. Can someone double check to see if everything seems ok? My wife is very scared to invest but I am ensuring her it will be OK.

Looks like the insurance website has an option for appealing but I literally don't know what to say because I don't understand why they denied the entire thing. What's the best way of appealing? Should I call the insurance, the doctor's clinic or the hospital?

The insurance company is United Healthcare if it's relevant.

My boyfriend and I have been together 16 years. (I know, why isn't he my husband yet, he's just not, my preference🤷‍♀️) Anyway, in 2008 we bought a house because we HATED renting. We were young, barely any credit, but somehow he got a mortgage. My credit wouldn't allow me to be on mortgage, but we told loan agent and realtor we both wanted to be on title. Show up to closing and my name isn't on there. We needed to close, so planned to just add me later, but never did.  Anyway, we bought a fixer upper in a DESIRABLE neighborhood for only $47k. We did a lot of remodeling because he is good at it and did it on our own. But there's some big ticket things we never got to do. Fast forward to today, house easily can sell for $170k as is.

73,consumer proposal vs bankruptcy,"I defaulted on my 30k student debt several years ago and it has ballooned to  60k. I only take home 2k/month and I have no job security. I'd say there is about a 50/50 chance I will have my current job for the next 5 years. Of course, if I lost my job I could get another one, but that process is not always smooth. 

I have 5k because I just sold a car I don't need. 

Now, I went to a trustee and he's trying to convince me to go the consumer proposal route, making a 20k offer, which might be countered up to 25, according to him. I'd be making monthly payments of somewhere between 350-450. 450 would be very, very tight, 350 a little less so. It is doable. I'd be doing that for 5 years, although the 5k I have from my car would help shorten that. 

On the other hand, I could use the 5k to pay the trustee fees and I'd be discharged in 9 months from a bankruptcy. The thing I like about the bankruptcy option is that it's done and paid for upfront and it doesn't matter if I lose my job or have any other negative life shocks. It's done. 

What I don't like about going for a consumer proposal is that if anything bad happens in the next few years, such as job loss, I might not be able to make the payments. I'm not trying to be cheap, I really would prefer to do a consumer proposal. I'm just wondering if that's the responsible move to make, knowing how thin my budget would be and how vulnerable to shocks I would be. 

But still, I would rather avoid bankruptcy if possible. 

One other question I want to ask, and this is mostly hypothetical, but does it even matter from a lender's perspective? I know that if I went bankrupt and tried to get a mortgage a few years later I'd be turned down. But how would it be any different if I did a CP? The bank is still going to turn me down and I'm still going to need an alternative lender, aren't I?

I have done bachelor's in computer science engineering so i can get high paying jobs in IT. I'm not from USA, so let me give some details. The things is navy offers a lot more facilities(atleast that's what i think) than working in IT. In my country if you're in navy or have retired then navy pays all the medical bills of your familiy(wife,children until they turn 21, parents) doesn't  matter if it's 10$ or 10000$. Another thing is that there's include 60 days casual leave per year and you will still be paid for that duration(not full amount though). You also get to do a master's degree or any other degree, during that duration you will be getting paid your normal salary. Navy also provides you an apartment and pays for all the stuff from electricity, internet connection to grocery. They provide you with personal maids who do laundry and stuff. Amry has large stores in our country where people who have served or are serving can buy most of the stuff(from a shampoo bottle to a car) on discount, subsidized by navy. Apart from this, a lot of other perks are provided by navy. But the thing is that i might be earning more salary after 4-5 years in IT compared to what i will earn in navy. I will be getting around 1000$ in my first year in navy, it will increase every year and with rank. While in IT industry it might be less or more as a fresher, but in 4-5 years i will earning around 2000$ or even more, while in navy it will be around 1400-1500$ after 5 years. So, it will take me in navy around 8-9 years to reach that kind of salary. Plus there's no cap on how much i can make in IT. So does it make sense joining navy from financial point of view?

The problem is, he no longer has insurance because he's self employed and my step mom had the insurance but was laid off during a portion of the pandemic, which lost them their insurance. 

I did a little searching around,  and from what I've found is that he will need insurance to get on the transplant list, along with smoking cessation. 

Since it's open enrollment he's looked at plans on healthcare. Gov and is planning on buying the cheapest plan ... Which strikes me as a Real Bad Idea. 

He's had fluid drained from his abdomen twice and it's been the max amount they're allowed to take and he's still got some in there. He's been paying cash price to the hospital for all the visits and tests so far and he's used up nearly all of his savings and is no longer able to work.

Would he qualify for disability?
He doesn't qualify for Medicare as he's only 60.
He doesn't qualify for Medicaid because my stepmom makes more than $21k/year. (Ohio.)

I wanted to make a solid attempt to pay my house off ASAP, but Im wondering if I should start putting the savings into an account instead. I havent started a Roth IRA yet and that was my next plan, but Im wondering if I should start on that first. 

Background is I'm 25, make about 50k/yr and owe about 112k on my house which was appraised in april for 240k, I believe. I have a 30/yr mortgage and my payments are less than $500/mo. The way I was saving to accomplish my goal was to make ""double payments"" where I was taking the payment out of my check every 2 weeks. 1 went toward the mortgage and the other went into a savings account. This was also a secondary emergency fund so if something came up, I could make my house payment no matter what. 

Ultimately my goal was to pay off my current house, and then buy another house in my hometown that was more towards what and where I wanted, and to then rent my current house out.

However I'm wondering if I should take the savings Im making and open an IRA to get that ball rolling instead. As it sits, I can max out the IRA for the year in one contribution, and I feel I should be able to save and do that again the next year, and so on.

This is probably a no brainer and I see the logic in starting the IRA now instead of later, now. However Im still kind of torn on the execution of such.

I'm not really sure of the eligibility as this is my first time ever trying to add a domestic partner as a dependent on my benefits. We make roughly around the same amount so he isn't solely dependent on my income. He just doesn't get benefits from an employer due to being a contractor. I'm wondering a few things: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Will he technically be eligible if he made roughly the same as me (if not more)?
* Is there anything I need to provide as proof of domestic partnership? My benefit enrollment will my employer isn't not requesting proof at the moment. 
* Should domestic partnership must be registered with the California Secretary of State? We are not registered. 
* After some research, I wanted to see if only same-sex is eligible to enroll as a domestic partner? 
* If I were to add my partner to my benefits, do you know how much taxable income will be taken out per paycheck?

Thank you so much!",personalfinance,1636606895

3. How long does it take to move IRA from Merrill to Schwab? It says 6-14 days, but I'm wondering if it could be shorter.

4. Anyone know if there is any fees? I heard fees can be $50.. exactly the reason why I'm moving to Schwab..

90,who should I talk to in regards to my finances?,"Hi. So I'm a young professional and just started working 3 years ago. I haven't spoken to anyone about  investment strategies or building wealth for the future. All I've literally done is invested almost all of my income into stocks--no retirement accounts or anything. Am I supposed to find an accountant, or is a personal finance person the correct person to talk to? I'm just an employee on a W4, not a business owner or anything. I want someone to bounce ideas off of and advising me what I should be doing with my money--and simultaneously help me find strategies for reducing taxes.

Thankfully, I've done ok for myself with investments I've made and am planning on selling a % of them (both a mix of short term and long term capital gains taxes) in the near future so I think I need to speak to someone about how to best accomplish this.

I contribute the max % to get the full company match for my 401K, which is a Standard Contribution Roth Election. Is that okay?

I also have an HSA but I’m currently only putting in $900 a year. My HSA balance is currently only $1K and it needs to be $2K before I can invest those funds. 

I have an online savings account that I currently have $12K saved and my goal is to get it to at least $20K for an emergency fund. I recently opened a personal brokerage account too which my plan is to invest any money left over from bills in to an ETF; I’ll be able to contribute more to this brokerage account once I hit that $20K goal in my personal savings.

Long story short, we were talking, and all she has for retirement is about $66,000 allocated 100% to AST BlackRock Global Strategies Portfolio (ASTBRST) in a variable annuity with Prudential she was sold in 2005. The annuity date is 2059 when she will either be 96 or not alive. The investment has also only returned 16K in the last 16 years

I know very little about annuities, and the documentation she has from ""Strategic Partners Annuity One III"" is very confusing.

I went to initiate a transfer to vanguard because her ""financial professional"" at Prudential has treated her and me both poorly. That way I could liquidate and not have to deal with him, but Prudential Annuities does not accept in-kind transfers.

I am lost as to what to do and feel inadequate for not being able to help my parents. Should I liquidate the annuity and move to a three-fund portfolio for her?

I think this is why people are feeling unsettled, there has never been a time where it has been harder to safely protect your capital.

I had to move to a new city last year to start grad school so I didn't really have a choice in the first bit of the debt and then after that I guess it just snowballed? 

I make the minimum payments but I don't have enough money left over each month to pay any of it off (I'm paid $1750 graduate stipend per month then I pay $1200 rent, \~$200 utilities + phone + internet, $250 gas and groceries). I might make another post about how to save money or make the most of whats left over at the end of the month cuz lord knows I need that lol. 

Anyways I got a $2000 scholarship and I'm not sure how I should proceed. I know I can cover my base expenses and I don't shop, so all the money will go towards my debt. But should I put all $2000 towards the credit card debt or should I pay like $400 a month instead?

-Joint Checking and savings through Ally
-We want to have a small checking balance through the bank that we have our mortgage with just for the relationship in the event that we need to get additional financing or something. Is that even worth it?

Credit Cards:
-We both have the CITI double cash card but separate accounts. What would be the best way to get on one? Go with hers because she has a higher credit score?
-I have a BoA card that gets 3% for online purchase. I plan to add her to this.
-I opened a new card to buy the ring. 0% APR and is now paid in full, but we want to keep because it is the only visa we have and that’s all that Costco accepts. 
-She has a target red card. 

Retirement:
-I am in the process of getting my funds moved over to Schwab (thanks to the advice I received here)
-she has funds through her dads financial advising firm that we also hope to get moved to Schwab at some point. 
Will this be two separate accounts?

20,(California) My employer periodically withholds paychecks and paychecks often bounce. Is it worth suing?,"I’ve worked for this employer (approx. 40 employees) intermittently since the fall of 2018. Starting in 2019, paychecks often bounced after being deposited. Those checks would be replaced with an additional 10% of the check amount and given out whenever funds became available. Any fees accrued by the employee (returned check fees, overdraft fees) would be reimbursed by the employer. 

Then paychecks started getting withheld altogether. I’d have to look at my records to get exact dates but checks would be anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks late. Those late checks did not include any additional funds like the bounced ones. Once covid hit, things got better because (my assumption) our employer received PPP loans. So from ~April 2020 through September of 2021, there were no problems or delays. 

Now (November), the last 3 checks have bounced and today’s check was withheld. I have documentation from management or HR for each instance. Many people have quit (obviously) and I’ve heard rumors that they’ve settled with the owner after contacting and making a claim with the labor board. I’ve heard/read that for each late check, a $250 penalty is accrued and a % of the gross check. That’s a large chunk of change so I’m wondering if I should try to do the same. 

Main reason I haven’t jumped on doing this sooner is that it’s basically a Stockholm syndrome relationship where I defend the company even though I know they’re beyond fucked up. 

I also worry that the owner will file bankruptcy because of the amount of claims against him and I won’t see a dime. But I guess I have nothing to lose. This is a corporation in Sacramento county FYI.",personalfinance,1636599703

If someone else were asking this question, I'd tell them to finace the car, keep the investment prop loan, and use the cash for a down payment on another investment property. Unfortunately, financing another property is not an option at this time. So....

Pay off the rental (4.125%) and finance the car (probably 3% ish)?

Pay cash for the car and keep making regular payments on the rental?

Finance the car, keep making regular payments on the rental, and stick the money in an index fund (even though crazy inflation and market scariness at the moment)?

Should I-

A. Pay off my current car loan and buy a cheaper car?
I owe 28k on my current loan at 7% interest. The car is worth 24k if I were to sell it to Car Max due to the high used car market. I fear the longer I wait to sell, the larger the gap between what the car is worth vs what I owe will grow larger. Should I pay the 4k difference, then sell the car to get rid of my $686 monthly payment? I would then probably borrow a friend's car for a bit then get another car loans for approx 11k for a car that I would want to keep for longer.

50,Monthly expenses are too much. Working out a plan.,"I know I have brought this upon myself but I lost my well paying job last year right as lockdown hit. I was also going through an expensive divorce at the time and was really struggling with my mental health. I moved in with my mom after I sold my house and starting doordashing after unemployment ran out. This provided me the flexibility to watch my children while not being able to afford daycare. It took nearly a year to find a full time job (wanted to stay somewhat in my career field, stupid now that I think of it) and racked up some debt, slowly went through my savings, etc. My current job pays about 40,000 (significantly less than what i previously made) and I had to move into an apartment due to rising tensions with my step dad sooner than I would have liked. 

Now my primary expenses are rent, child support and daycare. These take up a bulk of my monthly income and make it hard to pay for bills, groceries or debt payments. I have started doordashing again recently after widdling through the last of my savings account (have been going in the hole every month even after minimizing my spending). This side gig should help a little and combined with studying for certificates (I work in IT) and looking for a better paying day job I hope to improve my situation. 

But in the short term should I ignore my debt payments and pay them off once I improve my situation? I have the ability to sell off the last of my remaining stocks, but due to taxes and stock value being less than the debt I am hesitant. The other option would be to sell my car and buy a beater, current car was purchased in full for 15,000 last year. I’m fearful of taxes from the stocks and reliability issues with the car. So I am not certain if either option is wise. I do plan on finding cheaper daycare and canceling health insurance for next year (only accepted as I would love to get back on anxiety medication but still have yet to receive my insurance cards lol).

Do I save 15% pre-tax, and then another 20% post-tax?  (Or whatever the “appropriate” percentages “should” be.)

Do funds accrued toward known annual expenses (insurance, car registration, etc.) or future large purchases (cars, vacations) count toward this savings goal?  Is it still considered savings even if I know I will be spending the accrued funds within the next year or so?  Or is it only the contributions for retirement or investments that count towards the savings goal?

I guess my brain is struggling to accept that a sum of money with an intended purpose and an anticipated expenditure date can still be considered savings.  It currently seems to only consider generalized buckets of money (emergency fund and retirement contributions) with unknown expenditure dates as true savings.

I live at my moms house (parents are divorced). Don’t have the best relationship with her as she has coasted through life by living off the men she was with and now that she doesn’t have one her low (~25k) income causes my sister and I to contribute. My income is relatively low and my expenses are somewhat higher than I would like them to be. Here is my situation:

I’m sitting at around $8,600 in Credit Card debt. 

Savings account is at $2,300
Checking account is at $3,400 with ~$1,000 in expenses coming soon as all my bills hit at the same time.

Miscellaneous: $100

I basically try to live as frugally as I possibly can. I cut out most of the things that I was blowing money on like books, video games, food, and other random things, but for some reason I still don’t see my accounts going up the way I would like. I go out with my partner/friends maybe 2 times a month now and even then I try to be very frugal and not buy myself expensive items and I don’t order drinks at all anymore. 

My big plan is to save as much as I can and pay off my credit cards, but I just cannot see where my money is going. My expenses also always fall between the 10th and 21st of the month so that 11 day period I just get wiped out (it’s basically an entire paycheck). I maybe just need a plan on what else I can be doing to save money or how I can pay my cards off. I completely stopped using them which is the first step, but they’re basically staying still since I’m only paying the minimum. 

I would also really like to move out. I feel like I’m living basically paycheck to paycheck like a college student who moved out too quick, but instead I’m 25 living at home with an irresponsible mother. I reap hardly any of the benefits of staying at home and not moving out.

69,Travel Credit Cards - What's More Important: How You Earn Points or How You Redeem Them?,"Have had three credit cards for past 5 or 6 years (all cash-back cards) and now I'm ready to move to a single travel rewards card.

It's overwhelming but I'm starting to get a grasp of how it all works. I'm between Chase Sapphire Preferred, Citi Premier, and Capital One Venture (staying away from the higher annual fee'd cards until I've got some experience with this).

Some cards seem to boast a better way of *earning* rewards, for instance:

* Citi includes supermarkets in their 3X point ""dining"" category, Chase only includes restaurants. The *vast* majority of my spending is in cafes, bars, grocery stores, and dining.
* Citi has 3X points on any travel purchases (hotel, airfare, gasoline) while Chase has 5X for travel but *only* if booked through their portal (Chase Ultimate Rewards) and only 2X for any travel purchases outside of that.

**And now is the other side of the coin**

* Chase seems to have a very robust rewards program. You can transfer the points to other airlines (which sometimes increases the value of the points) and they include hotels (Citi does not), 
* This is the part that freaks me out: for instance, if Virgin Atlantic is included in a card's redemption program you can book Delta tickets through Virgin because they are part of the same alliance. So when I look through the list of airlines attached to each card it feels as though you're not even seeing an accurate list of where you can redeem points.

It feels like on both sides of the coin you're splitting hairs - i.e. 2X vs 3X on a category or supermarkets being included or not in dining. Or, when it comes to redemption, having 13 airlines offered vs 17 or having hotels included or not.

TL;DR When comparing such similar travel credit cards such as Chase Sapphire Preferred and Citi Premier, what are the major differences in both spending styles and travel styles that would help one clearly differentiate between one card over the other.

Also, just threw Capital One Venture in there because it seems to have a great method of collecting points but is not as strong as the other two when it comes to redeeming them.",personalfinance,1636592557

73,Movers charged me more than on signed contract,"I'm having an issue with a moving company. They came to pick up my stuff today, and significantly overcharged me based on the cubic footage my stuff took up in the truck. I signed a contract (after loading) that said my stuff took up 417 cubic feet. I measured the stuff (and have photos of myself measuring inside the truck, with measuring tape visible) and you can see that it only actually takes up about 320 cubic feet. They called me on the phone and said they were going to charge me for 800 cubic feet, and got very angry when I challenged them on it.

I paid them, since they can ultimately hold my stuff hostage and if it came to it, I'm not willing to give it up. There is still a balance due on delivery (according to their cost based on 800 cu ft) which I plan to pay in order to get my stuff delivered and safe.

I wonder what I can do after the fact to try and recover some of the money. I have

(a) A photo of a binding estimate, signed by myself and the driver, saying that my stuff takes up 417 cu ft (and associated costs)
(b) photos of myself measuring the space that my stuff takes up in the truck

I'd honestly be fine to just rely on the signed estimate, and pay for 417 cu ft. So I guess my quest is: what authority do I appeal to if they have overcharged me based on a contract we both signed? 

The amount on the estimate we both signed is already more than I've paid. Like I said, I don't want to try and take action on this until my stuff has landed, since I worry they might not deliver some/all of it as retribution.",personalfinance,1636591484

78,I want to buy a home next year and I have money my parents both want to hand me,"I’m not in a particular rush to buy a home and I’m lucky enough where I secured cheap  rent in one of my grandparents real estate investments. However, they are planning to sell it in a year and I don’t want to pay rent when I have enough saved to buy a home. 


However the home market is insane and many are speculating a crash within 2 years. 

I make over $100K annually($80K base and rest is commission - I average $110-120), have $40K saved. 

My parents are divorced. My mother is living out of her means by living in our old large home, but when they sell the house my sister and I both each receive $100K from the home sales. My mother doesn’t want to move out just yet and wants to sell the home in late 2022.

My father who is 65 said that I can use his 401K (he lives in another country and his living expenses are extremely low, he does not need it as he is also collecting social security). 

However I just recently looked into taxes and noticed how screwed we are by not slowly withdrawing and by my dad collecting early social security at the age of 62. I also noticed that since he is not married the gift exclusion tax is at $15K rather than $30K and that the income tax bracket he will be charged is also reduced because he is no longer married. 

I have till the end of 2022 to buy a home and I really don’t want to rent. 

I was going to extract his 401K to the limit of the 22% bracket before the end of this year and do the same for next year. However the gift exclusion is what screws me. My mother said she will contribute $15K so I could get $30K from them both. However I don’t know if the system works like this. 

What are your thoughts and what should I do. I know I should have saved more and I messed up here and my goal is to save as much as I can in the upcoming months. 

My personal goal is $500K soft max, $540K hard max for an new home. The market is crazy and so far every home I saw has gotten bids of up to $100K by the asking price. 

I need to live in the area for my work and I live in ca. it’s expensive here and the cheaper options are too far. I did look in the least expensive areas but homes have gone up way too much. I would have had so many options had I bought two years ago. 

My personal expenses (car payment, insurance, internet, phone etc). Is about $800 a month. My paychecks range (with 401K withdrawn) from $5.5K/month to $9K/ month, average would be about $7K/month. This is post tax.",personalfinance,1636589583

80,Investment Property Options,"I have an investment property that is worth roughly $80K. It is a 1 bed/1 bath condo in a gated community that is close to the medical district in San Antonio, TX, so it is fairly easy to keep rented. I own the condo free and clear. I am currently renting it for $895/month.

Expenses are as follows:

Property management: $89.50 (10%)

HOA Fees: $195.29

Special Assessment Fees : $99.27 (A lot of rehab has gone into the complex lately, Only about $1200 left to pay and then this expense will go away  until they do more work on the complex). 

Property Taxes: $171/month

Landlord Insurance:  $65.24 /month

This leaves about $275/month, which I save to pay for repairs, etc. I currently have roughly $3900 in savings which I will allow to accumulate until I have around $6K, in case something big happens such as a major appliance (or A/C unit) replacement. 

I would like to keep this investment in real estate. I am in a fairly good position with my retirement accounts and emergency savings. I consider this investment as a hedge against a complete economic meltdown. My primary residence is a single family home that I am roughly halfway through a 30 year mortgage. I owe roughly $200K. House is worth \~$450K. 

I would like to grow this investment if possible. I can continue to accumulate the rent until I have enough for a down payment on another investment property. Or, I thought that i might be able to use this property as collateral to pull out equity and re-invest that money into another larger investment property such as a duplex or multi-unit complex. I was thinking about putting \~$100K down payment on a $500k property that rents for $6k a month and pay it off in 15 years (\~5K/month payment). 

Or, I could sell this investment and put the cash into some other investment entirely.

84,Double HDHP plans to get max employer contribution,"My husband just got his presentation for open enrollment and we now have a new predicament.  Both of our employers cover 100% health plans for entire family. His HDHP has a slightly lower deductible but higher out of pocket than my plan.

My husbands provides up to $1,095 per person enrolled if we join a Motion challenge where we meet daily steps/ day. 

Overall, if we both enroll each other in our company's health plans we should be almost maxing out the HSA limit at $7,206. I really want to do this but I am not sure if its legal? any trouble we can get in? 

I think the only draw back is that we will have to each meet out respective insurance deductible and out of pocket since that we would have separate primary insurance. I also read somewhere from my research that we would have to pay both Max out of pockets before the secondary can fully kick in. Is this a correct assumption?

87,Taxes/W4 questions after getting married,"Hi All,

I got married around 6 months ago, and never updated my W4 with work so I took to doing some research today on it. It's my understanding that filing taxes as 'married filing jointly' should get us a decent tax break due to wider tax bands. 

For reference lets say I make 150k a year, my wife makes 50k. I don't want to tick the w4 box for '2 jobs' since my income is triple my wife's. So I go through the w4 worksheet and see its telling me I should withhold an extra $400 (bi weekly) from my paycheck if I change my w4 to say I'm married. My wife should then have her w4 say she's married, but add no extra withholding. 

It looks like this would make my wife's take home pay go from 1600 to 1700 per check, while mine is essentially the same as it is if my W4 says im single since I added the extra withholding. With 26 paychecks a year, this would only mean an extra 2600 saved in taxes for married filing jointly.

Now lets say I just have 1 person making 200k, with w4 married filing jointly, no extra withholdings since they are the only income. Single to married on the w4 would be about a $600 difference per paycheck, or 15,600 per year. What the hell am I missing here? This doesn't make sense to me. I'm using the paycheck calculator on smart asset (which is accurate for my current situation), so is it that using the w4 worksheet we'd end up over withholding and get a refund, or am I missing something fundamental here?",personalfinance,1636587465

Are bonuses such as Profit Sharing (when paid in cash) factored in with salary when figuring a livable wage?

Background: 

I (30M) make 80k a year at a software development job and am expecting around 8k from profit sharing. With rent the way it is in my area, I'm currently not contributing to retirement or health care in order to make ends meet. I live in a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom town home in a small Utah city and paying 2k a month for it. I have a wife and two young children. 

Before trying to negotiate a higher wage or find another company, (a coworker just got a comparable job else where for 15k more a year), I was curious to hear how smarter people than I regard large cash bonuses vs larger salary?

99,Sell mutual funds versus get a Home Eq. Loan to pay for landscaping?,"Will be having about $75k of landscaping done approx. 6 months from now. Pondering the best way to pay for it. Separate from 401k and IRA retirement funds, we have about $130k worth of investments, mostly mutual funds.

The basic question is: do I sell enough of these investment holdings to pay the $75k plus the capital gains taxes (I've estimated this would be around $8k), or take out a $75k home equity loan? I guess a third option would be a combination of both, but this makes less sense if there is a clear favorite between the first two options.

Arguments in favor of taking the loan would be (i) interest rates are low, (ii) interest would be deductible, (iii) it leaves the investment money untouched to keep growing, and the historical annual ROI of our funds has been about 10%, which obviously exceeds current interest rates.

Still, I'm leaning toward using the investment money because:

* I don't like the idea of taking on more debt. Especially in the near-term, my partner's income is reduced because she cares for our toddler a few days a week, so our existing mortgage payment is currently a big chunk of our monthly income (close to half). 
* As my partner transitions back to working more over the next few years and we can afford to pay more per month, I like the idea of writing that check to myself in the form of recurring investments rather than writing that check to the bank every month, with interest. In other words, we fully intend to keep investing, and will eventually build back up these funds.
* Retirement goals are on track, max out contributions, etc. My point being, what is the purpose of non-retirement saving/investing if not to use the funds for exactly this type of project?
* We'll still have adequate emergency reserve funds even if we pay for the whole thing this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Other tidbits to consider:

* This is our forever home, period. I'm planning on dying here :)  So increases to the home's value don't really factor into the equation the way they would if we knew we'd sell someday.
* Our equity has shot way up in the past few years. Estimated home value is \~$1m, and our loan balance is about $400k.
* We refinanced in Sept. 2020 @ 2.5%. Probably should have considered a cash-out refi at the time, but didn't (shame on me).
* The landscaping is essential and cannot wait. Our backyard is wild to the point of safety hazards, and we need somewhere that our toddler can safely play.",personalfinance,1636585037

I'll need a debit card to pay his bills while  the estate makes its way through probate, checks, maybe withdraw cash?

8,Series I Bonds and saving for a house down payment,"Hi all,

I have some questions regarding Series I Bonds for the purpose of saving for a house down payment.

I currently have around $15,000 saved and will most likely need around $30,000 for a down payment based on home costs in my area- I am basing this off of 10% of the home cost(I make $45,000 a year and live in a fairly HCOL city, so saving for 20% is most likely not possible for me). My hope is to buy a house in the next 2-3 years.

I originally had the money sitting in a HYSA and was depositing $300 a month into the account. After reading the thread that talked about Series I Bonds, I decided to jump in and buy $10,000 worth. I would like to buy $5000 more in January with the remaining money that I have in the savings account.

So my questions:

1. Does the 1 year penalty apply to all new bonds purchased? So if I make a $300 automatic purchase each month, is each purchase subject to the 1 year penalty?

2. If this is the case, based on my timeline, does it make sense to make monthly purchases at all? Or to stop making those purchases 1 year out from when I plan to use the funds? 

3. Am I stupid for even putting savings in these bonds in the first place? Advice about where to put house deposit funds seems mixed, and I’m not super interested in putting them in an index fund or anything more high risk. These bonds appealed to me because of the low risk and how little interest I was getting in the HYSA. Please tell me if my assumptions about this bond are incorrect.

4. I know very little about the housing market, and while price increases are starting to slow down(especially in my city), I’m worried about spending all this time investing in these bonds and then not even having enough money by the time I’m looking for houses. While I’m hesitant to put money into riskier investments, does it make sense to do so with my timeline and what the housing market looks like?

Thanks in advance!",personalfinance,1636584073

12,"Credit score dropped 50+ points after buying house. 6 months, keeps going lower","In March 2021 I had a 780-790 credit score, when I bought a house. It dropped to 750 after buying the house, and is going from 720-750 depending on my credit utilization. Using Mint for my credit score. 

On credit specifically, I have a personal card I use for business expenses. Typically rack up $3000-$4000 in business expenses, plus $1000 in gas, food, bills, etc. This behavior has been the same for the last 3 years. 

What I’m having a problem figuring out is when/how to pay off my CC in order to keep my credit score high. 80% of the time I pay in full monthly. 20% of the time I make the min payment, then pay the remainder 1-2 weeks later. This is simply because I forget, and my auto pay does the min. 

It seems that if my credit is pulled with a balance on the CC, I’m around 720-730. If my credit is pulled without a cc balance, best is 750 - which is a far cry from 780.


Thought it would bounce back and done waiting. Getting very concerned, just got married and this is unacceptable. Why am I getting dinged so much for carrying a balance after buying a house, where it was not an issue before? Is that even the problem?


20% credit utilization is the highest I’ve gotten, and it’s never carried for more than 45 days. Min payments always made on time. No other dings on credit.

20,20/3/8 Rule: Question,"Hey everyone, I am planning on trading in my used car with 150,000+ miles on it for a new car that will be more reliable. I am buying a car (Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, or Hyundai Tucson) with the plan on keeping it for 10+ years, as was the case with my previous car. I'm hoping this won't turn into a debate on buying used vs new, the current used car market, etc., as I'm more hoping to talk about the 3 year portion of the 20/3/8 rule.

For anyone who doesn't know, the 20/3/8 rule is recommended by the Money Guy show as a smart way to finance a new/used vehicle purchase. Put at least 20% down, pay off in 3 years or less, and pay less than 8% of monthly income.

I plan to put closer to $13k (~40%) down between cash and trade-in value. This leaves me with a 20k loan. Comparing the differences between a 3 year/4 year loan, I would pay roughly $350 more in interest for the 4 year loan, but would pay roughly $140 less per month. I understand the reason to do a 3 year loan is to avoid driving a vehicle that has appreciated to be worth less than what you still owe. In my scenario, a year into owning the vehicle on a 4 year loan would result in a balance of $15k. Unless something crazy happens, I don't see how a used 2022 Honda/Toyota/Hyundai SUV would be worth less than that... does the 3 year rule of 20/3/8 really apply in this case? The flexibility in paying $140 less a month sounds nice, with the option of paying additional each month if desired. It seems like doing 4 year is just me paying $350 for the convenience of lower payments over an additional year.

Thanks for reading/any comments regarding this 20/3/8 rule, and how it has changed in the current car market and if you put more than 20% down.",personalfinance,1636583044

51,Am I over Investing my Low income and how can I better allocate my income among everything?,"Hello Reddit, long time lurker here

Essentially the title.

I'm 23 yrs old making with a 40k annual salary as a bookkeeper but since I am only working part time now it is less than that until I start working full time in January. I am also receiving $200 every month from my father who invested all my birthday money, that I received throughout my life that he is holding onto for me and that I could ask back. I am getting a Bachelors this December and possibly working towards a CPA after in 2022

I have about &lt;20k split between cash on hand, a checking account, savings account with Ally bank. Essentially my savings account is my emergency fund 

I chose to withhold more money per paycheck so about 30% of my paycheck is going towards taxes and am now getting  net $250 every paycheck. So of the 40k salary I should be receiving 28k not including the roth 401k contribution.  Net I am receiving $500 every month. I know I am giving the IRS a interest free loan but I would rather not have to pay anything when I file my taxes and I plan on keeping the extra tax withholding.

Right now I am contributing $800/month (400/paycheck) into a roth 401k and $400 into a standard fidelity brokerage account  every month. The roth 401k is investing into the 60% vanguard dated 2060 retirement fund, 20% VSLIX, and 20% VTIAX. The fidelity brokerage account is investing evenly into FNILX, FSRNX,FZLILX, AND FZROX. Starting in January my employer match (25% match up to 6% of my salary) will start.

The brokerage account is just so that my money is invested without it being locked up until retirement

I'll worry about opening an IRA after I reach the 401k limit or lose my job.

I have no real/essential expenses, I live with my parents and only pay for expenses that I take upon myself like filling up the car for my commute (about $55 every week and a half) and a $1 subscription to acorns which I am going to sell/close/cash out at the end of the year. Any expenses that I do incur are usually for a cc sub and reimbursed by my parents if I tell them but usually I don't. Usually can go months without charging anything on my CC and I have no debt/student loan obligations.

Right now is open enrollment for benefits at the company I work at and I could sign up for their high deductible health insurance to open up an HSA with fidelity to max out the 3600 contribution limit. The premium is about $55 biweekly.  (Side note: Are there any cheaper HDHP out there) 

Starting in January I will be working full time. So I should be receiving about 2K every month after my tax withholding. 1700K after possible HSA contribution, $900 after roth 401k, and $500 after the brokerage investment if I don't change anything once I start full time.  I was thinking of increasing the 401k contribution once I start full time to 1k/month

I could theoretically contribute 1500 every month to my 401k and 300 to an hsa if I stop the brokerage account investing but I'm worried I will be locking up too much into the roth 401k for 35+ year

TLDR: 40k income-12k going to tax withholding- possible 3.6k to hsa- 4.8k to brokerage- 9.6k to roth 401k

Am I investing too much and need keep more liquid assets on hand? Should I put more towards either the roth 401k or brokerage account once I start full time? Any suggestions?   Should I wait until my income is higher to invest more and contribute more towards retirement. Should I possibly invest less.

Is there any other money saving opportunities, taxed advantaged accounts and or general suggestions.",personalfinance,1636579847

This is fine and his reasoning is valid, but I just don’t like the idea of spending that much cash on something all at once. I sort of like the idea of putting $12-15k down on a $25k car, then financing the rest (my credit is pretty good). Sure, you end up paying a little more in the end than if you were to buy it all cash, but seeing that much money go away unsettles me a bit.

57,Lease buyout: is the hassle of buying out my lease worth it vs returning to the dealer early? [USA - MA],"My lease is up in spring of next year. I no longer need the car.  Some background:

* Current (early) lease buyout price according to the lender: $19K
* KBB value: $27-$30K
* My lease prohibits me from selling to a third party - I'd have to purchase the car before selling to Carvana/Carmax/Vroom/ private buyer
* I'd be buying out the lease in cash, as I don't want to bother with getting a loan for a vehicle I'm not planning to keep
* I am in Massachusetts, where I'd have to pay the sales tax on the car (\~$1200) if I buy out the lease even if I sell it quickly (no grace period) and also have to register it.

**Option A: Turn it in early to a dealer**

* **Pros: Logistically simple** \- Don't have to shell out the cash to buy out the lease; don't have to pay sales tax/ register the vehicle; don't have to wait for the title to come in from the lender
* **Cons: Not much $ return** \- Dealers will likely lowball the appraised value of the car, meaning less $ for me; I generally find dealers a hassle to deal with; would probably need to shop around a couple dealers to try to maximize my return

**Option B: Buy out lease now, sell either to Carvana or to a private buyer**

* **Pros: More $ eventually** \- I'm assuming the amount I could get for the car when I can eventually sell it is highest in a private sale, then Carvana/ Carmax, and that dealers would offer the least
* **Cons: Logistically challenging, unclear timeline, more taxable $** \- I'd need to wait for the title from the lender, go to the RMV (I know, it's weird that's what we call the DMV here!), get it registered/ pay sales tax/ get a clean title before I could sell it.

**Questions for this sub**:

1. Are there costs I'm not thinking of here? - e.g., would I be subject to excise tax (another fun thing about Massachusetts) even if I keep the vehicle for a short period of time?
2. What option would you go for? Interested in all feedback, including anything anecdotal from those who have executed transactions like this in this crazy used car market.

59,Is this monetary advice from my Dad unreasonable?,"I’m a 25 year old male living at home, mainly because of COVID.  I ended up getting a job in a different city, but it’s been entirely work from home for the past 7 months (I expected to be there by now, but the new expectation is maybe next April-June).  I’m obviously saving A LOT of money, but I really have not enjoyed this position (too boring, no challenge, etc.).  Also, this position is paying me a fairly weak salary relative to my level of schooling.  I originally vowed to “tough it out” and stay at least one year, but it’s come to the point where I decided to start sending my resume around.  I quickly found a desirable job in the same city as my current one, and it looks like I’ll have a chance to interview with them.  At the worst, it’s a chance to practice interviewing/see if I like this type of role.  Anyways, when I talked to my dad about this, he said I should only accept any position if I can secure a raise which will pay for the relocation.  Right now, I’m legitimately paying zero dollars, so of course this would require a very big pay raise (possibly between 12-14k).

I have two key reasons for questioning this. First, I already have a job in this city that will eventually require relocation.  In fact, I personally thought relocation would’ve already happened.  I was never discouraged from accepting this job.  Second, I feel like my current circumstances are very unique: this will be the only time in my life with zero rent, and it’s obvious I’m catching a big break.  Should I really be setting the benchmark for a pay raise as the increase from zero rent to the city’s level of rent?

Some other facts that should help paint a picture: I’ve saved a lot of money over the course of my life.  I’m very frugal.  Also, I have no debt.  I could technically stand to take a “hit”, if you want to call it that.

Lastly, I have no interest in staying at home for much longer.  I need to move on with my life.  I don’t think I should be restricting my job search severely just because I’m currently catching a break on rent and other expenses.  

So, let me know what you think.  My thoughts are biased due to the emotional aspect, so I need to hear it from other people.  Thanks in advance!",personalfinance,1636578621

61,Advice needed on stock classes,"The company I work for is going public, so I am faced with a dilemma:

They have given me a modest amount of stocks (RSUs), which are currently classified as “Class B” and allow for 10 votes per share. Supposedly those “Class B” stocks are not (publicly) tradable and could be held for me with a Transfer Agent.

If I don’t opt-out, the stocks will be converted 1:1 to “Class A” stocks, which allow for 1 vote per share, but are publicly tradable and will be transferred to a brokerage account.

The “Class B” to “Class A” conversion is a one way street, but if I keep my stocks as “Class B”, I could convert them at a later time, albeit with some effort and it would (supposedly) take a week.

I was thinking if I should opt-out of the conversion and keep my “Class B” shares with the idea that, since they have 10x more votes, they could (in the future) be potentially interesting to someone and could command a higher price than the “Class A” that have 1 vote and I could sell them privately (since they are not publicly tradable) for a better profit.

However, if I correctly understand the SEC filings, there are 180 million shares currently, and while many / most will be converted to “Class A” with 1 vote, some (could be quite a lot - founders, big wigs) will remain as “Class B” with 10 votes.

My shares are only 2800, which even with the 10x vote multiplier is a ridiculously small percentage of the total votes.

Is this even possible / does it even happen - someone privately buying shares with more votes for a higher price ?

There's no prepayment penalty. I asked about 5 times on that. I don't think it's precomputed interest because the amount of interest over the life of the loan is like 5.5k, and she said I wouldn't pay that amount if I paid it off early.

I am graduating university this next sunmer, and currently have two job offers I have to choose. One is for Junior Product Management for a tech consulting firm which would pay me 70k in Houston with a 5k sign on bonus. I really want to be a product management in the future so this is right up my alley in terms of my career path and development, and having the PM job title right out of college for an industry thst seems to be growing massively fast appears to be a great benefit.. They also give 10% raises every year for atleast the first 3 years, meaning I'd end up with a salary of 93k later. 

My second offer is for a warehousing and industrials firm in Chicago where I'd be training how to manage people, and eventually within a year or so I would be managing a small team in a consulting-like project. From what I hear, the work life balance is very good, but that means there's much less to do. It's a 9-5 job where you learn to do things, but maybe not as fast of a rate as I would like. Their pay is absolutely insane though. Their salary is a base of 97.5k with a 12k sign on bonus, and an extra bonus at the end of the year which averages around 40% (which isn't guaranteed but which they've paid out for the past 90 years in a row). They also pay for any grad school classes while you're working there, but I dont intend to go get my masters for quite the foreseeable future. 

I'm really conflicted about which job to pick. My first offer is the one that I feel like I would enjoy more. I'd be near the person I'm dating for atleast a year as well, which would be nice. Houston would also be cheaper, although I would need a car there and not in Chicago which may offset that?

The second job's pay is extremely tempting and appealing, but I dont know if it's what I want to do and if I will grow there in the way I want.

82,"Starting car insurance rate was $400/month 3 years ago, can't lower it beneath $200/month these days","I simply do not understand how to make this all work--can someone help me?

Backstory: I started late to driving, finally got my license at 19. Kind of a weird situation because I grew up with abusive parents that had more than enough money to help me get a car, teach me how to drive, etc., but chose not to with me (but taught my sibs how to), so when I finally got kicked out of the house at 18/19, I had to have a dad's friend teach me how to drive &amp; what to do there. 

I originally drove an '07 A4 Audi in 2018 (I know I know, it was a gift from a VERY generous friend's mom) and a car insurance brokerage from across my work at the time had me paying some $400/month to insure it. I remember getting it down to $250 (with Progressive???) a month or two later felt like a massive success. I've since driven a 2013 Hyundai Elantra (had a small loan on it), and paid some $300-250/month to have insurance through Auto-Owners, and then I got rid of that car and now I drive a 2001 Subaru Outback, and I am paying ... still $200/month. That was from Progressive. Looking at quotes from Geico today &amp; it's still $200/month. This car is so old, how am I still getting charged like this???

I really want to get this figured out because I feel like surely I'm getting scammed in some way (I do purchase renter's &amp; bundle it with my auto, otherwise it'd be $250ish) but I don't know nearly enough about insurance to figure out how to rescue myself from this slow death. Car insurance has always been a bullet to the chest for me and its driving me wild. What are the secrets??

88,Used Lexus on 70k a year.,"I recently started a new career as a financial advisor. I currently have a beat up 2008 kia rondo. But,  for the sake of meeting clients I need to get a more presentable car. I can't be showing up at some boomers house asking to take over their retirement plan in a beat up kia. 

I'm fairly mechanically inclined, so I've been looking at rebuilding a totaled 2014 or newer Mazda 6. This would cost about 8k total but would take a lot of time that I don't have.

Given my time constraints, and the fact a local credit union is offering 1% APR on car loans, I'm leaning towards getting a 2014-2016 lexus is in the realm of 20k. My down payment would be about 8k, so that would put me at around 250-300/mo for a payment. I should be able to actually pay off the loan within the next year or two with my commission checks.

I can easily afford the payment, but I keep getting hung up on this. Should I go with the lexus? or should I save myself some money in exchange for time and rebuild a salvage car? 

For reference, our household income will increase by about 20% next year, which is the primary reason I'm leaning toward the lexus.",personalfinance,1636575728

90,ESPP contributions over the max?,"The annual IRS limit for ESPP purchases is 21250.  I have been maxing ESPP out at 15% and recently I received a promotion so now the 15% exceeds the IRS limit.  I will get any overage refunded to me, but seems silly to make zero percent on this money.
  
My question is there a scenario where contributing more than max is a good thing?  I know if the price of the stock drops during the window it can result in a carry over amount you get to use in future purchase periods.  I am not 100% sure how this works and it is not easy to calculate if you have multiple purchase periods in a year.

92,Tax status on house is defaulted. How do I determine if I'm on the title deed of the house and how do I cover my ass? More background in post,"Apologies for the non-specifics. I'm being intentionally vague. 

Background: A parent passed away over a decade ago and the title of the house was transferred to my sibling and me. At least, that's what I think. I'm not entirely sure because a lot of the legal proceedings that occurred during that time are quite hazy because I was young and stupid while also dealing with my parent's decline in health and eventual passing. I've moved out of that house a while ago and my sibling has continued living there through the present.

I have just found out that property taxes have not been made on the house in a very long time. I've verified with the city assessor's office (through their official website and official phone number) that the tax status of the property is in default and subject to being sold at auction in February. The property tax balance has accumulated over the years and is quite high, somewhere in the $20k range. 

I'm unable to get in touch with my sibling so I need to pivot to cover-my-own-ass mode. How do I determine whether or not I'm on the title deed and if I am, how do I go about in navigating this? I could probably scrounge up the cash to pay off the balance but that doesn't really fix the problem of my sibling's poor financial choices.

Apparently my dad took out life insurance policies on himself (80), my mom (78) and me (43).

I don't know he exact amount yet. He thinks it is around $300,000, but I don't know that for sure yet. He is currently looking for latest statements to confirm.

As I understand it, at some point, the debt will equal the value of the policies, which will result in the policies being used to pay the debt, which will be considered income, which will of course be taxed. My father doesn't think they can afford the taxes on this.

 This is about all the information I have at the moment. I assume we'll need a lawyer and/or an account to sort all this out.

The purpose of this post is to explain my situation and wonder if I have a case and whether it is worth pursuing this in a small claims court.

\[Any help would be appreciated since that is my first apartment so I made a lot of rookie mistakes :( \]

I recently moved out of my apartment in Jack London Oakland October 31st and I am faced with a move out fee of 687 dollars. In the lease agreement the landlord (company owned) will charge a move out fee in services if they see fit.

The bill is:

1. Paint
2. General cleaning
3. Carpet
4. Other

I think the charges are ridiculous since I've only been there for one year. I mainly work from home and sleep in my one bedroom apartment. I have not had any parties, nor have I cooked. I think the apartment only suffered from ""normal wear and tear"".

That being said, on October 31st, the day I moved out I asked my family and friends to help me deep clean my apartment. Unfortunately, I only took pictures of the living room (I know really dumb).

I have three more stories I want to share (please hang on).

1. 6 months into my lease I caused a flood in my apartment because of a clogged toilet (we agreed that I would be paying through my rental insurance policy). During that time they hired professional cleaners to clean the carpet because the toilet water leaked into the bedroom. The flood also resulted in them removing the washing and drying machines. Unfortunately, one of the workers did not install the washing machine correctly because when I woke up after I washed my clothes my apartment was flooded again. The water moved into the bedroom again. All this I took pictures of and is in my cloud storage drive.
2. Next is with the walls. 3 days after that incident, the community manager told me that the washing and drying machine needs to be replaced. The next day, the workers showed up with really huge LG washing and drying machines. So huge that as they were moving machines around it banged up against the walls and doors. Resulting in damages and paint chips falling off. Furthermore, they needed to remove the door to finish installing the machines. Weirdly enough the door needed to be glue back together. For this part I also have photos in my cloud storage.
3. The last part is the apartment is just old. In one incident when I plugged in my charging cable and pulled it out again the outlet popped out of the wall. I also have photos of this in my cloud storage. The case I am making is the apartment is old and was cheaply fixed over the years.

15,"Newborn passed away, housing situation is a disaster, halfway through lending process... all advice requested!","I will do my best to explain our current situation as clearly as possible, I know there is a lot to take in:

I'll start with current financials, as I feel like that's the most relevant information to assist:

Fiancee works as a bartender, she brings in 60k-100k depending on the year.

I work seasonally as an Executive Chef, but I get paid year round at 55k / year. This opens up an opportunity for me to work an additional job 6 months out of the year, which I was in the process of looking for until this all happened. 

Savings: 20k ( This is split between Robinhood \[8k\], Checking \[2k\], and CapitalOnes savings account \[10k\]

Debt: School: I am currently in school studying Cyber Security full time, so I do not need to pay those bills but they are looming in the distance.

Car: 1 Truck is paid off completely (valued at about 22k) and 1 jeep which we owe about 7.5k ($315/month) on still.

Credit Cards: I have a gas card, and a daily usage card with a total of about $2,000 in debt

She does not have any credit card debt, we both actively pay our cards down throughout   the month.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We were living in a property rent free that is owned by my in laws, while we saved up enough money to get our own house- they had made it clear that they would assist with the new house in some way or another. During this time we got pregnant (after trying for about 2 years), unfortunately we lost the baby in her sleep on September 12th- she was only 6 weeks old. We woke up to feed her, discovered that she wasn't breathing and went through the whole process of trying to give her CPR while on the phone with 911. Obviously after this incident we all felt very uncomfortable going back, and had been staying with my in-laws who have another house about 5 minutes away from ours, and is big enough for everyone.

After staying there for a week, it was expressed to us that we did not have to go back to the other property at all- in fact, my in laws encouraged the idea that my brother and his wife move in to that property instead, so that they could be with our dogs who were not allowed to come to the bigger house. Keep in mind that my in laws go to Florida for 6 months every year, and they leave this Friday (11/12). We have all been looking at the housing market every single day, but as I'm sure you know housing is really messed up right now, and super expensive.

As our family went through the motions of trying to begin healing and getting the kids back into a regular routine, and attending counseling, my MIL began to unravel and became physically and emotionally abusive to myself, my fiancee, and even her husband. She has a history of epilepsy, and instead of ever handling the situation the family has just kind of shoved her explosions under the rug so that ""she doesn't feel bad about herself"". 

Cut to this last Sunday, she pulled me aside at 7 in the morning and told me that she was going to cook the whole family a big Sunday dinner, and then we needed to get out. No warning, nothing- just that she wanted everything to go smoothly (she normally creates big explosions, and distractions from what she's actually doing... very manipulative). When I told my fiancee the situation, she was obviously very upset, but has dealt with this sort of explosion before and asked that I just take the kids out for the day so that she could figure it out.

We ended up being told that we had until the end of the year to find a new place to live, and the kids and I came back to watch a movie and go to bed since it was well into the evening by the time the dust had settled.

The next morning my FIL took the kids to the bus stop and then was going out to breakfast. As soon as he pulled out of the driveway, my MIL began loading left overs from the refrigerator into my jeep, and other random food things: because once again, we were being told we had to leave immediately. There was a whole blow out, FIL came back immediately, but this was too much- we packed as much as we could fit into our vehicles, and left. We have been staying at my parents house while they're away on a trip, but we can't all stay here (it's too small) and they come back from their trip tonight.

The loan approval process (conventional) is almost complete, but it's based off of us having $0 rent which will no longer be the case, and that was also based off of the in laws helping with a %20 down payment, which is now up in the air (FIL is pissed off at the whole situation, but seems still willing to help with down payment). 

We have 3 different four day trips coming up (1 was a birthday present for daughter, 1 is a trip to see my son in Maryland, and 1 is a trip for just fiancee and I that we have had planned for about 6 months).

In our current situation, what do you all think the best housing situation would be for a 1 to 3, maybe even up to 6 month solution, that will have the least negative impact on ability to purchase a home when the right one comes up in our area?

21,Help with Roth IRA,"Hello! I was hoping to get some help with my Roth IRA. My Roth account was set up a few years ago by our (then) financial advisor. The account was set up through Franklin Templeton and I'm investing in [FGRAX](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/mutual-funds/products/4462/A/franklin-growth-opportunities-fund/FGRAX). At the time I didn't really understand the consequences of this, but the load and expense ratio of the fund are 5.5% and 0.91%, respectively. 

The more I learn about investing, the more I feel convinced that I should switch to investing in a low-cost, no load mutual fund, and the one that I've been considering is [SWPPX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swppx), which is Schawb's SP500 index fund. So my questions are: 1) is this a good idea?; and 2) how should I go about doing this? Should I keep my stake in FGRAX and just buy into SWPPX going forward? Should I sell my stake in FGRAX and DCA it into SWPPX? I would appreciate any advice. My current contribution to my Roth IRA is $150/month, adding more when I can. I'm also hoping to get a new job soon where I would be able to max out my contribution.

I also have a personal investment account, where I'm investing in companies that I like. This has about 2.5k in it and I'd say I contribute 200/month or so. IDK if that changes any advice you may give.

25,Buy a home or put extra money into other investments?,"Hey everyone! A little background. I’m almost 26, I make 80k base salary in a medium cost of living, midwestern city. I am single and would likely not have someone living with me in the foreseeable future. 

I have no student loans, no cc debt, a car that is paid for that should last another 5 or so years. 

I’m relatively new to workforce, so I only have about 7k in savings and just short of 5k in stock market (not including Roth IRA and 401k). My yearly pace is 8k into 401k, 8k into savings, and about 1k invested into stocks/EFTs (fortified when I have a little extra money laying around). 

Now to the good part, parents are offering to put 20% down on a house. I currently pay $1,000/month for rent, but really dislike my apartment. It’s in a fine area, but can hear everything in the apartments below, above, and next to me. Also next to no sunlight. 

I could swing an extra few hundred bucks a month for a house in the $250-300k range (~$1,100-$1,500/mo). I think it would be a big QOL increase as I could have a nice kitchen, a garden, more plants, and a home office (I wfh regardless of COVID). However, I might be able to travel less (will have been out of town 28/52 weekends in 2021). Might seem silly, but these are the things I care about most after financial stability. 

I’m most worried about being unable to afford unexpected costs that come with homeownership and therefore missing out on being able to travel while I’m young, single and can work remote. However if I continued to rent, I would have to either stay in my apartment now or spend $1,200+ monthly for a decent place. 

Do you think homeownership is right at this time? Or should I take the couple hundred bucks I save and invest it elsewhere?",personalfinance,1636572398
26,"Low income, finishing college, paid off but expensive to maintain car","Still new to personal finance and wanted to get some opinions on how to go forward. 

I’m 26 and currently a 3/4 time university student taking remote classes from my hometown (living w/ a parent) and am making ~$20,000/yr. Tuition is covered by financial aid. I have $19,000 in savings, only a few thousand in retirement accounts (457b, Roth IRA). 

I have basically taken all the remote classes I can at this point and need to move up to campus. I want to resume as a full time student, and don’t think I’ll be able to work much while doing so. I only have about three semesters left. Housing in the area is limited and rent for a single room in a house with four roommates is $600-850. Small single bedroom apartments can be occasionally found for $850, $750 if I’m willing to take on a 20+ min commute. I’m thinking the cost is worth the peace and privacy.

My vehicle is a 2005 Subaru Forester XT, fully paid off. Thing is, it gets ~18 mpg combined, needs oil changes every 3500 miles, and is close to 20 years old and thus has required ~$6000 in maintenance &amp; repairs in the last few years, with more on the way soon (struts &amp; springs - $1300 for parts alone, sunroof glass - $600 for parts, window motors).

I am wildlife student, fish biology scientific aide, and have a very outdoor centric lifestyle so an off-road capable vehicle is a necessity, despite the added cost. Thinking a Tacoma would be ideal at some point, due to capability, reliability, and minimal depreciation.

Right now, I know it’s probably best to just keep my current car until after graduating when I have more income. Admittedly I would like the peace of mind of a newer car for my 700 mile round trip from home to school, as I plan on returning home multiple times a year. 

That being said, used car prices are up and I can get ~$5000 more for my car now than I could in a regular market, and the Toyota dealership near me isn’t charging mark ups on new Tacoma’s. Used Tacomas seem to lose only a few grand in value after 100,000 miles, so buying used doesn’t make much sense to me in this case. I would be looking at a base SR model w/ 4x4 &amp; v6, no other options, comes out to ~$34000.

When it comes to paying for cost of living near campus, I really don’t know what’s best. I could just pay for everything with my savings, but it’d probably be nearly depleted by the time I’m done. Loans are an option, APR is around 3.75%. Also wondering if I should add more to retirement accounts or wait until graduating. 

I should be making $45,000/yr minimum after graduation. Just haven’t been able to achieve this amount yet due to schedule constraints that come with taking classes.

Would love to hear any thoughts or opinions if you have them. Thanks!",personalfinance,1636572392

35,Preparing for divorce. What do I need to do to make sure I come out above water?,"Hi y'all, 

I've been married just over two years and sadly it is ending. The reasons aren't important here but suffice to say there was a big life change that tainted our relationship in an irreversible way. 

What I'm trying to do is come out above water on this divorce and separation. My current credit score is ""needs work"" to ""fair"" according to Credit Karma (638-641 range). My spouse and I have a mortgage together on which we owe like $80k principal?, as well as a credit card that's currently at about $300, another at about $500, and a car. They're keeping the car, but it was bought this summer and most of the money (I think like $20k?) Is still owed. Honestly the car has been a source of contention between us because I still maintain we couldn't afford a new car plus full coverage insurance plus all the taxes as it all adds up to almost our mortgage payment. 

I believe I've been the victim of financial abuse. We never opened a joint bank account or anything, but nearly all the money I ever made went to them to ""handle the finances"" from very early on in our relationship. As a result, I have no savings whatsoever and about $4 in my bank account currently. I've heard the expression ""marriage is grand, divorce is a hundred grand"" and I'm terrified that I'm gonna come out of this saddled with uncontrollable debt. 

What steps can I take to keep my head above water financially as I navigate this?",personalfinance,1636571674
36,Starting out in my 30s and a little worried,"First time poster so feel free to shoot this down if it's dumb. I've been lurking here and on other related subs for years and have been trying to educate myself on finances, but I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. I alternate between feeling I'm doing the best I can for the future, and plain freaking out. Currently freaking out, hence this post.  I'll appreciate any insight or encouragement at this point.

I spent my 20s getting degrees and racking up credit card debt. I got my first (and current) real job with benefits at 32, paid off the cc debt at 33 and am now 35 and barely starting out both in my career and financially. I am in an industry that I love and plan on staying in, but that does not pay great. I am working slightly more than full-time and have a side-hustle, which together makes a total of about 55k pre-tax. I expect a few raises (that may or may not match inflation), a switch to a better-paying place and I can bump up my side-hustle to a few more grand per year, but none of that will dramatically change my finances - I'll be shocked if I ever get even close to 100k/yr. 

All I have in ""assets"" are 30k in my 401k, 20k in savings and 0.25 BTC. I am fairly frugal, have no debt of any kind, single without kids (and plan not to have any) and with a recent raise I have about 1.5k to save/invest per month. I am strongly considering opening a Roth IRA to complement my 401k, and opening a Fidelity account to start investing. But then all I hear about is upcoming hyperinflation, USD devaluation, the financial shock of the century coming up, everything is in a bubble kind of stuff. I can't even figure out if I should just start investing now and not overthink it as I'm in for the long haul, or if this is the worst possible time and I should sit tight and get in later when prices have dropped. I'll appreciate any insight about this.

I feel so behind compared to most people my age or on these subs. I understand that what is done is done, I can only look forward and appreciate the lessons I learned from my stupidity etc. But knowing these things intellectually doesn't stop me from feeling like I financially wasted a solid decade of my life.

37,Should I buy a house or a flat?,"Hi,

I have recently received £25,000 inheritance and think buying a home is the best way to invest it and not waste it. I can either afford a mortgage of £103,000 on my own or with my girlfriend we can borrow approximately £195,000. It's worth noting I will be a first time buyer.

I have 2 ideas which are as follows:

1. Buy a flat for £100,000, live in it for around 5 years whilst saving for a deposit on a house. When I have saved approx. £15-20k use this for a deposit on a house then rent out the flat and switch to a letting mortgage with this property. I will be honest and say I have no idea how hard it would be to get a second mortgage.
2. Just buy a house for around £195k and use some savings when possible to get jobs done on the house e.g. new kitchen to add value + save some money on the side to add to another deposit when time comes to sell said house.

Please feel free to demolish my ideas, I've never really been very academic/financially aware but want to do something which will benefit me long term with this money.

I’ve been contributing $600 every paycheck to my Roth with the goal of reaching the $6k limit in December, with roughly $400 paycheck going into a taxable brokerage account which I plan to use for long term goals such as house, car, family, retirement, etc. and the remainder into a HYSA for shorter term goals/stashing for 401k contributions next year. Emergency fund is taken care of btw.

39,"Car issues, dealerships to pay X amount for repairs..but do I lease instead?","Hi All,

I have a friend who's car is having major engine issues. Long story short the repairs are $10k in value. GM has offered to pay 30%. Friend is arguing to get 100% as it was technically a recall but they are saying the issues were ignored resulting in this.

they are talking to a dealership and they said the trade in value is $11k as-is for the current car that has $6500 remaining left on the loan. I think the guy at the dealership is going to help her get more money by doing some things. I don't want to discuss him hiding the issues to get her more money for the trade in, but I want to note that in case the numbers don't make sense for the trade value.

They said they could get them into a 2022 lease for $159 a month and current payments on the loan are about $250 a month.

Im thinking if GM doesn't cover any more of the cost then it probably makes the most sense to trade in for the \~$11k, pay off the original loan, then use remaining $ to put on the lease downpayment and hop into the lease for $150 a month.

I received several offers but one company offered me a 20 year mortgage at 2.625%. I applied, lock in the rate and had an appraisal done, cost was $1200. The day I received the appraisal back the loan officer informed me that the bank they wanted to get my loan thru didn’t do mortgages on 40 acre parcels only up to 20 acre parcels.

I don’t have that much money saved. 

1.Say if I do exercise and hold part of the stocks (and pay taxes on them today). What  if I decide to sell these stocks sometime later next year and the stock price is lower that what it is now. How will I be taxed then during the sale ?

2. If I use the sell to cover option. I’m getting  around half the stock options. How would taxation work of I decide to sell these stocks ?

* I left the US permanently in April.
* I received a letter at my old address asking for additional identification verification via my US phone number that I no longer had.
* I tried contacting the IRS every couple of days from April until late July, but the call was always rejected (we are receiving too many calls, try again later).
* In late July, I sent a request to Taxpayer Advocate via snail mail.
* In September, TPA cold called me late at night and I missed the call (7 hour time difference).
* TPA sent a letter to my old US address (gee, thanks).
* I was able to contact the IRS in late September finally and verify my identity (yay!).
* I was informed on the same call that I might be under audit, and the decision to audit would be made by October 25.
* I called back on October 27 and was told that I can't find out if I'm under audit because my case is being handled by TPA, so they can't talk to me directly any further.
* I have called TPA several times since then and left messages asking for a phone call and not a letter, but I have received no contact.

I need to figure out what job I can get to support my family, and help my wife with her work situation.","This whole thing feels like a giant knot and I'm not sure where to start. This whole year has been incredibly and increasingly difficult financially and it is affecting my family's physical health and putting a great deal of stress on our marriage. What I'm looking for is advice on how to solve a few major issues and hopefully that will give me breathing room to work on further improvements. For further context, we have a 1-yr old that we take care of while both of us work from home.

Me:  
Without giving all the details, I've no degree, over $20,000 in student loan debts, and a weak resume to get hired in my desired field (programming) in a full-time WFH position. I am currently employed WFH part time and manage to make about $9,000 a year, but this income is inconsistent.  


My wife:

* Currently working a full time position making \~$45,000 a year. WFH.
* Started off great years ago, but position exploded into doing essentially 4 different jobs with no significant pay adjustment. Very overworked and underpaid and on top of that has to be a mother. It is damaging her health mentally and physically.
* Really wants to quit her job but we don't know how to manage it. Worried about lapse in income, in healthcare, and having to work in general.

Between rent, groceries, emergent issues (had to replace an appliance, pet needed surgery, etc.), we are beyond living paycheck-to-paycheck and have had to dip into our savings to the point that they are now nearly nonexistent. I has to change by then end of this year because student loan payments will be coming back. We live far away from family (to achieve an affordable rent) and somewhat need WFH jobs to maintain this living arrangement. This makes childcare our responsibility so one of us has to be at most employed part time and ideally just unemployed to be able to raise our child.

  
The questions:

**How do I take over as the ""breadwinner"" for the household?**

This has been a big problem for most of my adult life. I don't know how to get started on my career path and despite having employable skills have an expanding gap of no relevant work experience that I feel is just digging me a deeper and deeper pit over the years. I have skills as a programmer (primarily C#) but I don't know how to translate this into a position. What I'm really looking for is a type of job to aim for. I've looked at C# developer positions but it seems to involve aspects web development which I have no experience in. I've looked at game development and related fields (lot of interesting VR/AR projects) but have no portfolio or experience in XR. What is a good first job, ideally WFH?

   
**How do we improve our healthcare situation?** 

I pay about $400 monthly for a personal plan. Her current job takes *over $400 a paycheck* for a total of something like $850 a month. This covers her and our child but I don't understand how this is considered ""affordable"" (in the context of ACA) and what our options are. With it being open enrollment now, wouldn't it be better for her to switch to a plan outside of her employer? I don't really understand how all of this works and could use some guidance.

I am willing to offer more information as needed to arrive at a solution. Please let me know any input as I am desperate for change. Thank you.",personalfinance,1636566500

I have the choice between 3 High Deductible Health Plans through my employer. The details are below. 

Plan 1:
Family deductible: $3200
Family max out of pocket: $6850
Monthly premium: $386

Plan 2:
Family deductible: $5100
Family max out of pocket: $10,900
Monthly premium: $250

Plan 3:
Family deductible: $6850
Family max out of pocket: $13,100
Monthly premium: $177

When the baby is born, adding them to the plan will increase the premium (not exactly sure how much it will be, but one of my coworkers says plan 1 costs them like $600/mo this past year when  they enrolled themself, their wife, and their kid). 

So my question is, which plan should I go with? 

My next question is, if the more expensive plan 1 (the lowest deductible) is the best one to go with, should I choose to enroll in that plan right now during annual enrollment, or should I pick the lower premium plan and then when the baby is born in may, use that qualifying life event to then switch to the expensive plan with the higher deductible?",personalfinance,1636565210

I will only be making around $6,000 this year with 1099 Contractor income. (I will have other income from investments.)

Is this true:

* Contributing to a Solo 401K or having business office expenses both equally reduce AGI
* Business expenses are slightly more valuable because it reduces the income for SE Tax calculation purposes.
* But then how do these two options impact QBI deduction? Would contributing to Solo 401k be better in this case because the Income is higher so the deduction is higher?

I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, assuming it's not a financial burden on me to do so, is it better to use my $6,000 by looking at the Solo 401k first (probably $5500??), or is it better to apply all my business expenses first (will just be a couple hundred dollars, but hypothetically, what if it was more?), and then using up the rest of my ""profit"" in contributions to the solo 401k?

(Also, I don't know the difference between the words estate and trust so I use them interchangeably, sorry for any confusion.)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my grandmother passed away 10 years ago and left the 7 grandchildren her estate, which is sort of a large sum of money, BUT it was under the stipulation that my Uncle D had to be financially taken care of for the remainder of his life, before the estate was released to the grandchildren. He passed away this past weekend. My Uncle D lived off of the monthly interest of the trust for the past 10 years. A house was also bought for my Uncle D through the estate and pretty much everything he has is was purchased by the estate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the estate is going to be ""released"" to me and my cousins. However, it is set up so that each of our parents (the children of my grandmother) become the executors of our trusts, for their respective kids. It's estimated each kid will inherit about 200k, plus whatever the house nets when its sold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what it means for my mom to be the executor of my trust. I asked her if we're going to be given this money in a lump sum and she said that my grandmothers estate only allows for X amount to be given each year (sounds reasonable especially with a 21 year old cousin). My mom also said something about needing to take a minimum X amount out of the trust each year, required by law, so the government can collect taxes. The government makes me take money out of my trust??

&amp;#x200B;

My questions: Where does this $200k go? Is it invested? Is it my moms decision on where? I'm financially doing well, no debt except for a mortgage on a house I just bought, so I don't exactly ""need"" this money now or to survive by any means. I have no idea what to do with whatever amount of money I'll get each year. Do I invest? How much should I have in a savings account? (I currently have about $15k in a savings account and about $20k invested, some in an IRA, some in mutual funds). Should I get my own financial advisor? It's sort of like I'm going to be juggling money in two places, the trust and the money released to me annually.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are financially set, and I know that they have only my best interest at heart. But I want to be more educated when we come to the table to discuss the financial planning and process going forward. My goals are to make this money last, make as much money as I can off of it, while perhaps spending a couple thousand on a new stove, or updates to my house over time.

Could I pay for a home appraisal, and if my current loan principal balance became at most 80% of the apprasial amount, could I ask my lender to remove my PMI? The appraisal value would need to be between $138K-$139K which is a 9 point something increase.

5,"I don't Java, should I take the job?","I am a 22 y/o student, last year on my Data Science Bachelor Degree, who needs advice from anyone at the moment, as I feel like this might be some kind of turning point in my life/young adult life. Please hear me out. Some of the stuff I wrote might sound dumb, but please hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no experience or knowledge with programming before I started at Uni. I got introduced to Python. It was difficult at the begginning but within a year, I fell in love with it. The summer before my second year started, I got interrested in Javascript, mainly because of React js. I made some projects both small and large using React js only (FE). From there on, even tho my degree is going to be in Data Science, I only worked on software projects, both FE(React js) and BE (Express, Typescript / Node js). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, now that I briefly explained what I like, its time to bring up the actual ""problem"". As I mentioned, Data Science Bachelor is the degree I am getting next year. But Software is what I like. I had planned to work within software before I work in Data Science. That hasnt changed.

&amp;#x200B;

I meet a full stack developer through a friend, and we connected fast. We also worked with a project together for half a year, where he was the BE guy and me in FE. So he knows that React js or Javascript generally is what I like working with. Anyways, I told him that it was maybe time for me to start searching for job as software developer. So he (as my friend and a mentor) recomended me to the company (international company) he works for. He spent quite a time trying to get me the job, as there were quite a bit of paper work he had to do. A week ago, he called me and told me that they were interrrested and that he could get me an interview for the job as Junior Full Stack Developer. He also mentioned that their department (in this country) does not usually work with FE, but mosly backend, which is in Java. Even tho Java sounded scary, I was optimistic. For the past 5-7 days, I have been trying to understand Java Spring. I must say, that I hate it! It really does not make any sense compared to building a backend using Node js, Typescript, Express. Java Spring is total chaos, and I have been very unmotivated/stressed/scared of taking the job. Even tho he told me that they do not expect much from Junior delevoper, I still can not stop thinking about wether this is a right decision or not. I am the type of guy who is not afraid of most of the things, BUT, I am afraid of saying NO, especially to those who are nice/have given me opportunities. I just cant say NO. I am scared that I never will like the language Java, and therefore hate the job, and generally unmotivated to work within programming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this might be a good opportunity for me, and some part of me is saying that I just need to dive in and see what happens. Worst case scenario is that I have to quit that job and search for another. But I am also afraid that my mentor will think that I wasted lot of his time and effort to get me in there. This is my first tech job so I have no idea what I am getting myself into either.

Do I talk to my job about my mental state?,"Hey all, before I get any thing saying I should be posting this somewhere different, I'd like to preface this by saying I already have started seeking therapist and mental health help. This is solely me asking about what would be the best way to approach this situation from a career-wise perspective, hence why I'm here asking about my particular situation.

--------

- So I'm a brand new developer straight out of college with a Computer Engineering degree, in a fairly large company that started late July 2021.

- My team is based entirely out of India, except me. 
- I have never done any web development in my life, but wanted to try it, so I asked for that kind of work in my team-selection process and this is where they put me. I understand I asked for this, but I feel that've put a lot of responsibility on me. 

- They basically have tasked me with basically becoming the main developer for a web-application that two interns wrote this past summer.

- Throughout all this, I've made big life changes, having moved into the city on my own, dealing with ADHD, relationship issues, and having dealt with depression for almost a year. 

- **I have finally reached a point this week where I have literally done almost no work and I feel that my depression is to the point where it hinders my ability to get out of bed, work, and gather the motivation to start on a task.**

- It doesn't help that since my team is entirely based out of India, it is very hard to communicate with them on my own time, it makes me look bad as a new developer because I take much longer to complete my tasks. I work remote 3/5 days of the week with nobody to talk to on my team even when I am on site. Then the ADHD doesn't help the very few days I finally have the motivation to work on something, but the concentration isn't there. And the rest of the days, I'm too depressed to get out of bed to even get on my standup call.

- I really don't want to tell my work about my mental state, but I feel that if I don't communicate to my work somehow, I'll look really bad and that I'm a lazy developer when I don't mean to be at all... I just want to know what might be some good things from a career standpoint to do from this point out to finally get back on my feet again.",cscareerquestions,1636747794

for the past 4 years I've been working in different roles which were all very much related to data (BI developer, data governance, analytical product owner). It's fine, but it's not something I really enjoy doing or that I'm particularly passionate about.

Things to consider:   
a) I'm also someone who'd like to be ""in demand"" for the next few years at least.   
b) I've put a lot effort and time into my data-related skills and career, and I feel like my experience could land me some pretty cool jobs in this area, so I feel like I would ""throw all of this away"" when switching to let's say product management (a job you could also do with e.g. a business background).

# Context

I'm a senior at an Ivy League school, majoring in CS. I did FBU (Facebook University, first/second year internship program at FB) the summer after my freshman year, and returned to FB the next two summers working in Java and then C++. I have pretty strong TAing experience in some more technical systems level classes, as well as some club leadership experience.

## Stats

Applied: 24

Online Assessment: 10

Explicitly Rejected: 5

Ghosted: 13

Offers: 6

# Applying

I had a standard return offer in hand from Facebook after my internship, but was disappointed by a lower TC than last year's offers and generally curious about other potential offers, so I applied pretty selectively to a combination of FAANG companies, top HFT firms, and unicorns. I also lucked into a referral from an AirBnB host which led to a verbal offer at a small secretive company, which I can't share details about.

Thinking back on my process, there are a couple of things that worked out well by luck and some that I would have changed. 

- Organization: I'd recommend a better system than I had for keeping organized. Even with a relatively small number of applications, I quickly lost track of which companies I'd already applied to and which ones had pending steps. I tried using huntr (basically a kanban board for jobs), but didn't update it frequently enough.

- Email: I used my school email for applications, but going back I'd have set things up with my personal non-spam email. I think there are probably benefits to this for recognizable names, but the downside was that important emails sometimes got lost in list serv spam from student groups. This may be coupled to the fact that I've basically given up on inbox zero, so this may or may not be generally applicable. 

- Scheduling/Timing: My school had a minimum offer deadline, which was what was on my return offer. I was applying pretty sporadically over late August to October, so I really lucked out in having five offers which were all simultaneously active.

- Adventitious offers: I got a totally viable potential offer from a random stranger, without going through any standard recruiting channels. It's not reproducible, but jobs can come from lots of potential avenues.

I want to shout out Google, Jane Street, Robinhood, Databricks, and Roblox for actually rejecting me by email instead of ghosting me like a dozen other companies. No idea why recruiting teams can't have some macro or program to sync their rejection lists with a template email.


# Online Assessments

I saw a pretty big range of different assessments. I think that the ones that I enjoyed the most were Stripe's and Optiver's which asked more real-world type questions with a complex setup but average algorithms.

I'm pretty firmly in the camp of hating CodeSignal as a platform. I dislike tying together applications to different companies on an arbitrary two-week boundary, and the sheer luck involved in drawing questions should really make companies question it's use in terms of false result generation. As an example, I got a 725/850 on one test for two companies with 1/2/1 (Easy/Medium/Hard), and on a practice test a few weeks later (which are supposedly equivalent), I got a score of 844/850 with 2/2/0. They also count time taken in an absurd proportion, making it better to skip hards if you get them. I have no suggestions here, just ranting.

I tried to avoid too much Leetcode grind, with varying success. Since my freshman year of college, I've done 260 problems (99E/154M/7H), but probably only about a third to half of that was for new grad specifically. I didn't follow Blind 75 or pay for Premium, though I did focus on one type of problem at a time. For problems with chains, it's definitely worth going through them sequentially if time allows. I think this is pretty common advice, but trying to memorize specific algorithms or problems is mostly a waste of time. It's better to focus on common patterns and types of questions (i.e. two pointers, backtracking, etc). I focused a lot on DP, but ended up not passing any of the OAs that asked DP questions, so ¯\\\_ (ツ)\_/¯. I also switched from Java to Python, but I recommend keeping familiar with two of Java/Python/C++, since some places want Java or C++ specifically (especially HFT). Python allows for faster code velocity/iteration in my experience, and is pretty expressive with a rich standard library, so it's good in coding interview situations. 

# Interviews

I think that the part that most trips me up in the interviews is talking through my process. I practiced this a few times in mock interviews, and also on my own, which I found to be helpful. Finding the right balance between letting your interviewer know what you're doing and actually knowing yourself what to do is tricky, but it's important to have buy-in from the interviewer. My worst interviews were when my interviewer wasn't following what I was coding. Also, even coding focused interviews mostly included some behavioral component. Having a pretty technical and in-depth project to talk about is super helpful for those, as is having real world engineering experience (collaborating with different groups, XFN peers, etc). If you don't have a good internship project to talk about, I'd try to make sure you have a decent group project from school or from a club.

I had phone screens and/or onsites with five different companies. In roughly chronological order:

## Microsoft

Timeline: Applied 8/31, invited to phone screen on 9/21, did phone screen 9/30, heard back the next day that I passed, scheduled an onsite for 10/15, and got an offer on 10/20.

The phone screen was pretty easy, a mix of OOP fundamentals and designing a stack with smallest item query. The onsite day was pretty long, with four 45-minute interviews, but there was nothing harder than a Medium. 

## Citadel

Timeline: Applied and received OA 8/31, submitted OA 9/3, heard back 9/7, phone screen 9/27, heard back 10/13, onsite 10/27, final round leadership call 11/2, offer 11/5. 

My phone screen was originally scheduled for 9/24, and I got as far as logging into the zoom room five minutes early, when they let me know that my interviewer was out of the office, so it got rescheduled for 9/27. Even though I bumbled through copy list with random pointer, I made it past the phone screen. The onsite was three 45-minute interviews, each asking wildly varying questions. Some had a mini behavioral section, most had a medium-ish coding question, or easy with follow-ups focused on code quality/modifiability, and I think one had tiny URL system design. After this step they also asked for a top five achievements list, which was a bit weird, but is apparently part of the CEO review process. My interviewer for the manager chat also missed the meeting, and I had to reschedule for later that day.

## Optiver

Timeline: Applied 9/20, got OA 9/22, submitted 9/24, heard back 10/1 and schedule recruiter screen 10/6, heard back from that 10/11 and scheduled a HackerRank review for 10/13, heard back from that 10/15, scheduled onsite 10/29, and got an offer 11/1.

The HackerRank had a long-time window (72 hours) and I took a couple hours on it to nicely comment and clean up my code. The engineering phone screen involved going over and fixing edge cases for the OA, so I definitely didn't get them all haha. The onsite was just two hour-long interviews, which in my case were mostly system design with a financial/trading bent. I think in general it's supposed to be one coding, one design, but my coding interviewer had me write pseudocode only and mostly discuss the system design. I think my systems classes/TAing actually helped a lot here, as I was able to talk pretty intelligibly about page sizes and caching decisions, as well as concurrency issues.

## Stripe

Timeline: Applied 10/2, received OA 10/5, completed 10/6, heard back 10/7. Had a phone screen on 10/13, heard back 10/14, scheduled onsite for 10/25, and got my offer on 10/28.

I signed an NDA for the onsite, so won't discuss specifics, but the process is really quite engineering friendly. Very few Leetcode style algorithm questions, and mostly focused on clean code and maintainability. Definitely my most enjoyable interview process all around, and a really quick recruiting process with short turnarounds. I attended a recruiting event the day before applying, and an interview prep workshop after the OA, so could be related to that.

# Offer Details

The part Blind is probably clamoring for: compensation details and offer breakdowns. I'm a very spreadsheet friendly person, so I probably had a slight bias towards quantifiable metrics like TC, but it was definitely not my only metric. Especially as a new grad, I think the most important factor is going to be learning opportunity, and how quickly that can be translated into more responsibility. In this metric, I think that Stripe and Facebook are equal and ahead of Microsoft. I'm not sure where to slot in the HFT firms. I've heard Citadel is much more competitive than collaborative, and I think the work would probably be less morally rewarding (though probably more financially rewarding). I'm also not really sure what the career progression will be like there. Apparently a relatively normal timeline is 2-3 years between promotions at Optiver, and their US CTO started out as a new grad only a decade ago, so I think it's pretty comparable to big tech in that regard.

A couple of notes on how I've calculated TC: for RSUs I've taken the three-year average annual return on the stock, and plugged that in to the salary calculator on levels.fyi, and also included the TC assuming no growth for comparison. To be clear, I don't necessarily expect these companies to continue growing at these rates, but it feels like a reasonable base for comparison at least. I'm ignoring refreshers, but they could potentially add \~10-30k on average to the amortized TC.

## Facebook/Meta (Seattle)
I got a standard returning intern offer, which they are not negotiating this year. 118k base, 10% bonus, 160k RSUs/4 years, and a 50k signing bonus plus 10k relocation. Amortized over 4 years with a 30% annual stock growth, this comes out to a TC of 215k, or 185k without any growth.

## Microsoft (Seattle)
Not negotiated at all, but there's probably room to improve the sign on at least, if not more. This is for L59. 115k base, 10% bonus, 120k RSUs/4 years (I think, possibly 3.5), and a 20k signing bonus and 5k relocation. Average TC of 220k with 45% annual stock growth, or 160k without any growth.

## Citadel Securities (Chicago)
My offer was for the securities side, which is apparently better (though not good) in terms in WLB. I'd be expecting 60-80 hour weeks, which isn't particularly attractive. 175k base, 100k guaranteed bonus first year, 100k signing bonus, 10k relocation. TC 300k amortized assuming no variation in the bonus (which is not likely).

## Optiver (Chicago)
The WLB seems likely better at Optiver than CitSec. The bonus is tied to your marble level (50, 100, 200, etc), and each marble is worth \~2k (last year was 6k but unlikely to repeat). 150k base, 80k first year bonus (then transitions to marbles), and 50k signing bonus with 5k relocation. Average TC \~250k, again ignoring bonus variability.

## Stripe (SF) [Accepted]
I tried negotiating, but couldn't get them to budge even with the higher CitSec offer. I've heard some mixed things about the RSU policy, but I think it could be a plus for rapid progression in TC as I would immediately get the next level grant after a promo. The policy makes the TC relatively insensitive to stock growth outside the first IPO year, since there's only one year of upside. There's also a new performance grant/refresher system that I'm not accounting for in TC calculations. 135k base, 10% bonus, 80k yearly RSU, and a 70k signing bonus split 50/20, with 10k for relocation. Over 4 years, average TC is 265k with a yearly 20% growth (i.e. RSU grant is worth 95k per year), or 250k assuming no growth.

I think that for me, Stripe offered a broader set of potential technical problems than trading, and probably with better WLB. I've heard some bad things about Stripe WLB, but I think it's pretty comparable to FB, and definitely better than in trading. Also, in the medium-term I think I'd prefer to be on the West coast rather than Chicago/NY, but YMMV.

59,"New grad, first job. Send help!","As a new grad, I looked for bigger, established companies that favored in-office work rather than remote after reading so many comments in this sub. I really wanted to have direct access to mentors and come into an established situation. A few months ago I got an offer for a job which I thought met this criteria but it turned out to be radically different. I mentioned some of my concerns to my coworkers but they are making me feel like I am the crazy person. I'll do my best to explain some of the goings on and hopefully I can get some feedback on this situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

This company provides software that helps in creation of certain industrial products. I don't want to get any more specific than that, but our software is pretty unique and apparently improves the profit margin for these producers significantly. Their processes at the plants are now reliant on our software.  

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't understand this until I started, but the team I was placed into was a small startup that had been acquired very recently, in a very distant city. By the time I started, only one of the team members was working in my local office. I am constantly being told that everyone else is apparently ""planning to move"" but it already has been months and I don't think they are really ever coming. My immediate team leader is included in this - I have met him only one time in the few months that I've worked here.  

&amp;#x200B;

But that was a thing in and of itself. When I started, I could not figure out who to report to. The manager I interviewed with told me it was ""Steve"", but ""Steve"" would not return any of my messages on teams. I would contact some of the other project leads for tasks (remember: most of them in distant far away city) and likewise would often get simply ignored. I sat with the one local coworker but he told me that I wasn't on his team either, and so he didn't have anything for me to do.  

&amp;#x200B;

 There was zero onboarding or training and I got no instruction for how to set up my environments. We are connecting directly to our customer's systems so its not something as simple as downloading whatever software. No one wanted to give me any of the connection info, what VPNs needed to be used or how to set them up, who to contact for the logins to the customer's systems, etc. Not that any of it mattered because apparently nobody had any tasks anyway.  

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually (after 2 months or so) I got access and started getting tasks. They ranged from small UI fixes, writing some code, and up to modifying tables in databases. These were all production systems because we have no test environment. When someone on the team makes a mistake that breaks the software, it results in massive loss of profits at the plants. I've been told it is six or seven figures per day for the plants. Since I have been here, I have seen our team's mistakes costs the plants 2-3 weeks of down time (across all our customers). In other words there are significant consequences for messing up. And its pretty easy to mess up. But there is no way to test any of the changes.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was super nervous when I was thrown into the live systems for this reason. The tasks started simple but quickly ballooned into very big things. I constantly asked to be supervised, double checked, reviewed, anything. But no one wanted to do that because they were too busy.  

&amp;#x200B;

I made a few mistakes myself which eventually caused big errors in the database. The problems didn't even show up for a few days after I made the change so its not like I could've caught it in the moment. My coworkers yelled at me, and said things such as ""didn't you get trained on this?"" and essentially saying that it was my fault that I didn't know. I know for a fact that I asked this person specifically to look over this change but I couldn't get any help.  

&amp;#x200B;

The customers don't seem happy at all with the support they've been receiving, and I've heard a lot of comments from them to the tune of ""we could email \[this team\], but they're not going to help us"". Some of the customers told me that they went months without receiving any support that they had paid for and they were looking for other options in the future. When I ask my coworkers, they just tell me that the customers will complain no matter what and it doesn't really matter what they do.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first job and I know basically nothing. Am I crazy thinking that it shouldn't be this way? I don't know if I should look elsewhere immediately or try to stick it out a year or two.

60,Current equity not vested - can I apply for new jobs now and ask them to wait? or cover the difference?,"I've been in tech for about 15 years and have a lot of good experience. As a consultant, I've been exposed to a ton of different stuff, but I'm not learning as much anymore and am thinking about changing jobs. But... that's basically all in one job, so I don't have a lot of practice with the whole job search thing.

Currently, I have a bunch of equity at my current employer. It vests in next August (little less than a year.) The difference between vested and unvested value when I leave would be \~$160,000.

But I found a listing for a principal engineer job I really want to apply for at a company where the total comp would be a big improvement. But probably not big enough to make it worth walking away from my current equity just before it vests.

So my questions are:

* How early is too early to apply? I've heard about new grads getting offers the year before they graduate, so... would applying now for Q3 next year look bad?
* Alternately, if they want me before I vest, how bad does it look to ask them to cover some of the difference? Are signing bonuses a thing right now in this industry?
* Or if I apply now, while that job is still open, does it look bad for a future application?

62,"Resigned from toxic startup job a few months ago, offered consultation services when they hired a replacement, but no longer want to associate with this company under any circumstances. Should I reply to ex-boss messages or continue to ignore him?","I worked at a small startup as a React Native developer for about 5 months. One non-tech and another semi-tech co-founder (both US based), a Unity and Back-end Developer (India based).

It was my first job as a software dev. Don't want to go into a whole lot of detail about the experience, but some notable points:

- I was easily working 80-100 hours a week
- Boss (COO) was extremely overbearing, little to no boundaries
- Verbally abusive
- Absolute, unending, persistent criticism over every aspect of my work output, personality and professionalism
- Ex-boss (COO) extremely disagreeable
- No mentorship, no senior level engineers to assist when stuck

I couldn't handle the stress. To keep up with the roadmaps I had to work anywhere between 10-13 hours a day, and anywhere from 8-10 hours on the weekend. 

Chalk it up to my inexperience, aggressive demands and pace of development from CEO. Both. I don't care. 

There were no boundaries with my ex-boss. He'd message me at 8pm. Interrupt me constantly throughout the day while I was working with issues he wanted answers to immediately. 

Two instances of verbal abuse I can recall. I was implementing in-app purchases for the application. Never implemented this before, was struggling. Ex-boss offered to be  a kind of rubber ducky to help me figure it out. I accepted reluctantly. At some point about a half-hour in we both come across an FAQ section of the documentation that appeared to resolve the issue I was running into. He then proceeds to berate me over a Zoom call, raise his voice in anger and ask me ""Why wasn't this the first thing you tried to do. We just wasted a whole day, when you could have tried this first.""

The fact of the matter was that I saw that FAQ, and it didn't solve the problem in the slightest, but I couldn't explain that to him in a way that he would understand because he's not a developer. He gets system designs and integration, but has no software level experience in anything except for SQL.

Another instance, I tried explaining to him that a feature he wanted developed would take me longer than expected. Tried explaining it to him, struggled because it's just very difficult to explain things to someone whose never written a line of code in his life. Wouldn't let me off the phone until I gave him an explanation he could understand. Ended the call with him angrily exclaiming ""I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S SOO HARD TO..."".

I called him out on his tone. I asked him, ""Do you understand how you berating me does nothing except destroy my self-esteem, and do nothing to help me resolve this problem faster?"" His response: ""I don't know what you want me to tell you. This is a startup, you have to be able to handle the pressure.""

I wasn't a co-founder in the company. I was an employee. Sure, there's a lot of pressure for employees to keep up with the CEO's demands. But as another redditor once put it ""Co-founder stress belongs to the co-founders, and shouldn't be passed down to employees"". It leads to toxicity in the workplace and employees leaving the company.

I sat one literally dozens of meetings where I'd be on a call with the India-based PM for our backend developer, where the entire meeting the ex-boss would be chewing him out. Raising his voice in anger. 

Nothing was ever the bosses fault. Nothing was ever the problem of a complete lack of qualified technical leadership and project management.

I was in the most amount of physically and emotional distress I had ever had in any job I've ever held. On the verge of burnout, palpable, heightened anxiety and stress that lasted for weeks on end.

The perpetual criticism, often petty, complete lack of positive feedback, ex-boss setting up his work-station right next to mine in the last few weeks before I resigned.... unbearable.

----------------------------

The fact of the matter is that both my ex-boss and I made a mistake with my employment. I knew the pressure would be high, I thought I could handle it, I couldn't. They hired a junior dev with no work experience to perform at the level of a senior dev. We both fucked up. 

So I resigned, put my two-weeks notice in, offered to consult at the time that they hired a new employee. But, a few months later... I'm sorry - for whatever my faults were as an employee, I know I wasn't perfect... but that job was a toxic hellhole, and my ex-boss is a shitty, shitty manager with total disregard for how he treats people working for him.

-----------------------------

When I resigned, my ex-boss suddenly turned into the nicest guy. Offered mentorship in finding my next job, to review my resume, suddenly started complimenting me on all my accomplishments, told me these would look great on my resume. 

The most bizarre change in personality that I can now only chalk up to them wanting to retain me as a consultant. I agreed to consult, but I was so completely mind-fucked by that point.

Anyways, the point of this post. He's been messaging me. Not ""Hi Dave, we hired a new dev. Would you have some time to discuss bringing you on as a consultant?""

Just ""Hey Dave!"". In my head I'm thinking... ""Hey WHAT?"". Don't respond. A few weeks later, ""Hey Dave!""... again, in my head ""HEY FUCKING WHAT?""

Emails me yesterday: ""Dave, hope all is well. I tried sending a couple of messages, not sure if they're going through, so I thought I would send you an email. Look forward to hearing back from you!"".

ABOUT FUCKING WHAT.

I don't want to engage with this guy, because I don't trust him. He's a manipulative asshole. ""Hey Dave!"" is a way to rope me into a fake, ""friendly"" conversation instead of just laying your cards on the table. Just tell me why you're messaging me. If it's for consultation, then I understand what we'll be talking about, and I can come in prepared to weigh the pros and cons of working with him again. 

I'm not this guys friend. I'm an ex-employee, and if he needs something from me, he can ask. I'm not responding to ""Hey Dave!"". 

Anyways... sorry for this long post.. it's like.. impossible for me to get to the point because all this ever does is bring up trauma... but I guess the question is.. should I continue ghosting this guy? I just can't bear to speak a word to him unless I know exactly what he wants to talk to me about. I don't trust him at all.",cscareerquestions,1636735751
63,How to deal with constant rejections mentally?,"Hi everyone,

I am backend developer with 3 years experience. For more background about me and my current career you can check my cv in here. https://www.overleaf.com/read/bmncztwmszpp

Cause I have some personal reasons. Currently applying some relocate available Python backend jobs from mostly LinkedIn. Also explaining why I am thinking to leave this company. 

Today, I got an interview from some Netherlands company. Made a phone call with them. It was quite good for me and the stages after call were like this. 3 question task &gt; tech call &gt; assignment &gt; another meeting &gt; hire. But I got rejected after phone call. 

There were times that I failed at technical assignments or tech interviews and I could understand that I need to improve but getting rejected after phone call with recruiter was a first and quite disappointing. I thought at least I would get 3 question task but even that didn’t happen. They said I wasn’t fit for position and nothing more. 

So I feel despair and losing my self esteem. How do I deal with getting rejected and the feeling of not being good enough?",cscareerquestions,1636735536

66,"1st year BSc Comp Sci, not enough maths content. Interested in modelling. Which route would you take?"," I did an access course (science) to gain entry onto year 1 of a Comp Sci BSc at a decent polytech Uni (due to no maths a-level). The course is challenging &amp; I am enjoying it, but they have reduced the level of maths content from previous years. 

Ideally, I'd like to pursue something analytical, as modelling systems &amp; such interests me much more than web development, for eg. I plan on finishing the year at least, but I am beginning to worry that staying at this university will be a mistake. 

I believe it will be too late for me to try &amp; study for maths a-level at this time, though I am considering to begin studying for it if I can get ahead with the course. My two options then, appear to be to reapply to a different university for next year, which has more emphasis on maths content but may be lenient enough to take me on at year 1 given the circumstance, or otherwise continue at this university in hopes of gaining entry onto a data analytics MSc of some sort. 

I'm led to believe university prestige is important in finance roles &amp; believe a role such as quantitative development would interest me. If anyone had an advice or anecdotal information that could give me some direction I'd be eternally grateful.

68,Could I have an assessment / reality-check?,"Hi, I read through the FAQs etc on the sidebar, and I'm wondering if someone here can help me figure out if I have marketable skills/how to present them, or if I'm moving in the right direction?

I have a [Github profile](https://github.com/SpectralVectors) that hosts my work: mostly free/open addons (plug-ins) for Blender (3D Modelling program), written in Python.

I've used libraries like os, re, ctypes, math, urllib.request, contextlib, mediapipe, opencv-python to accomplish tasks like: translating node graphs, rerouting to stdout and printing to a .py file, downloading and installing addons remotely from Github, and other workflow tools within Blender.

Outside of Blender/Python: I've built and maintained Wordpress and Github pages sites, I've got a bit of experience with Linux/bash, js, though not a ton.

In trying to make my porfolio a little less niche I'm working on a Flask site with a MySQL database that gets populated through Scrapy spiders / API calls.

Previous experience/jobs include (more than this, but these are the most applicable):

* Broadcast TV post sound editor
* Podcast Producer (includes edit, upload, distribution etc)
* IT/Tech Support
* Music Teacher
* a degree and a diploma, neither are in CS, I did take a CS-101 course in college, fwiw

I love free/open source software, and my intention was to have a 'regular' job and continue with development in my time off, however, my current job is not giving me enough to get by, and I'm wondering if the things on my Github page are too niche to help in a job search?

I've merged pull requests into my repos, but I've never submitted one.

Some people have starred and forked some of my stuff.

I've worked almost exclusively inside Blender, but only via the Python API.

The OpenCV/Mediapipe addon is one that I forked and modified from someone else, does this affect whether it should be included in my projects?

When I'm reading job postings I feel hilariously under-qualified for anything, and when looking at some of the in-demand skills/languages/libraries, I'm not sure what I should focus on to build my skillset.

I guess I'm hoping someone can tell me what, if anything, my experience is worth?

And, are the broad strokes (I've used libraries X, Y, Z to accomplish...) a good way to present info about how your code works? (Sorry if I missed this in the resume thread).

77,Recruiter told me she was “sticking my neck out for me” so I “better sign an offer letter”,"Over the past couple weeks I’ve been I’ve been interviewing with a company that approached me about a job I was pretty interested. From the outside they seemed pretty good and for a while it was looking like they’d probably be my future employer (I’ll call them company A).

Then I started seeing red flags.

I got called by the recruiter from the company telling me I’d be getting in on-site interview. After that, she started asking me about the other companies I was interviewing at, why I was talking to them, and why I wanted to work at their company. Then she started asking “what would make the difference in your choice??” and I told her a competitive compensation package would be very persuasive.

She then begins pushing hard for a number or range. I declined and told her I’d like to wait until I get an offer (if I got one) to start salary negotiations. She says ok and then tells me to tell her about how my on site interview with another company (which I had tomorrow) went after I had it.

Turns out she needs me to agree on a number because the way in which offers are given at this company is that while you’re on site after the final interview, if you pass, they walk you into a room with the ceo, hand you the offer letter, and expect you to sign right then. And they won’t have me on site if they can’t get me to agree to a number. I thought that was weird but “eh maybe this is just their process.”

The next day I have my on-site with this second company (let’s call them company B). It goes very well, and I send this recruiter an email letting her know that.

“Can I call you now?” she says in an immediate reply email. 

So I’m in an airport on the phone with this recruiter, who’s extolling the virtues of her company and REALLY pushing me for a number. Eventually she figures out I already know what their starting package is, and at that point I agree to email her a counteroffer.

So I email her a counteroffer about 20% what their starting package. I also give her an offer letter I have from another company to show her that I’m getting more competitive offers from other places. She replies back the next day and says “we spent SO MUCH EFFORT coming up with this number” so “the offer is the offer”.

I cave at this point and agree to the on-site (I still thought this was my dream job at this point). After she finishes talking about the on site she said something that REALLY didn’t sit with well me.


“I’m sticking my neck out for you here, so you better sign if we give you an offer.”


So at this point I’m pissed. The on site with company A is scheduled to start tomorrow, and I DO NOT like what I’m seeing. At this point I immediately email company B, update them on the situation, and say “if I’m able to get an offer today and we can come to an acceptable compensation package, I will sign with you now and walk away from company A”

Company B send me an offer letter an hour later, and it’s quite acceptable.

So then I email my recruiter at company A, and tell them I’m walking away if I don’t get a counter offer. She congratulates me on my offer and that’s that.

I also had another job I wanted where I made it to the final interview round and during the interview they said they called my former employer and they now had concerns about my ability to fit in with other employees at the job...I really need someone to call my former employer and do a mock reference check to confirm if this is what they are doing and saying about me.

93,I'm struggling to find a new job using a different tech stack than my current position uses. What can I do to improve my chances of finding a new position with my preferred tech stack?,"I've been working in the field for a few years split between SDET work and full stack work at 2 different large enterprise companies. For backend work (which we have been pretty heavy on for awhile) I've used Java exclusively. I'm not enamored with Java as a language and don't want to be typecast as a Java dev forever so I've been looking to move on to a new tech stack. I started searching for a new job recently and have done a bit of tinkering in node.js in my off hours for around a month now and I've been liking it so far, but I wouldn't consider myself anywhere beyond novice level with it &amp; doubt I'll ever truly become strong with it unless I use it professionally full time.

Unfortunately, I'm in a bit of a pickle due to this. Outside of FAANG companies and occasional other large companies who are fine with whatever as long as you can do LC well (I admittedly can't yet, though I'm practicing) it seems like the vast majority of companies prioritize domain knowledge over general professional experience, probably since it's cheaper to avoid needing a new hire to pick up a new language and thus increasing their ramp up time. I usually make it past the resume screen (probably since I do have experience with Javascript/Typescript), but my lack of professional experience with node itself usually stops me from making it past HR because I don't have the right experience that they're looking for. 

I have a fair amount of freedom at my current job so I get some leeway into what technologies I use for smaller backend services. Is it worth pushing to use Node.js for some of these and taking a few months to get more experience writing the language in a professional environment then lying a bit to talk about how much I've actually used it, or is there another path I could take?",cscareerquestions,1636724758

-2 stats
-1 discrete math
-1 linear algebra

Ideally, I would like to have an offer (or internship) at one of the firms I've mentioned after graduating OSU, but if that doesn't happen then I'm planning to apply again after getting a grad certificate, again while studying for MSCS, and again after finishing my master's degree, if necessary.

1,What is my purpose?,"Hi Reddit. I am just an ordinary computer engineer with an ordinary background. It's been two years since I started to the industry. But the problem is, I don't know what am I doing right now. 

I was planning to resign from my current company. So I started to look at job postings. What I realize is, I got lost while building my career. At university, I was planning to be a good engineer, have a strong understanding of computer architecture, so I can improve myself on machine learning and artificial intelligence. But I was planning to be a good C and assembly programmer too, so I can use this knowledge to build my algorithms with high performance and minimal overhead. 

When I graduated, I was good with C and low-level concepts. Besides, I learned PyTorch and build my final project with it. I was planning to improve my knowledge about the fundamentals of machine learning so I can make my dreams real.

After I graduate, I got an offer from Japan. So I decided to accept it and today I am still happy that I accepted. 

In my current company, I am more like a backend developer. I say 'more like' because I don't know what am I anymore. I am trying to build an enterprise app around Laravel Framework. But this app needs some daemon services around and these services need speed and PHP is not enough. I am not saying that PHP is slow, but it is not enough for some tasks, so I developed several services with Java. Between PHP and Java, I implemented several connection protocols. I started with sockets, I tried some methods, today, they communicate with gRPC. Sometimes even Java wasn't enough, I used native libraries, I implemented them on JNI (thanks to my C background), which works like a charm today. We had some not generic data types on MySQL, which needs to be processed by some native libraries, so I implemented custom functions to MySQL using C, and today, all the processing is covered by MySQL. The whole algorithm works maybe 20 times faster. There is almost no overhead.

I am trying to explain my background because I know that there are seniors that already crossed that path. I feel lost. I feel satisfied with these problems, I love to solve them. I like my job. But I want to change company today, and I don't know what am I. When I look at positions, nothing fits me. Am I a backend developer? I know that there are better backend developers out there. What makes me special? Or maybe I am nothing. Because I feel like I don't have any expertise and I feel lost under all of the knowledge. 

These days, I am thinking about a master's degree. I don't want to go to the academy back, because I really feel like I want to use these skills in production, but maybe it can help to make my career path visible again.

3,Had a panic attack at work today.

I'm no longer going to prioritise work over my health. My right foot which has poor circulation and feels half-numb will be taken care of. I'll stop taking adderall which increased my anxiety even more. I'm going to meditate and do yoga. Lastly, I ordered myself a seat cushion which will hopefully help my back and sciatica.

Anyway, I tell her that 100k base salary would be the minimum for me: I have nine years of experience, the job would be remote and I live in a relatively large city in the Midwest.

After that she tells me they have been having trouble finding engineers at the P2 level (P1 would be entry level) and they're considering changing the requirements to P1 but the salary would be around 80k. I already knew where that was going and like I thought she mumbles something on the line of ""we don't want to waste your time of course so I wonder if that would be enough for you in case we switched to P1"".

I was fortunate enough to be part of a select few students who were invited to a university football game to meet and greet managers of an IT company. It was fun, and I'm glad for the opportunity. However all of these managers were IT solutions architect managers and similar/peripheral roles. 

I'm not sure how I got selected for this event in hindsight; seems like CIS-types would be more into these kinds of jobs. As a CS major, I want to do software engineering/development. I didn't hesitate to express that I wanted to focus more on software development and cultivate swe skills rater than IT solutions.

Anyway, it turns out that they liked me the most and had their manager reach out to me. He wants to meet for coffee. As a soon-to-be graduate with no job leads or offers, I was inclined to say yes. It could be of great informational value or even just a good networking/interview exercise for me. But what is the best way to navigate this meeting?

15,Need some advice on a Job Promotion/reposition,"I posted this comment in the Daily Chat yesterday, but I got some more information since then and wanted to know if this was the best move:

 

&gt;So recently I've been looking for roles outside of my Current one (QA Analyst) as I've been there nearly a year now and don't want to be in testing too long, and split between a couple of things,  
&gt;  
&gt;Basically my manager has offered me a place as part of a Third Line support but will mainly be bug fixing and a lot of code related work and minor feature fixes, he says this may be a good stepping stone to full dev within another year and gets me first hand knowledge on the codebase we use and may be easier to get experience without having a blank slate on newer features.  
&gt;  
&gt;But is this advisable compared with just finding a dedicated SWE role? Even starting at a Junior level? I suppose technically I would be classed as a SWE still and having some experience on my Resume is always going to be a bonus, but I'm not sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;For some background on my experience, I've posted it below:  
&gt;  
&gt;2/3 years out of University, now 33 years old, before this, I did IT tech work, security and retail stuff, I don't include those on my Resume but briefly mention I did work before University  
&gt;  
&gt;last 3 years I have experience in Customer Support Engineering (more problem solving for customers, some coding was involved for workarounds) and in that time, created most of their website  
&gt;  
&gt;Made redundant when they closed the office I was in, mostly due to COVID and had no room in London's Office, so out of a job for a little while  
&gt;  
&gt;Took a job as a QA Analyst with a view of progressing to Software Dev when I could (after a year or so) there is some coding involved and my skills as a web dev/ C# .Net do come in handy, they've allowed me access to look and learn the codebase and do seem like they want to promote me to Dev when its less busy (right now they need someone to hit the ground running)  
&gt;  
&gt;I recently updated my Resume and Linkedin and included my newer skills and Github Repos show newer projects I've been working on (mainly React and Leetcode Submissions (more as a place for notes on solutions))

As for my question, this role is officially classed/titled as ""Application Support Developer"" and although not discussed pay, would be worth more to me per year (currently on £30k as QA Analyst) but what worries me here is being pigeonholed into Support again or Testing when really I want to focus on SWE roles, but would this be a good step up into this, potentially skipping the Junior roles perhaps?",cscareerquestions,1636709257

I'm looking for an internship over the Summer 2021 and already have a software engineering internship offer for NCR that expires in the next few days, but I don't know if NCR is necessarily the right fit for what I want to do (I don't necessarily want to work for the banking industry and they only pay $30/hr, but I'll take it if it's the only thing I have). For reference of where I am in my college degree, I will graduate sometime in the Spring of 2023 with my undergrad degree at Georgia Tech. I will also be doing a one year master program, so I effectively only have 2 summers left. So here's my conundrum:

I can just accept the NCR offer for this coming summer and see if I can get better opportunities next summer. At that point, I would have just graduated with my Undergrad degree and working on my one year masters. I won't be devastated if I choose this option, but I will be kind of bummed thinking that there could have been other places that I could've worked at, or,

I can forgo that NCR offer and continue applying to places with a risk that I just won't get an offer at all, or the only offers I get won't be as good as the NCR offer. At this point, I haven't really applied to the big tech companies, but I did apply to Amazon and got ghosted. I've also been told that reneging is a thing that I could do, but that I shouldn't really do it because of its repercussions.

My goal is to point to get a chance to work at FAANG or any of the larger tech companies (either intern or full time), so I'm hoping to work for a company this summer that will allow me to stand out to recruiters.

I have been given a few offers so far, but most of them required me to take a gap semester and were more suitable for new graduates. I received an offer from a startup in Silicone Valley, but also having talked to the recruiters, I think I will get one from Infosys soon as they said that they are not planning to cull anymore candidates (I am in the final round interviews that place me in a suitable project).

The internship at the startup is a QA engineering role, which involves automated testing. I am happy with this offer, but given that it's not a software development role, I think that I will benefit more from Infosys' InStep internship where I hope to be placed in a software development project. I need to decide on my offer at the startup in about three days, and final round interviews at Infosys are happening after those three days.

31,When working remotely / overseas -- is the salary range including taxes (etc) or not?,"Hi. My whole career (nearly 10 years) have been as a proper employee, everything taken care of by the employer and the accounting departments. So I feel a bit lost.

I am currently looking into working remotely but I am a bit confused on how to charge.

Let's take a random job posting. They offer 100,000 USD, so that's what I would get before taxes. Let's assume the take home is 75,000 USD. 

Now imagine I want to apply for a job posting that specifies remote work and the salary also says 100,000 USD. Some questions:

* Since we are in different jurisdictions, they might not be able to process me as a normal employee. So the options could be
   * I start a company and invoice them the full 100,000 USD from that company and do some taxes
   * I give them my local bank and they transfer the full 100,000 USD, then I do some taxes myself

Since I have to do my own taxes which might be higher, I might end up with way way less than the 75,000 USD. Which brings me to the next question.

Usually when a company pays 100,000 USD as a salary, they have other costs such as medical and their taxes and whatnot. Maybe that employee actually costs 150,000-200,000 USD for them.

Due to this (taxes + lower employer costs) freelancers generally charge more (to pay taxes, medical etc) to end up with the same 75,000 USD. Right?

So. Should I as a remote/freelancer actually ask for MORE than what the job posting is specifying?

And for the low output, the new QAs are unable to understand/test properly the new code;

Overall passive attitude of the vendors;

Creating lots of bugs in prod, prod is now the new test environment XD ;

I have been discussing these issues with my manager and he says 'don’t worry do what you can' type of response.

Now I have been working 55+ hours a week just to try helping fix all the crap that has been deployed; For several months, this apart from on call That I am doing 1/X weeks,  the pager is ringing more and more, like... every day... this has become a nightmare.

I am not counting all the new responsibilities that are being thrown at me offside and that my boss is not giving training for and I need to spend 'of time' just in order to learn the new tech I have been asked to work for.

The business side of the things is irresponsible and accept all new features without providing serious quality standards;

I don't have a wife and/or kids... I feel like poor management is creating these problems. I have friends in IT who told me to GTFO I feel like I need a 'reset'; but also I think my managers trust me; The salary I get is average.

have I been making sacrifices for a company that is not worth it? Am I a retard?

So my questions: 

	Is this acceptable or even normal for a senior to work 60h/w even after 10 years in a company?

	How much time does the seniors here are spending 'of time' to cope with the new responsibilities?

What is your take on this situation?",cscareerquestions,1636694131
37,Having My Review Early Next Week And Am Severely Underpaid.. Any Tips?,"I started at my current place about 3 years straight out of school at $55k. I’m in a fairly large city and that pay was on the lower end for a junior dev, but not terrible. I have only gone up to $60k over the past two years and am still considered a “junior”. I haven’t really pushed for a raise until now and have confirmed I will be getting “promoted”. For my area, about $80-$95k would be fair. I have a feeling they’re going to offer me a “wonderful raise” to the the of around $65k or so.

I'm currently working at a Startup as a Front-End developer for 7 months and at a pretty well established company as a Full Stack developer for 2 months. 

For some reasons, i want to land a job in a new company. 
I have just applied to 50 companies last week and had over 10 rejections email so far. No interviews yet. 

A brief background, i only have high school diploma. I don't have CS degree and just attended Boot Camp last year. 
My experience with JavaScript has been around 1.5 years so far. 
I'm working with React, Node, Nest JS, MySQL / MariaDB, and vanilla JavaScript at these current company. 

However, I don't have my own portfolio website yet as i'm still building it. 
I have 2 paid freelancing projects so far. 
So I only put my current jobs and those 2 projects on my resume. 

Do you guys think that's enough?
Do I need to build some more personal projects and wait for my portfolio to be done or do I need to stick with my current job longer before I continue to apply to Front End / Full Stack jobs again?
Any advices related to my position?

39,Underachieving guilt,"TLDR: how do I stop feeling guilty for getting paid a high salary to do fuck all? 

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I recently started with a new company on a 6 figure salary, and feel like I’m not doing enough work. I found I can vastly overestimate tasks and just do 1-2hrs of work a day, and everyone seems impressed with my work. The problem is that for the rest of my day I feel riddled with guilt for not being productive. But if I try to work through the day 5 days a week I just find myself feeling so burned out.

As a bit of background, I’m in Australia, still getting my bachelors at uni part time, so this is a pretty good gig salary-wise. Company is a startup only a few years old and is absolutely not something I’m at all passionate about - I like money. Sticking around until I finish uni in about a year and then going for a FAANG/MANGA job is the plan right now.

40,Background check for no-W2 experience?,"I'm wondering what's typical to include on a background check form. I'm doing this through HireRight in the US.

I've had two paid, full-time positions since graduation. However, on my resume, I also have:

* Unpaid undergraduate CS research experience at my university
* Independent day trading experience where I made $xxx,xxx
* Failed startup experience as a co-founder that joined an accelerator

HireRight doesn't give you an option to enter any of those three accurately. I.e. all past experience entered through their application portal needs to be:

* Paid either directly by your employer or through a third-party
* Or paid *and* self-employed

In other words, they only allow you the option to enter paid positions that are verifiable through W2s.

I ended up choosing to leave those three items out of the background check form as there wasn't a way to accurately enter them through their site.

Would this be acceptable? If HR comes asking why I've omitted some things on the background check form that were on my resume, I'd explain that there was no option to accurately enter those three experiences on their website.",cscareerquestions,1636690823

43,Should I consider SDET role for 40% more pay?,"I interviewed for a Systems Engineer position at a start-up. However, they are looking for a more Senior SE but invited me to come onsite for an SDET role instead. 

My ideal role would be SDE or Systems Engineer (DSP algorithms). I currently work as the latter at a stable company and like my job other than the mediocre pay. My main concern is there seems to be a stigma around SDET and if I am paving a career in testing rather than developing that I can't get out of later, I'd rather stay in my role.

On the other hand, this might be a good opportunity to break into SDE. My background is not in CS so I've had trouble clearing LC interviews at big N companies. Recruiter said there will most likely not be whiteboard coding for onsite and it is more of an informal meet and greet with the team. The bottom of the salary range is still a 40% increase from my current role and their salary range is the same across all roles (SDE, SDET, Systems, Firmware) which makes me believe it would be easy to make a lateral movement. Recruiter mentioned there would be opportunities to wear many hats if something else piques my interest but not sure if I should take his word for it.

Is SDET on your resume as bad as people make it out to be on Reddit/Blind? Or should I take the SDET if given an offer?

45,Deciding Between New-Grad Offers - Deloitte (NYC) vs CapitalOne (Wilmington) PLEASE HELP!,"I am a senior graduating with a computer science degree, and currently have two offers that I have a few weeks to decide on, and I would really like some help.

One is from Deloitte, in the position of Solutions Engineer Analyst, with a starting salary of $90K in New York City. The other is from CapitalOne, for a classic Software Engineer position in the TDP (Technology Development Program), with a starting salary of $116K in Wilmington, Deleware.

Though on the surface it might seem like an easy choice because of a significant salary difference, location is really big for me, as I really thrive off exciting life outside of work/school, and I have completely fallen in love with NYC and all the opportunities for that there. Because of this, and with Deloitte still being a livable wage, I am quite heavily leaning towards Deloitte.

**However, my main reservation is in fact with the work itself.** I have done two summer internships, both of which were traditional software dev positions, both specifically being full-stack web development. CapitalOne seems to offer something much closer to that, and I feel like I am guaranteed a much more ""safe"" route career- and experience-wise with it.

In order words, I feel like if I do move on from my first job, CapitalOne's position description and the experience I got from it would be taken quite well by other companies with traditional software development jobs.

With Deloitte, on the other hand, it's not so clear. Firstly, the work would change every few months as I switch projects. Secondly, it's hard to know what my day-to-day could look like, how similar it would be to a normal software engineering job at CapitalOne, for example. Because of this, my fear is that if I moved on from Deloitte, my experience wouldn't be valued as seriously and I would have started my full-time career on a bad foot if I'm going down the software development route, which so far is where I've been going and likely see myself continuing down.

**So my main question is really:** are my reservations about this fairly accurate? Would this position from Deloitte not be considered as seriously by, say, a job recruiter later down the line for a normal software job? Or is it not really the case, and software work at Deloitte is taken as respectfully as with a company like CapitalOne.

Any and all advice is appreciated! Additionally, if something else sticks out to you that you'd like to bring up to me, I'd really appreciate that as well. Thank you everyone!",cscareerquestions,1636687325

I'd love to be able to PM you, but here are some of the things I am most interested in (I've also already shot off an email to recruiter asking some of these):

1. What's the potential like for getting an offer to return full-time after graduation?
2. How did they pay you? My offer was ""the annualized equivalent of $75K, paid semi-monthly."" Like, if the internship is 10 weeks, wud I get (10 / 52 weeks in a year) \* $75K or (10 / 4-ish weeks in a month) \* ($75K / 12 months in a yr). I'm guessing it'd be closer to the former option?
3. What's just the general vibe of the workplace? When I asked the four ppl there who interviewed me what they liked about the company, they were usually like ""We use really modern technologies, the people are smart, and you're encouraged to work hard and grow."" And like the answer I was looking for there was like ""the people are great."" Not necessarily a deal breaker but definitely something to consider so I'd like to hear people's experiences.
4. For people who have worked there, what does the starting salary/salary trajectory look like? I've scoured glassdoor and all that shit but I feel like it's still really hard to tell from that alone.

I'm few months into learning, it's going okay, not fast but steady. My current job is also stable, moderately interesting, not stressful and I even have some extra time to learn. I've been here for almost 6 years though, kinda bored of it overall.

I recently got an offer in another big famous company for the same role as I do here. It will look great on a resume, it's more money, potentially more interesting stuff, but also very busy. Overtime most likely. I won't have no time to fulfill my coding dream. (Although recruter says they can have some internal trainings and if I really want to they can eventually transfer me to be a developer.)

This career in general for me is moderately interesting, but I don't see myself doing that for too long. I am already doing if for too long. It's fine, but not what I really want or passionate about.

Should I do a reality check and take this offer in a new company with more money and new maybe better and at least different environment? Is that a chance of a lifetime that I'm missing? I think I'm getting less hirable the longer I stay in my current company...

Or should I continue coding for 1-2 more years to see if that works out for me well? Stakes are high, I have plans for it - remote jobs, own projects, software companies, etc. But so as that new job offer that I can miss and never have again and be stuck here forever.",cscareerquestions,1636683988

Overall I would say that the experience has been great. I've been learning a lot about software development at my start up and understanding what it means to actually build a project from the ground up. It's a lot of work but it's very rewarding. 

Recently, I've been thinking about the different paths I can take with my skill set in the future and what I could do on the side or perhaps what could become my main source of work if all goes well.

I understand that it's different than just being a backend developer. I would be dealing with customers and providing customer support on my own.

As the title mentions, I've been a web dev for 7+ years (and even more than that if I count the sites I've worked on before I started my career). I've always been using PHP (+ the usual frontend stack html/css/js/js frameworks). That's what I learned before I started working and I've been happy with it. However, I feel limited by it, I rarely see interesting opportunities for PHP dev. As for skills, I don't think I can push it a lot further. So I've been thinking moving on to something else.

I think I should be ok, since it's not the first language I'll learn, it seems pretty standard to me. I have no idea if a company looking for a python dev would hire someone like me.

My first semester, I was a mechanical engineering major, but after some thought have made the switch to CS. Here are just a few questions I have that I was hoping you guys could answer:

1. As a CS major, is there any minor I should take/ or maybe a potential double major? 

2. As of right now I’m a freshman, but coming into college I had 7 credits, took 18 credits this semester, am taking 21 next semester (its a lot I know) and than plan on taking atleast 10 in the summer (once I get 56 credits I’m considered junior status). Ive been told once I hit junior status, that opens the door for a lot more internships and associate software engineering roles as most want you to be atleast junior status. Is there any benefit to this strategy? (Currently 4.0 GPA btw)

3. What should I do on the side to make myself Look better? I was told do a lot of side projects which I am doing right now. I’m currently doing a UDEMY Web Dev course where by the end you have 4-5 projects already done (personal portfolio page, small game). The langauges are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also some other ones I wasn’t too familiar with, can provide later if need be. I take my first coding class next semester (intro to python).

4. What’s the best way to land an internship? I don’t go to a top tier school rather a regular state school in Michigan. What edge can I get against other interns to make up for the school I go to (if that’s even a thing). From what I’ve heard experience is king, so the more internships I do the better. 

5. I was told by a friend that AWS Certs will help me a-lot in landing jobs and internships  as well. He suggested doing the Solutions Architects Associate &gt; a second one I can’t remember&gt; and than Aws dev ops last. Is this true, if it is I’ll start studying so I can take the exam in the summer.

Here is my story: for the last 6 years I have been working in a typical consulting company. My main expertise is embedded software and that's the main type of project I was working on. Additionally, I was also doing typical full stack development (backend services, web applications), was architectured cloud platforms, managed CI/CD build systems , did mobile application development and even some data analysis. In other words: whatever needed to be done, I was doing that. Apart from my main work I also did some side contracts/projects in the mentioned areas.

I got the opportunity to move to the new startup (focused in couple domains), but since they are mostly focused on the research, my start role would be DevOps with occasional general software development (they are just starting, so I understand they need to build many things at once). I was also told they are open to moving me to a different role once they got more clarified goals and requirements, but at the same time they want to know what are my plans for the future.

While I was thinking what sparked a joy past those couple years I realised everything is interesting to me to some degree. I like doing cloud development, writing embedded code, play with full-stack, even make mobile apps.

currently, I'm again working on FE changes which should have been straightforward— I was told they would be really similar to the last iteration but there are some extra stuff I need to do. however I’m running into a ton of issues and after researching online, I realized that some are because of a misunderstanding I had about the ui library I’m using (vague for privacy). I went back to my first PR and saw I made *this exact mistake* *in like 4-5 places throughout* but magically it never broke my program— but why did no one comment on this on my PR? sure it *worked* but isn’t that the bare minimum?  (plus now because I didn’t know my mistake and worked off of code that’s bad practice *at best*, I can’t even get my new code to work, and that’s gonna be blamed on me) knowing the error now, I don’t understand how someone who actually knows how to use this library didn’t say “hey you can't call this function like this, it might cause issues later”. my PR is not closed because we need to wait on other changes first, but it’s been out for enough time for people to put comments and for me to respond to them.

there’s only one actual FE guy on the team so I get that he’s busy, but my perspective is that if the only person who’s able to help me with my code can’t get 30 mins to properly read through a \~700 line PR sometime in weeks (it went out to my whole team and he did leave a few comments but as mentioned before, they were trivial stuff so I just feel like he didn't really even read it), then a project involving significant front-end work should not be given to an intern. I’ve generally been performing badly due to multiple factors that I have varying degrees of control over, but this incident in particular has me frustrated because some of the bugs that are delaying my project could have been avoided if someone noticed my shitty code the first time around— or maybe I was expected to not write shitty code in the first place and this is all my fault, idk. 

tell me if I'm being needy, or is it reasonable to want people to point out stuff in your code that might be problematic later and help you out when you have (obvious, now) gaps in knowledge? was my PR so big that no one actually felt like reading through it? I'm not sure how long it takes to read and comment on a PR, and I feel like it’s rude to directly ask “but did you look at my code PROPERLY” if I only get a few comments lol. I’ll be an FTE next year (not on this team, I don’t think they even want me back lol) and I just want to know in the future how to get a decent code review :( ",cscareerquestions,1636675924

Recently I have been feeling very tired. Last week there were days where I was so tired I barely made any progress. Life outside of work is probably contributing to this. I'm trying to find a place to live , so i drive 2.5 hours to the city (and same back) where the job is to view an apartment about every 2/3 weeks after work. (I kind of want to move out of my parents away from my sometimes stressful siblings, but at the same time am nervous of moving out on my own...)

My manager and my managers manager have only good things to say in my one to ones. Today they asked me to take on some more responsibility, and I was cautious in my response. I explained that my tasks were stacking up against me recently, but ultimately I said yes because I feel it's bad to say no to any ask of me this early in my job/career.

The extra responsibility isn't too much anyway. Just run a few meetings, keep track of some ongoing issues, and nudge people to do a task every now and then. (Basically look after operational processes on our team). Plus this kind of thing might look good on the resume in time.

I dropped out of college and went active duty military about a year and a half ago. My highest math level is college algebra. I watched calculus on Khan Academy for a bit, but it seems I need to learn more of the foundations before I can confidently continue. Many say to learn linear algebra and discrete math, but I’ll need to know how to work up to that level. 

I’m currently learning the basics of Python. My goal with this is to at least have an understanding of programming when I take CompSci courses. Some say don’t even worry about coding, that the university courses will square me away. Others say keep coding and do projects, so I’m a little confused.

82,Choosing between two vastly different offers,"So, I have an opportunity to join Salesforce. The kicker is that it's not a SWE role; it's something dubbed ""System Engineer"".

I had a hard time figuring out what exactly they mean by that as the JD thew a kitchen sink of requirements out: python, node, JavaScript, AWS, sql, variety of other stuff.

I was able to figure out that it's basically a support role that is somewhere between a dev and SRE: poke around various setups to identify problems caught in monitoring, create and upkeep said monitoring, etc. it's a new team in a new org so things are in flux and by the sounds of it, many hats are required.

The neat thing is there are no stand-ups or sprints, which sounds great to me, because I'm tired of that.

The other company is a Fintech medium sized company in the Midwest that's building a greenfield project. I really liked the people I interviewed with there (SF on the other hand is faceless and corporate as you can imagine, though I hear it's a good place to work)

Both companies are contract-to-hire. Both companies pay the same.

I think what I'm looking for is somewhere I could coast a bit more so SF sounds better in that regard (it's easier to coast in huge megacorps in my experience) but again, it's extremely vague wtf a systems engineer does - I don't want to be on a 12 hour long sev1 call every day.

83,What to do about team senior who never responds to emails/IMs/etc?,"Hey all, got a bit of an annoying issue to figure out but not sure how to best go about it.

So I'm a couple of months into my first SWE role and everything has been great so far! Everyone on my team is friendly and always willing to show me stuff I don't know, the tasks I'm being given are ramping up at a fair pace, and it seems like everything else is pretty good!

However, probably the biggest and easily most annoying issue is one I have with one of the senior devs on my team. Everyone else is super easy to reach, whether it be that they respond immediately to my messages or they're available at their desk when I need to pop in for something. But this senior dev is NEVER available and ALWAYS has an excuse to why they can't answer my question when I have one.

Now this wouldn't be so bad and I really wouldn't care that he's never available if it weren't for the fact that almost all of my tasks at the moment revolve around a weird domain space that only he knows well enough to answer questions for. It's especially a huge pain when I need him to review almost all my PRs (since I'm just a junior and don't want to mess things up) but he has yet to let me know whether the work I'm doing is actually correct.

Many of my other tasks given to me were reviewed by other seniors on the team that could and each person gave solid feedback as to what I did well/wrong to improve, but this senior dev never responds to emails, never reviews my PRs, and the ones I have merged into the codebase after days of not hearing back never even get brought up again.

Basically, I know I sound like a broken record now, but it's just really frustrating that this happens. I've brought it up with other members of the team too and they all jokingly (with a tone of seriousness too) agree that he's never available. However, it seems that they all still EVENTUALLY get their problems resolved, but I can't help shake the feeling that he never gets to me since I'm just the new junior dev and my issues pale in comparison to everything else the others are working on. Doesn't help too that it seems like his reputation as an engineer is regarded highly by people both in and out of my project team.

85,Offered what sounds like a bad job with good pay,"So I've been looking for a job for almost a year now. I finally got an offer but the company sounded really horrible as I read their offer letter. I have about a year and a half of work experience so I'm still very much a junior dev. The offer letter(well, email) included things like telling me that there were many junior devs and basically how the company would not pay much for my skills. Also, how most people leave anyway because they realise they hate dev work or the complexity of the work they do.  It was them basically saying I'm replaceable so they put me on a probation. The job itself sounds rigid with no room for mistakes or questions. I fee like these things are part of the development process. I try to avoid mistakes but questions will always come up. They literally said to not ask questions and if you do, you ask just once. They also expect me to hit the ground running with a contribution target for the first month. I feel like almost everything they said was what most companies are thinking but they don't word it that way. The email sounded really ""angry"". More of a ""enjoy the next 24 hours"" vs ""enjoy your day"" situation.


On the flip side, they didn't offer me the money I asked for but since I overasked,  the amount they settled on is my desired rate. Furthermore, this amount increases monthly and in a couple of months I'll be earning the amount I asked for and when they stop increasing it 4 months later, I will be earning way more than I thought I could earn with my experience. So basically the pay is good. Their company culture not so much. My offer letter felt like it was written by an angry employee who was leaving. It baffles me how the people who interviewed me have been there for 2+ and 5+ years. 

I am accepting the offer because I have no other options but I guess I wanted to see if anyone has been through a horrible job with great pay. My sister thinks I should take it, make my money, and leave. Also, it's remote so how bad could it possibly get? I'm just scared to be miserable for months and possibly, years. The company was okay on paper and during the interview, but now I'm concerned.

Ideally as much coding and exposure to different technologies as possible, I’ll probably exit into tech in a year or two. 

I really liked what the Deloitte partner had to say about possible placements for me. Development oriented projects or pen testing, things of that nature. My background is in development, not Cyber. I’m sure they have plenty of tools and internal/external development to work on? I hope that’s the case because I definitely don’t want to get sucked into monitoring and analysis or anything like that.

On the other hand EY won’t even tell you the sub group you’ll be placed in before accepting your offer. Some of the groups sound really interesting, but I honestly have no idea what they entail. The recruiter said there’s a need for engineers/programmers so I don’t need to worry about that skill going to waste. Is that true or am I gonna be pushing power points?

[I just finished my portfolio website](https://zachariejones.com/) and I'm trying to figure out if I'm ready for my first position as a web developer.

**So far I feel comfortable with the following:**

* **HTML**
* **CSS** (I love working with CSS)
* **JavaScript** (I feel like I have a good grasp on the fundamentals, but there's always more to learn)
* **React** (I've built about 4 or 5 small projects in react and 3 larger full sites in react, I feel fairly comfortable with state management, manipulating data from APIs, etc)
* **WordPress** (I've built at least 10 WordPress sites for various projects and at companies I've been at previously)
* **Shopify** (I used to run a small eCommerce business that was fairly successful (\~$30k in revenue - high ticket items)

**Things I've dabbled in and but I'm not 100% comfortable with:**

* **NodeJS/Express** (I've built a couple of APIs just from courses but nothing substantial)
* **NextJS** (I've used it in a couple of courses but no actual projects)
* **AWS/Digital Ocean/Google Cloud** (I've spun up a few servers for other projects but haven't done any real hosting -- I usually use something like Heroku or Netlify)

I know there's still a TON more for me to learn, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to even start applying yet. I've submitted a few applications but I was wondering if there was anything that I should be doing to stand out better.

Do you think my projects are up to the quality that's expected for an entry-level front end job? I'm currently working on other projects as well.

We’ve been having a lot of issues with tasks not having descriptions or being extremely vague or no one having any idea what the merge criteria is. We have to keep deferring to our engineering a manger, (she’s great don’t get me wrong, she’s super helpful), because she’s the only one that knows what we’re supposed to be doing. She’s also completely bogged down and busy *because* of this so it’s really difficult to get in time with her to get the requirements. 

The company seems like it’s struggling to figure out how to adequately dole out tasks and we’ve gone through three different types of sprint methodologies. They haven’t asked us developers what should improve and we’re sort of being blamed for work not getting done despite finishing the tasks given to us. It also seems like if our engineering manager left the company, the company would be completely screwed. Also, 2/3 of the developers have worked at the company for less than a year and it seems like they may have hired a few too many of us (or not enough, I can’t really tell).

I've been researching careers in CS a lot and I have friends that are programmers and some have ADHD, and they have told me that it is actually a popular career among those with ADHD. I feel like I have a lot of strengths, and I have always had a ""math brain"" and I picked up on C++ really fast, in fact I was only 1 of 2 people to pass the class (maybe a bad teacher, idk), but my strengths are not in listening to people talk for extended periods of time without me getting much of a turn to give my input day in and day out. I didn't understand how much of patient care would be just listening and listening. I thought there would be more chances for me to use my logical reasoning and help people and it wouldn't be all about keeping patients happy, but the for profit healthcare business creates these situations where patient reviews hold a lot of weight for reimbursement and business. I like to do things right and safe, but that doesn't make people happy (think people wanting unsafe levels of controlled substances). 

I just ranted for a bit, sorry. 

TL;DR: In your opinion, is it a bad career move to switch from working as an Nurse Practitioner to getting another bachelor's in CS to ultimately be able to work as a programmer?",cscareerquestions,1636663440

My brother inspired me because he taught himself Kubernetes and does training all by himself for the Linux foundation (I could be remembering wrong). He gave me some resources to start out with.

I'm living entirely on SSI/supplemental security income--it's only about 800 dollars a month and I'm struggling. I write novels (I've written 12) but I doubt I could live off the income from publishing them. I still want to try that, of course, but I have a TON of spare time in which I could teach myself a new skill.

I have a bachelor's in psychology with high GPA but I don't want to work in that field. It's just too stressful and depressing. I was rejected for a school psychology master's program, most likely due to lack of work/'real world' experience. It's been four years or so since I graduated.

Anyway, my question is--do work at home, on demand computer science jobs exist, and would it be feasible for me to hold such a job with my disability? Such as, do I have the choice to work or not work depending on how I am functioning that day or week? Or could I do a part-time job?

I wonder if anyone else has given serious thought to an approach for dealing with [inflation](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), and our current salaries in  IT. Maybe there's a big gap in my thinking here, but if inflation keeps at its current pace, what once was a decent salary is now diminishing over a short time horizon. From what I am seeing/hearing from recruiters and [surveys](https://www.idginsiderpro.com/article/3607982/it-salary-survey-2021-compensation-holds-steady-despite-pandemic.html), offered salary ranges are trending upward to contend with the inflated dollar and increased demand. Some approaches that came to mind:   


* Find a new opportunity, better salary | Level of difficulty: Not hard 
* Renegotiate salary, title, position, etc| Level of difficulty: Almost impossible with most organizations 

The leverage is on the side of the experienced IT Professional given the shortage of talent and the increasing need for organizations to move workloads to the cloud, modernizing legacy applications, and deploying more and more advanced tools to achieve organizational goals. That said, I've only heard of and seen organizations matching offers for folks looking to take other opportunities elsewhere (the consensus being accepting counter offers as [not good overall](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140619114149-115601827-career-mistakes-1-never-accept-counter-offers-after-you-resign)).

38,I've been browsing this sub for the last month and here's the questions I still have,"First off I want to give you the position I'm in. I'm a college dropout currently sludging through the service industry. I want to make a shift into the tech industry without going into debt and making a somewhat decent living with a useful skill that I'm genuinely interested in learning.

Here's what I think I know. 

It's not some get rich quick scheme or an easy way to make money. It takes hard work and dedication and my expectations have been thoroughly grounded.

It's possible to get into without a degree. But just because a degree isn't necessarily required doesn't mean it's easy and I'm going to be competing with people who do have some sort of certification and experience making the journey even harder. That being, said I'm open to any cheaper alternatives to learning and certification.

Coding isn't necessarily about which or how many languages you know but rather your ability to effectively use your toolset to solve certain problems or complete certain tasks. At least I think so.

Communication skills are important. Being able to effectively communicate with people you're working with is an essential skill in coding. I'm not gonna be locked up in my room typing away by myself forever. As someone who's spent the better part of a decade serving tables I'd like to think not only are my people skills up to post but I like to believe my ability to translate my knowledge to make it more easily digestible is also pretty good.

There is no guarantee. There have been many people before and will be many people after myself who've taken this journey only to either quit or be massively disappointed by what was waiting for them. 

All this being said I still want to pursue this and this place is currently the best resource I have for granular knowledge about the subject so here's the questions I have.

What are the specific machinations of the jobs in certain areas of coding? I know this is a loaded question so I'll try my best to clarify. For example if you're developing an app on a team what would your day to day look like? What assignments would you be given? You don't have to stick to my example I'm interested in what the actual desk work is like across as many different areas as possible.

What in your opinion would be the best resource for starting? I'm leaning heavily towards starting with Java and using that as a base for learning C++. I personally wouldn't mind venturing into video games or app related jobs and C++ seems to be a good choice for either. If I'm wrong what would you recommend?

Are there any places that offer classes and certifications on par with a degree? I know bootcamps are an option but from what I can tell they get pretty expensive as well and a lot of people here seem to have a ""it helps but it's not everything"" attitude towards it. Would you recommend bootcamps as an alternative to school?

And lastly, realistically how much could someone like myself expect to make if we assume everything goes right? Again another loaded question that depends on a variety of factors but I really just want to know if I live as conservatively as possible as a single person with no kids would I at least be able to pay my bills without worry? 

In the end I'm looking for an industry where I can fully apply myself towards something Im actually interested in and keep my head above water. I don't care if it takes my l me 20 years I've set my mind to this journey and I will achieve it.

Thanks in advance for any advice or information. I appreciate all input.",cscareerquestions,1636658921
39,Mechanical Engineer considering transition to software engineering.,"I'm a young mechanical engineer (23M). Graduated with an ME degree in 2020, and immediately started working at a firm making \~70k now in the Phoenix area.   


I've always wanted to do some coding and recently I've been thinking about the possibility of transitioning to software development (1-1.5 years from now). I've also heard there's a huge potential for income growth, which is a plus. Has anyone else made this switch recently and how did it go?

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to have a remote job if it were available, since the idea of relocation is tough (wife, 1yo baby, house), or something in the area if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

To start this, I've looked into many bootcamps and courses and I think I will start with something free (Odin Project or Free Code Camp) and if I decide I like it enough to make it a career, in like 6 months or so, I can decided to do a paid bootcamp or some sort of ISA program, if it's recommended. I plan on this taking a year to transition since I don't have a ton of free time to invest because of my current work, wife, baby care, and other things that happen in life. It would be some weekday nights/weekends when possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another point of contention is income. I know that switching careers can potentially lead to an initial income decrease until I gain experience/switch to a different, higher paying position. Unfortunately we are not really in a position to afford a decrease in income, as my wife is a SAHM. I would try to pursue a job paying at least the same amount, if not more than I currently make. 

&amp;#x200B;

What if we created a workspace where we could build and encourage one another? Like a voice chat where you don't *HAVE TO* chat but rather just chill and work together with some soft music playing.

If you need help, there are others right there.

Shall we make such a thing?

I’m feeling disillusioned. My job pays well, and I like the work enough, but there is no WLB. Plus, I don’t think the opportunity to make the millions that my bosses have made is there anymore. 

I’m thinking about transitioning to tech but on the finance/strategy side (but not FP&amp;A). I like to think I have transferrable skills like Excel modeling, deal/project management, executive-level communications, and overall ability to learn quickly.

71,"Making a lateral move with paycut, is it worth it. Have you taken a paycut for a role?","I've been working as a software engineer for over 4 years. 2 years were working in data engineering. 2+ years working on the frontend, and this is what I do at my current job.

I only learn while working and don't really like to spend time outside of work programming. I like to relax outside of my work hours and recharge

Because of this, I don't grow that fast and I really only grow from whatever I build at work. I don't really enjoy frontend so I'm looking to make a move towards a more full-stack role or backend role.

I recently interviewed with 2 companies.

One is an early startup and seems like they are highly focused on producing work, so it'll be a grind. After interviewing with them, they have expressed interest and I'm waiting on their offer. It will be a full-stack role with a lot of plans for backend projects.

The other company is a later stage startup and would be a backend role. They have given me an offer that is $20k lower than what I make now. Their medical benefits are also not as great as what I get at my current work, and they don't offer a 401k match. They offered $22k equity with 4-year vesting schedule, but these are options to buy). They offer 3 weeks PTO. Full remote. Team seemed great and super knowledgeable

My current company, I get unlimited vacation but I don't really use up much vacation time, so fixed PTO seems better for me. I will be expected to go back into the office next year (we were remote during covid only). Frontend only role. Great medical benefits. I have no serious medical conditions.

Just looking at it financially, it just doesn't make sense to make this move. But, given my lack of knowledge in backend and my desire to fill that gap, I'm very interested in the opportunity. The engineers I met at both companies have been great and seemed knowledgeable. The early startup will be hiring me as a mid/senior level, whereas the later stage startup is actually hiring me as a junior. Not sure how I got offers at both these companies at such a varying level, but that is how it has ended up.

Has anyone experienced something similar where you make some lateral move (or even a lower role), and do you think it was worth it? Is the potential knowledge gain worth the lower compensation?",cscareerquestions,1636649181

74,What are things I can do to transition from Tech Support Engineer to SE?,"I have my degree in CS with almost my masters in CS. I have 2 years experience as software engineer but was laid off last August from covid. Due to needing income I took a job as Technical Support Engineer that pays about 80K. However, this is not where I want to be long term as I don't enjoy it as much as software engineering and the career growth is limited. I also don't have a ton of free time now that I am working to be searching/interviewing/etc.

I was thinking some good things to do would be focus on database/scripting/etc as much as possible in this new role so I can still gain on those. Was also considering doing a side project in my free time with Java/Spring and could add it to projects during this time. Would it be bad idea to list my resume job title in this role as SE and list tasks that I do here related to SE? They wan't me to learn their software in and out so I can help troubleshoot it with customers, but this is not really a transferrable skill. If I was learning Java/DB/etc I would be more motivated because its a long term transferrable skill.

Ideally I want to jump back to programming/SE in 6-12 months. I did let my new manager know about this so potentially I could switch to engineering within this company.

82,Red flags for a staffing firm?,"I one day when feeling bad about my ridiculously bad compensation and poor outlook for getting a raise decided to update my resume and just... see what's out there. I wasn't very popular last year when I had only a degree and no experience. I've got almost 6 months experience now and the job shortage is even worse, so maybe something will happen. At the very least, boost my ego. I go ahead and fill out a single indeed application. the next morning, not 12 hours later, I have a phone call from the company I applied to. It was literally the first job on indeed. I wasn't REALLY considering switching, at least until my work refused my raise. But I entertained it.

It was an american man (I'm sorry to sound prejudice, I understand that indian people make up a gigantic part of the tech world, but i get 200 emails a day from indian startups, so even if its incorrect, american recruiters give me some sense of legitimacy) and he said his staffing firm is currently staffing for a large famous pharmaceutical company.

Before I go further, I want to say that this staffing firm is Called StarsHr. I cannot find ANY real reviews about them other than their own website and socials. I see there's an entry for them on the BBB but its not filled out.

The large pharmaceutical company bought a smaller medical company some years back thats about 10 miles from where I live (I looked it up and that is correct). They are staffing software developers to help with ""automated dye injection tech"" whatever that means. Speaking to the recruiter, things went well, and he said he would be sending me some emails.

I got the emails, the staffing firm would be my employer, the contract is 1 year but that this particular client almost always hired people on. It offers benefits (maybe SLIGHTLY worse than my current ones, but acceptable, including dental). Most importantly, he asked how much I hoped to make. I probably would have told him a better number, but I at the time wasn't really considering the offer. I said I have to make more than 65k. To which he was very surprised I was making less than that currently (lol).

He said that he had to have me fill out of letter of exclusivity per this client's rules (the pharmaceutical company, not the staffing company). It was a standard boiler plate guidant global letter of exclusivity. I read the whole thing every word, its scope is only for this one company, and only for the one position ID (i made sure to check out the listing on guidant global and the position is real. I know scammers often find real positions, but at the very least its a real position).

I had never done a letter of exclusivity before, and I looked it up. apparently a lot of employers who use staffing companies do it so that they don't have the same candidate applying to the same position from like 15 agencies.

He emailed me today asking if I could do an interview on friday. I said sure, what kind of interview? Technical with coding/whiteboarding or a behavior interview. He said it would be with their hiring manager (who's name he gave me, I looked up him, he's on linked in as someone working for that pharmaceutical company) and would be just basic ones about my qualifications, then later we would do a MS teams interview with a panel and some coding.

He emailed me a few hours later to say he was mistaken, they're going to forego the phone screening and behavior part and its going to be the MS teams meeting on friday. Panel of 4. The hiring manager, his team lead, and people on the team who were previously from the same staffing company but are now full time there.

He said the staffing company president wants to talk to me tomorrow on the phone and give me a ""more detailed pre-interview briefing"". That... was weird to me.

So for starters, does anything jump out at you. Anything look like a red flag. Second, if not, what red flags should I look out for? Anything I definitely should never do or ever sign? And lastly, have you EVER heard of starsHR? All the people named have linkedin accounts with robust activity, hundreds of connections at real companies, several endorsements. Just seems like a scam for some reason",cscareerquestions,1636645011

I have already taken the two intro courses and discrete math. I’m currently taking data structures and the course is kind of disorganized to say the least. The assignments have been kind of vague and it’ll take some time before someone gets to your question. I don’t think it also helps that there are about &gt;200 students from two sections and about a little more than 10 TA’s and 1 instructor. It also kind of sucks that we don’t have enough practice doing problems that apply concepts that we learned in lecture.

I realize the nature of this class tends to be difficult, but I didn’t realize it was going to be this chaotic. I want to keep trying if learning this stuff is much harder to learn on my own since I’m already doing a fair amount of self studying for this class as it is.

So now if I want to study cybersecurity without knowledge in programming or coding will I be fine, I have no problem using youtube and other sources if I didn't understand while attending the university

I started developing for personal fun a few years back. Nothing fancy, just some web stuff. Actually, it made me really frustrated and I quit for a while (a bad habit of mine that it took nearly 25 years to break...) but I've gotten... Decent at it. I can do backend stuff with my eyes closed and I hate frontend with a burning passion.

To me, programming is more computational than some JavaScript web framework, CSS or some basic CRUD database access... It's number crunching, algorithms, it's figuring out how to best use the hardware you have in front of you to accomplish some task that barely fits in the available parameters.

These kinds of things get me excited. Have any of you ready about RICE university's SLIDE algorithm? It's a neural network that beats the same size network run on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 on a CPU! That's nuts!

Anyways, not much I come across excites me except for the idea of these technologies that I have no use for. I'm like a walking solution with no problem, and it's really kicking my ass lately. I can't stick with a programming language, a project, or anything because, well, the things I want to build and work on I just simply don't have a use for. Part of this is likely depression and my lack of going out and enjoying life so I have nothing to apply my development to, but damn, it's hard battling those two opposing things at once.

I've come here for advice, not to whine, which I've already failed at (look at me go!). I'm looking for help figuring out what direction to take. What thing could I study or look into, what problems can I work on that incorporate my TRUE interests *(high performance computing, parallelism, clusters, super computers, just flat out burning hardware at the highest temp it will go and utilizing as many resources as possible at once. I like BIG stuff that I simply don't have access to*), but also without going to get a master's degree in something I don't *actually* want to study? I can develop neural networks, sure, I could explore data analysis and other ML algorithms, I could probably build image classifiers from scratch. Hell, I could even save up and build a full on Beowulf cluster out of NVIDIA Jetson Nanos and run all of these projects on them, but the sad truth is, all of that is useless and incredibly non-driving if you don't have something to apply it to, which I don't...

**Starting as a Junior .NET Developer**

In november 2020 I got the opportunity to start at a big firm as a Junior .NET Developer within a team that focused on implementing, extending and customizing MS Dynamics Connected Engagement applications (Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, Project Operations...). Not exactly knowing what I was really jumping into I can definitely say the first +-6 months were an insane rollercoaster where I had to absorb an insane amount of information (eg. getting to know inhouse backend and frontend frameworks, D365 CE in's en out's, Power Platform, Azure services, DevOps...). During those first few months I mainly gained experience during the onboarding process (internal and external training), acquiring PL-100 and PL-400 certificates, performing technical work related to D365 projects in final build or existing support mode etc.

In May 2021 it got more exciting as I got the opportunity to work on an entirely new and big project where the technical lead and myself were the only ones being assigned to perform the technical implementation/customization from scratch. Although having to set up everything from scratch was very exciting as I had only worked on existing projects until now, unfortunately this project never really got up to speed. Decisions on our client's side took ages and even though there should've been enough technical work for 3-3.5 days/week, I barely managed to fill 2 days/week for this particular project. To fill up the week I again had to rely on performing support or optimalisations for already existing projects, with some research every now and then. In September 2021 an internal audit at our client even resulted in the project being put on hold for an undetermined amount of time. This obviously resulted in my agenda being filled up entirely with external and internal support projects and optimalisations, until now.

&amp;#x200B;

**My current situation**

If I tell you that I'm in my 20's, very ambitious and (sometimes too) skeptical about everything I spend my time on, you probably start thinking the story above is not ideal to give me enough fulfilment. Although my job title officially states 'Software Engineer', I really don't feel like I've been 'engineering' a lot of advanced software at all during the last 6 months even though I've gotten a lot more responsibilities. Obviously this has to do with gaining more experience and everyday tasks becoming part of your comfort zone. During this 1st year I've written hundreds of plug-ins, custom Actions, custom API's, extended/optimized our frontend Javascript framework, worked with Power Platform and solutions ALM, Azure Webjobs, Service Busses etc. But as the weeks progress I'm feeling more and more like a configurator than an actual developer/engineer...

The problem right now is that I'm trying to identify what's causing this lack of fulfilment and what my next step should be. As fortune telling from a glass sphere is still pretty unreliant today I'd like to reach out to you guys who might've been in the same situation or have (brutally honest) opinions ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**My concerns**

* I'm aware working as an employee at my current company results in my team and I having to rely on clients with a support contract or acquiring new clients/projects to be able to perform actual technical work. However, looking at my current weekly agenda and the current state of the sales pipeline, this doesn't bode very well for a future change of the situation. A logical move would be to look for another company within the same role, but that brings me to my next concern.
* Everybody knows 99% of the time during an application process people of HR and Business will try to sugarcoat whatever you're looking for in a company. I've been in some non-binding conversations with other companies and obviously they all have ""big and very exciting projects"". Assuming this might be true, this sparkles the following thought: will another technical D365 CE software engineering job be sufficient to support my technical growth?
* Although I'm sufficiently self-aware to realize I still have a lot to learn regarding Power Platform / D365 Development, it feels like all the ""hard work"" is already done for you and you're somewhat trapped in the D365 ""cage"". A big part of the job consists of getting to know all the in's &amp; out's, quirks, out-of-the (sometimes black) box processes MS provides and finding a way to deal with them. This particular feeling might be caused by the lack of projects or how solutions are designed and build at my current company, but I'm also thinking about potentially leaving this ""cage"" and start looking for more general software engineering jobs to get more experience with .NET Development, frontend JS frameworks, databases, design patterns...

In the end, this post quickly grew out of the proportions I initially had in mind. But I feel like the entire scope is required to fully understand my current situation. I'm really looking forward to some of your feedback and at the same time hope to maybe inspire other fellow juniors! :)",cscareerquestions,1636638355

4,Senior who had previously left the company left us with a mess of code with no comments or documentation.,"I am now working in a startup company, and the main project of the company had always been handled by my senior.

Then he left without a long notice period, like only 1 or 2 weeks. Within those weeks, he managed to create a very general documentation (high level view) that only describe the flow of the project.

Now I took over his task to migrate from iOS mobile app to MacOS desktop app. But looking at his code really killed my motivation, a lot of unused code was commented, yet there are no useful comments to describe his code.

I feel like my passion is degrading while working on this project and keep delaying my tasks. But at the same time, when my other Flutter project has something that needs improvement, I am relatively more motivated to work on my task.

I now feel very helpless because of the thought that in the future I will have to constantly face the messy code of my senior.",cscareerquestions,1636636272
5,Career stability of Compiler Developer jobs vs Network Developer jobs?,"I am a 4th year engineering student in Canada, and I am trying to decide between 2 full-time offers and I am feeling a little lost. Any advice or insight would be appreciated! For background, I have gotten a few internships in embedded development and an interest in real-time systems. I like that work but I also am early in my career and open to pursuing other fields of software development later on, depending on the interest and salary and stability of those fields.

Job 1 is an entry level network developer position at a recognizable name in Ottawa, Canada. The job is mostly C development (and usually python for tools/scripting) and the domain of the team is the routing and forwarding information bases for all networking device products that the company produces. It involves writing code in the company's proprietary RTOS.

Job 2 is a junior compiler developer for a recognizable name in Markham, Canada. It involves coding and maintaining the common code of a few back-end optimizing compilers. The compiler is proprietary, and compiles a few of the company's internal languages (and cobol), though our section of the code only deals with the intermediate representation of that code and generates the final optimized binaries.

Both jobs pay the same (just shy of 100k CAD/year, feel free to comment on what you think of that salary for a new grad in Canada also), and I could see myself being happy with both jobs. I am interested in both networking and compilers, although I will have taken two networking courses and zero (not by choice) compilers courses by the time I graduate. The locations are both good for me, too, since I have personal connections to both Toronto and Ottawa.

In particular I am curious what people think of the long-term stability of each field? Or transferrable skills, etc, of each job. I don't want to get stuck holding the bag with few transferrable skills a few years down the line. If you had to choose one of these jobs to start your career in 2021, which would it be and why?

Thanks very much!",cscareerquestions,1636636128
6,Looking for career advice,"I’ve been working as a software developer over 12 years and currently based in Sydney.  I’ve been in a lead capacity for half of that but I decided recently to take a new job as an individual contributor (sr software engineer). I am really enjoying the opportunity to concentrate purely on coding, but at the same time I feel like I have so much more experience to offer which is not being fully utilised in my current role.  I’m considering what I want to do for the rest of my career.

I’ve worked in 4 companies, including startups and also larger companies but not like FANG or the Atlassians or Canvas. I always wondered what all other companies are like working at, big or small. 

Having taken on this new role has also helped me realised what is important to me. Working with like minded talent who are passionate about coding, good company culture (not just frills), and a degree of autonomy so that I can be efficient.

7,Over 40 career change? Introverts? Anyone?,"Hello all:

I'm, ahem, over 40 and should be finishing up a BS in Software Development in May through WGU.  

I worked for 20 years in the healthcare field, then did my own thing here and there for a few years (reselling, consulting, even delivered for Amazon briefly).  

Now, I'm finally getting around to finishing that Bachelor's!  (I never finished before due to being unable to pick a major).

Originally, I felt pretty confident about my prospects...then I came here and I'm overwhelmed and intimidated.   21 year olds starting out at $185+K, people with multiple internships...high level interviews...projects, portfolios...oh my.

And everyone here seems to be under 30, or if they are over 30, they're high-ranking and paid very, very well.

I don't even know what I want to specialize in, or field I want to work in later on. 

I don't need a FAANG career...  All I really want is to eventually land a decent paying, remote position, where I can do my work, get paid, the end...and I'm willing to wait for the right opportunity...but do they exist...for me?

I'm a mom and quite an introvert and at this point, I've decided to lean into my limits and personality traits instead of fighting them anymore.  My strengths are that I'm smart, organized and can learn things easily.  

But after reading through this sub I'm now doubting everything.

TLDR:

Sorry this is a bit all over the place; my questions are:

1.  Any career changers over 40?  Can you share your story?
2. Are there remote jobs for a BSSW grad where you can just...do the work and get paid?
3. Is anyone else overwhelmed here?
4. Any suggestions on a field where you are likely to be able to be remote and just log in, do work, go home?
5. Any tips, thoughts?

8,Am I being dragged along?,"A recruiter reached out about a job that I thought sounded interesting about 2 months ago and I've been interviewing since. After the tech screen and the Hiring Manager interview, they thought I wouldn't be a good fit for that specific role but had a new posting coming along and they thought I would be a great fit there. I wouldn't need to do any of the screening again, just join at the final portion of the interview process.

So I waited a few weeks for the new role to be posted internally then externally. I did the final round of interviews and had a pretty good time. I talked with the recruiter after the day is over and she says that they have a diverse talent hiring pipeline and need to interview a certain number of diverse candidates before they can make an offer (I'm a white male)... Since I was the first to go, it'll be a few weeks minimum.

Two days later, I have the recruiter wanting to set up a phone call with me. They said that the interview panel unanimously agreed that they should hire me, but they have to get through the pipeline first. It also sounds like there's a new role opening up at the same level, in the same department, but on another team. The hiring manager thinks I would also be a good fit there as well. Essentially, it sounds like they want to hire me but can't at the moment and can't guarantee anything because they still have to interview a certain number of candidates.

All of the glassdoor reviews about his company's hiring process are great, so I don't think they are trying to screw me over somehow. But I'm curious to know if anyone has been in a similar situation? Do you think the company is just stringing me a long?

10,Reaching recruiter after one week from first contact,"Hi,

Last week a recruiter from a company I'm interested in reached out to me and said my profile was a fit for a backend role that she had for this company.

It could've been one of those many cases where a recruiter reaches out with opportunity that has nothing to do with your actual experience, but that wasn't the case. From past job offers that I've seen from that company, I know that I'm a pretty good fit in terms of tech stack and values. Also, a guy who used to work with me , and with who I have a very good relationship, moved to this company 6 months ago and now agrees that I'd be a perfect fit for the role. So, I'm pretty confident that my experience would be valuable for this company.

The thing is that I had a call on Thursday, last week, with the recruiter about the position and it went pretty well. I think that it was clear that my experience was pretty well aligned with what this company is looking for. We talked a bit about the company, the interview process, as well as about my previous experience and motivation to move on. Finally, the recruiter gave me positive feedback about the call, and said that she'd pass my profile on to the actual team following Friday (6 days ago) and that I'd have news the following week.

It's been 7 days from that call and 6 days from the day she passed my resume on to the team, but I haven't had any news yet.

What should I do about it? Should I reach the recruiter politely and ask for an update?  I'm not feeling like letting the time pass and ""see what happens"" since I'm on vacation for 2 weeks so it would be a perfect moment to start the actual interview process. Also I'm very interested in this company and role, so I want to make sure that I'm not ghosted. If I'm going to be rejected even before the interview process starts, I'd like to know why since it was apparently pretty clear that I was a fit, so agreed the recruiter.

What would be the best way to approach this situation?

About a week  later, I got an email from them- this is the link: [https://imgur.com/a/Pqgd4wr](https://imgur.com/a/Pqgd4wr)

Notice  how the interview is short? I thought that was unusual for a company  because I never heard of an interview lasting only twenty minutes for  any job, especially for a position that's software related.  What was  even weirder was that even though they had a main website, they had next to no other online presence.  No LinkedIn profile, and no Glassdoor  account.  The only thing I could find was their Indeed profile that had  just one job review written back in 2017.  Nevertheless, I still  followed their instructions and filled out the rest of their application  (they asked me a bunch of personality questions and had me do a timed cognitive assessment).  Then, I scheduled for the interview on Wednesday  (today).

Flash forward to today,  and during the interview, I saw two guys were hosting the Zoom call.   One guy was part of HR, and the other guy did most of the talking.  The  guy who asked the questions seemed, for a lack of better terms,  unprepared and standoffish.  For the first 5 or 10 minutes of the call,  his eyes were glued to the screen reading something off (my guess was  that he was reading some pre-written questions) and asked when I  graduated even though I submitted my resume telling exactly when I  graduated.  He emphasized that I had a lot of work to pick up since I  was not used to their technology stack (it's PHP and Laravel).  When I  gave a lowball salary (since my only other work experience was not directly in software) he said he wanted to give me a lower salary for now since he  wants to know if I have the ability"" to pick up the frameworks quickly  enough, and then give me the salary I suggested. Another thing that he  mentioned that there were only three other members in the company that  were working on the tech stack, and that I would be the fourth.

Although  the company was very small (it apparently has less than 50 employees) I  thought it was very strange that there are only three individuals  working on the tech stack of the whole company, considering it seemed to  be a tech oriented firm.  Then he picked up the phone during the middle  of the interview and called one of their employees over.  When that guy  came, he just asked one or two questions on when I used Vue.js and how  big the project I have worked on previously were.  And that was it- they  never asked me a single coding question from Leetcode or Hackerrank.   Then the main guy came back and because it seemed that I ""was smart  enough"", he basically **hired me on the spot** and asked me when I could come.

Naturally,  because everything just seemed a little off, I got to ask some of my  questions, one of which was the company culture.  I remember that the  main guy gave a very vague answer on how it's centered on work and  collaboration.  I also found that to be strange since it seems that most  other firms seems to have a central motto on work or have a ""quirk"" in  them.

I just find the whole  experience very uneasy because I never had or heard of an interview that  lasted this short, nor did they even follow typical interview  guidelines you would normally see at other companies- everything seemed a  little impromptu.  In fact, when I asked the HR guy when I am going to  get the job offer letter in writing, he said that I am going to get it  tomorrow.  So here I am just confused as hell.  What do you  guys, especially you guys who work as software developers, think? What  in the world is going on here?",cscareerquestions,1636614260

41,Ontario teacher looking into switching to programming,"Hi everyone,

You probably get many questions like this, so I apologize if it's repetitive! I am 27 years old, and currently in my second year of teaching in a public school setting in Ontario. I quickly learned that this field isn't for me, and I'm looking into making a career switch into the tech industry. I don't have any experience in computer science or anything tech-related, but I'm really interested to learn, and to see if it's something for me. My educational background includes 2 humanities-related honours bachelor degrees, and 1 education-related master's degree (8 years total in university). 

I have a few questions in regards to this, and would really appreciate if anyone can provide any advice/words of wisdom:

1. How can I determine if the tech industry is right for me, as well as which department suits me best (e.g. comp programmer, software developer, UX/UI design, etc.)?
2. Any advice on making the switch/starting from scratch?
3. Are boot camps worth it, and if so, which ones are the most reputable/recommended?
4. Is it necessary to get a diploma/degree from a college/university to get into a well-paid field in the tech industry? If not, what can I do to increase my knowledge and skillset to make me ""hire-able""?
5. Would it be worth my time applying to Shopify's (incredibly competitive) DevDegree program? 
6. In relation to #5, are there any other similar programs/internships?

45,What helped me massively with all sorts of ailments from my 10 year programming career," 

Biggest thing that helped me my hand pain was these cheap ass gloves from amazon: [https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08PKL8GQY/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o03\_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08PKL8GQY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Not only do they keep my hands warmer but there's also a cushion between your fingers and the keyboard keys. Also one of the worst things I ever did to my hands was cheaping out on keyboards, I always buy premium keyboards nowadays and that helps loads too. Also keeping your hands warm when you're outside with some premium/expensive warm gloves help lots too, if you've got poor circulation like I do and coming home with your hands stiff from the cold the last thing you want to do is smash keys for 10 hours.

One thing that helped me immensely with wrist, shoulder, neck and back pain was a Herman Miller chair, they are definitely expensive but they have been 110% worth it for me, to me they are a no-brainer and I regret not buying one earlier than I did. I used to have one of those racer gaming chairs and they completely destroyed most of my upper body but since switching to a Herman Miller ergonomic chair I've had no wrist pain at all, no shoulder pain at all, no neck pain whatsoever. I have slight back pain still but it's been helped immensely by the chair.

49,Internship Choice question,"Hi everyone,

new reddit user-- literally created the account to ask this question. I am deciding between two internships and would love to hear everyone's thoughts &amp; advice, esp if you have experience in cybersecurity/transitioning from software development to security. 

about me: My plan is to transition from software to security at \*some\* point in my career, but I am really not sure about a few things:

1. Seems like sound dev skills are highly valued in the security space and the rest can be picked up on the job, so is it better to get a few years of experience in the industry before transitioning? I know this is only an internship, but I am a current junior and wants to have a solid game plan before graduation
2. I've worked at startups before and would love to experience a larger company, but not sure if the tradeoff is worth it
3. Thinking about grad school in computer systems/network, so there def might be more internships in the future. Not sure if the clout/higher pay from CompanyA is worth it, but it certainly is enticing 

I'm very obviously overanalyzing a bit but would love to use this as a way to learn more about the industry + any recommendations/thoughts! Looking to be informed and convinced :)

Here is the comparison chart:

|salary|very high|not so high|
|location|ideal|so-so|
|skills|will prob improve primarily on programming skills (but a bit worried about lack of guidance/direction)|will prob learn a lot about SDR and incident response, but may not program as much. A bit worried about contribution/impact|
|gut feeling|will prob impress my family &amp; friends, maybe a career boost? but might miss the opportunity to explore an area I'm more interested in |will prob be more satisfying, but might miss the opportunity for a career boost &amp; catch better opportunities in the security space later on|",cscareerquestions,1636604989

51,Red Flags for a Staffing firm?,"I one day when feeling bad about my ridiculously bad compensation and poor outlook for getting a raise decided to update my resume and just... see what's out there. I wasn't very popular last year when I had only a degree and no experience. I've got almost 6 months experience now and the job shortage is even worse, so maybe something will happen. At the very least, boost my ego. I go ahead and fill out a single indeed application. the next morning, not 12 hours later, I have a phone call from the company I applied to. It was literally the first job on indeed. I wasn't REALLY considering switching, at least until my work refused my raise. But I entertained it. 

It was an american man (I'm sorry to sound prejudice, I understand that indian people make up a gigantic part of the tech world, but i get 200 emails a day from indian startups, so even if its incorrect, american recruiters give me some sense of legitimacy) and he said his staffing firm is currently staffing for a large famous pharmaceutical company. 

Before I go further, I want to say that this staffing firm is Called StarsHr. I cannot find ANY real reviews about them other than their own website and socials. I see there's an entry for them on the BBB but its not filled out. 

The large pharmaceutical company bought a smaller medical company some years back thats about 10 miles from where I live (I looked it up and that is correct). They are staffing software developers to help with ""automated dye injection tech"" whatever that means. Speaking to the recruiter, things went well, and he said he would be sending me some emails. 

I got the emails, the staffing firm would be my employer, the contract is 1 year but that this particular client almost always hired people on. It offers benefits (maybe SLIGHTLY worse than my current ones, but acceptable, including dental). Most importantly, he asked how much I hoped to make. I probably would have told him a better number, but I at the time wasn't really considering the offer. I said I have to make more than 65k. To which he was very surprised I was making less than that currently (lol). 

He said that he had to have me fill out of letter of exclusivity per this client's rules (the pharmaceutical company, not the staffing company). It was a standard boiler plate guidant global letter of exclusivity. I read the whole thing every word, its scope is only for this one company, and only for the one position ID (i made sure to check out the listing on guidant global and the position is real. I know scammers often find real positions, but at the very least its a real position). 

I had never done a letter of exclusivity before, and I looked it up. apparently a lot of employers who use staffing companies do it so that they don't have the same candidate applying to the same position from like 15 agencies. 

He emailed me today asking if I could do an interview on friday. I said sure, what kind of interview? Technical with coding/whiteboarding or a behavior interview. He said it would be with their hiring manager (who's name he gave me, I looked up him, he's on linked in as someone working for that pharmaceutical company) and would be just basic ones about my qualifications, then later we would do a MS teams interview with a panel and some coding. 

He emailed me a few hours later to say he was mistaken, they're going to forego the phone screening and behavior part and its going to be the MS teams meeting on friday. Panel of 4. The hiring manager, his team lead, and people on the team who were previously from the same staffing company but are now full time there. 

He said the staffing company president wants to talk to me tomorrow on the phone and give me a ""more detailed pre-interview briefing"". That... was weird to me. 

So for starters, does anything jump out at you. Anything look like a red flag. Second, if not, what red flags should I look out for? Anything I definitely should never do or ever sign? And lastly, have you EVER heard of starsHR? All the people named have linkedin accounts with robust activity, hundreds of connections at real companies, several endorsements.

58,Senior dev on our team keeps trying to push QA onto devs,"Lately, one of our devs has been advocating we help our dedicated QA team (every team has 2 dedicated QAs to the 5-6 devs). The expectation is we are assigned our own work full stories, need to shift to do QA for who knows what, then shift back to our work. 

At first, we helped where we could but it became more and more. We're given one days worth of time to test features/products manually because supposedly the QAs themselves do the rest, but now senior dev person wants us to write full suites of test cases too... so other devs said no or else give us more time to understand requirements/get domain knowledge? Dev person was quiet during this.

The convo w/SM leads to this not being a good use of our time because most devs are testing out of or lack domain/requirement knowledge where the QAs spend a good portion of their time understanding business requirements/needs etc. across the multiple products. The QA themselves have been silent for the most part of this ordeal too.

We're supposed to have a meeting next week to discuss this as a team, all the devs except the one openly expressed this is not productive to have devs  to do guess work on testing.

Just trying to get some opinions, anyone have this happen before? If we were full stack or everyone had to do this for their own work? I don't think this would be an issue.

They are currently in series A, valued at $60M, and plan to raise a series B at $200-300M valuation. Startup is a pure tech play, with about 2 M in ARR atm. Annual subscription basis. Backed by top VCs and execs in many of the tech firms we see today.

The other offer is a safer option (larger entity) and has both good engineering growth and annual salary progression. However, it has already matured and does not have the same excitement a start-up brings.

1. **Online job listings are a godsend.** While it says “job listing,” a lot of companies also look for interns via these websites.

[**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=Programming%20Intern&amp;location=United%20States&amp;geoId=103644278&amp;trk=public_jobs_jobs-search-bar_search-submit&amp;position=1&amp;pageNum=0). Being a professional hub, LinkedIn proved to be reliable to me. They have Easy Apply, so if you have a LinkedIn profile/resume set up, you can just apply in a few clicks. 
   3. [**Indeed**](https://www.indeed.com/q-Computer-Programming-Intern-jobs.html?vjk=c4ecdb0c2bf88de6)**.** I recently realized that they also have a lot of programming/CS internship roles open too. 
2. **Put your game face on.** And this is quite literally. One thing my professor told me that stuck with me is that professional life in CS is sorta like coding - problems are mostly solved when thinking outside the box. I realized this is the same when finding internships. Don’t hesitate to skip the textbook method of just waiting for emails and get yourself out there.
   1. Get ready to talk to a lot of people. I forced myself to get over my social anxiety if it meant trying to establish new connections in this 3 week period. I managed to talk to people I would never talk to unless needed. These included strangers like security personnel, front desk employees, professors, and even professionals I reached out to.
   2. Everything has a connection. Since you’re looking for a company that might look for CS internships, try to look for places nearby where your target companies might have a presence. 
   3. Go straight for the gold. If you discover a contact to a company via a job listing or announcements, don’t hesitate to reach out to them directly regarding internships. 
3. **Check your uni’s database.** It’s impossible for your uni or school not to have connections with other unis or companies related to CS, especially for your department. I discovered some companies to apply to by looking into:
   1. Try to check any recent seminars or conferences that a company held in your school. Chances are, your department officials might know how to reach out to the contact person there.
   2. Try to ask your professors if they have any connections regarding companies that might be interested in internships. This might be a shortcut, but it’s still worth the ask, right?
   3. Try to check what other universities are doing. Try to follow the above steps but with other schools. I discovered a handful of companies that did some talks in other schools nearby so I tried reaching out to them as well.
4. **Prepare the paperwork anyway.** It’s very likely that your internship will be remote. My internship will be remote. But one thing I did to be sure is to print out everything I’ve sent to the companies when applying. These include my CVs and cover letters and other requirements your school might need you to submit. Always have some thumb drives ready with some projects you can show interviewers. Relevant for the next stage.
5. **Personal visits still work.** If you’ve seen companies that offer internships that are nearby, don’t hesitate to make a visit. Remember, when you do, bring any COVID safety requirements if ready. This is important for the sake of anxiety, as you’ll want to make sure that your CV and cover letter reaches an actual person’s hands. Some pointers when visiting companies to give out your CVs/cover letters:
   1. Prepare an itinerary when visiting multiple places. If you’re commuting, it helps to have at least a proper sequence of companies to visit so you don’t get too stressed with your trip. The more companies you visit in a single visit, the better. 
   2. Ask for a contact person, be it an email or a mobile number. This lets you know who you’ll be expecting an email from.
6. **Prepare to settle.** Since I’m rushing the process, I removed any semblance of being able to choose where I get my internship. I can’t afford to choose when I’m focusing on getting one as soon as possible, so when the opportunity came, I took it and now I’m hoping for the best. I do have plans of taking another internship next year of my own accord, since I ended up in a telcomms and I really want to pursue gaming. 

I hope these tips help. I can’t share where I’ll be working because of an NDA. If you have other tips, please include them as well so we can help each other out. Thanks",cscareerquestions,1636589030

86,[New Grad] How much am I stunting my growth and how soon should I leave?,"Hi all. I’m a recent comp sci grad from a large state university. I’ve been working for a company that I love - but I don’t feel like I’m doing any “real” development. 

I primarily work on ServiceNow, an application platform as a service that’s moving further towards low code, so while I do a lot of scripting and “application development”, I know that I’m not being exposed to the processes that would lead one to be qualified for more experienced software dev jobs outside of this particular platform. 

I am learning problem solving, agile, and translating business needs, so it’s like this is a complete waste of time, but when I develop an API I’m largely relying on their prebuilt tools to do the heavy lifting (as opposed to making a true backend with flask, etc.). 

Here’s my question: is 6 months too soon to begin looking for more traditional full stack junior web development type jobs? My current thought is that if I only want to do this for 2 years and transition to a more typical software dev role, the sooner the better, right?

The projects I have on my resume are ones that I am incredibly proud of, but mostly related to games. I have little outside perspective on the quality of my work but I think I've done some novel things. I made a jigsaw puzzle game ([Jgsw](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627610/Jgsw/) on Steam) with custom shaders for rendering 5000+ detailed pieces with online multiplayer. I made a dithering post process tool ([QuickDither](https://github.com/Ooseykins/QuickDither) on GitHub) that leverages compute shaders to generate lookup textures. I started a trend for other vtuber software ([VtubeReflect](https://oose.itch.io/vtubereflect) on itch) that became a kind of minor sensation on twitter.

96,did I misrepresent myself to the recruiter?," I am currently a college student. This week, I have received an internship offer from this unnamed company.

So a little background: this internship posting has, as a basic requirement, ""needs at least x years of college"". When I first applied, I think I misunderstood the posting as ""by the start of this internship, you must have at least x yrs of college"".

Well, I'm graduating a year early and I have previously done approximately a year's worth of dual enrollment courses in the college I am currently attending. I also was wary of being rejected due to this, since in a different interview with a different company, I got rejected in the \*middle of an interview\* because the recruiter thought I didn't have enough schooling experience yet (as a result, I pretty much tried to avoid saying anything that suggested I wasn't actually a x-year).

But looking back, I think it meant \*this\* current year. I am a year below what they are requesting. Like I do believe I have the most of qualifications as detailed on the job description, aside from the fact that I am not a x-year or above. Nothing on my resume is misrepresented. I am actually graduating a year early, and my colleges classes are x-level. 

But now I'm really really scared that this might get revoked because of this detail I did not disclose (this is the only offer I'm getting, and my resume honestly sucks, and I've been completely ghosted by practically everywhere else I've applied).

I received a very small increase after my first anniversary, but I haven’t heard anything since my most recent anniversary. The reason might be that I moved to a new team and role 2 months ago, and the last 4 weeks (overlapping my anniversary) I have been taking Guidewire classes.

My question is: should I ask for a raise? I’m incredibly new to this environment and the language. Also, I did not seek out the change, but was instead ‘selected’. I am aware that we are offering external candidates with little to no experience significantly more compensation than I am currently receiving. While I am excited for this new opportunity and I’m more than willing to put in the time and effort to become adept at it, I’d be lying if I didn’t say the lack of comparable compensation isn’t weighing on my mind.

5,Need Guidance - My struggle with Back-End Web Development and Improving,"I'm give up fellas! I don't know how its just not sticking to my brain but I'm struggling, always lost and annoying my coworkers with the constant hand-holding'. I'm feeling like I'm not cut out for this work and fooling myself. My question is how did you guys learn to be competent developers in the Back-End web dev? Also, what is your process in learning new concepts, integrations and technology stacks in a fast pace environment? I'm always clueless and petrified when something new is expected for me to complete when I have no prior experience to it.  


My company's focus is eCommerce and consultancy which includes development support work with other companies. I been working in BED for more than 3 years here and most of my experience has been working on CMS technology like AEM, working with .NET Web APIs and extensions for PIM systems. Despite all this, my skill set and knowledge feels more entry-level than junior developer. Each project I get transferred always has something new I never worked with and expected to implement alone and quickly. For example, I never worked with Middleware such as Boomi and how to set it up, I don't know how to create and utilize WSDL to work with SOAP, I don't know what Intershop is and have time to learn to work with it. Clueless in determining which web services is the best option for the task. The client's IT team explains the work criteria and then provide me an endpoint, and then it's up to me to make sense of something I feel is like walking in the dark.   


I feel like the root of the issues are: 

* I don't know what questions to ask and what is expected of me to already know
* I don't know if I have everything I need when the work is presented, this goes in hand with the first bullet point
* Not sure if I am cut out for this type of work, the overhead of incorporating new services and stacks is too complex and overbearing to understand
* I never know where to begin! I love programming, manipulating data and solving complex problems, but I have clearer understanding on what I need to do on that level

9,Should I look for software engineering positions for the Spring 2022?,"Here's my backstory. Due to what I found to be a competitive salary for an entry level software engineering position, I accepted a return offer that will take place starting July 2022. Around that time, I expected to do an accelerated masters program (in computer science obvs ;) ), where I would start my graduate courses in Spring of 2022, and after Fall 2021 finishes I'll completely fulfill my undergraduate requirements.

I had quite some time to ruminate on how the hell will I have a work-life balance if I'm juggling a full time job and full time graduate studies (required for the accelerated masters program), and ultimately decided that the program is not for me.

So that means I won't be taking any classes in Spring 2022, but my bachelors degree won't be conferred until the end of that semester since I had applied to graduate for that time (since it was required by the accelerated masters program to complete some graduate courses before conferral of bachelors degree).

More importantly, this means that I have a lot of spare time for Spring 2022 and I'd like to work in a position, ideally a computer programming/ software engineering position, in the time before July to not be bored and get some money rolling. I'm just unsure about whether I should look for positions because 1.) I'm not sure if I'll have enough time from now to then to get a position starting January; and 2.) I'm not sure about whether it'd look good or hurt my professional reputation to intentionally take a role only to quit it months later. 

I'd really like to know your thoughts and use them as potential guidance.

32,"Struggling to cope and work with my manager at a ""start-up""","For the last 6 months since graduating from college I have been working at a small tech company on a new company project and team which very closely resembles that of a new start-up. Our team is very small and only consists of 3 devs, 1 tester/QA and my manager. All 3 devs (myself included) were all hired together fresh out of college and we started at the same time. 

My experience so far has been pretty positive. The company treats us well, we're paid a decent salary and it's been fun learning and working with new exciting technologies in a fairly relaxed work environment. 

However, after 6 months I've really started to grow to hate and struggle with my manager. This is his first ever management role, and personally I feel like that has reflected on his conduct and overall management of our project. The guy is a complete workaholic. He works non-stop to get things done and has absolutely no concept of the working day coming to an end or having free time after work or the weekends. He plays down the idea of doing unpaid overtime constantly, as if it's normal and we should always be doing it, and also never says no to the demands of the management team - no matter how unrealistic or unreasonable. As a result, the scope of our project has completely spiraled out of control, we've missed our first major deadline and now we're under pressure to meet the next deadline. 

I cannot stand working with a manager who is constantly expecting me to value my work more than my own life and health. For example, he previously got very angry and shouted at me after I told him that I didn't have time to go back and pick up an extremely minor task (as I was working on developing more important features assigned to me by him) - because according to him ""no time"" is not an acceptable answer - as we always have time. By this he is meaning I should have went home one evening and picked up that task or done it over the weekend on my own accord. He has no concept of the working day coming to an end and leaving your work at the door. 

Another example of this involves annual leave. If you book a holiday, no matter how far in advance, he pretty much always moans about it come the time actually take your holiday. As a result of his poor planning and time management he will approve the holidays, and then try to get myself and others to cancel them the week before. If you cancel them for him - he loves you, if you don't - you are pretty much treated like a criminal in the office until it blows over. 

Is this kind of behavior normal in this industry? I always knew there would be stressful times approaching deadlines where extra work might need to be put in to get things done, and was accepting/willing to do this upon reasonable request - but I really don't feel like it should be constant or that he should expect it from us rather than respectfully asking for a favor. If I knew more about him prior I definitely wouldn't have taken the job. Now I'm counting down the time until I've gained enough experience, hopefully next year, to move on to a better position at a bigger company where working conditions are better. 

I would appreciate any advice or comments anyone has for me on what I should do or how to cope with this kind of manager.",cscareerquestions,1636575808

I’ve only worked at one other company before (I’m early career) but i know that the software structure of the app could be vastly improved: there is almost no dependency injection of services (hard instantiations everywhere), huge classes that do multiple things, and a lot of business logic happening in Model classes. 


I asked him why he doesn’t use the service classes to hold the model business logic he’s trying to do and he kept explaining his case as to why he needs to use it in the model class which still doesn’t make sense to me.


I disagree with how the code is being structured right now, and it’s obviously a bitch to test, but i don’t know how to explain that to my senior developer effectively. The code ‘works’ but it’s not structured the most efficiently and it’s almost impossible to test well.

39,Evaluating different competitive offers for internship (finance and tech),"Hello, I am fortunate to have three good internship offers and I am looking for opinions on evaluating these offers.

1. Major US tech company for a ML/DS position (one of FB/APPLE/GOOGLE/MSFT/AMAZON). 
2. Major US Investment Bank for a quantitative finance position (one of JPM, GS, MS).
3. Proprietary Trading Firm that is not as well known for a quantitative position (One of Virtu, Optiver, SIG, Schonfeld, IMC)

For context I am a phd student from a big us university in a stem field. I have an interest in finance but also tech companies sound interesting. This is a first and potentially last internship for me so I want to make it count. Getting a return offer is nice but not a major consideration. 

In terms of compensation, the order is 1&lt;2&lt;&lt;3. However this is only an internship so I don't think this should be the primary consideration (although the compensation would still change my net worth considerably %-wise since I am a student). Benefits are also slightly better from 3 but other offers are competitive.

Since I don't have internship experience, I am looking for factors to look at for evaluating these offers. The companies in 3 are not as well known in general. I think all three internships are gonna be high quality. I have received more attention from 2 and 3. 1 is probably more indifferent as to if I join or not (which is logical as it is a huge organization).

Factors that count are: resume impact (getting interviews in the future with ease), stability, salary evolution in areas, growth/learning.

Anyways, I joined about a month ago and been learning the stack little by little. They do React/TS for the frontend, and use Kotlin/Ktor for Backend, and GCP.

I'm pretty good at frontend stuff and React, but I never really got around to properly learning backend, and I never even touched Java or Kotlin. The tasks involving lots of backend are getting a bit hairy and I feel bad for asking my seniors too many questions when I know they're busy.

My question is, what advice do you have for new-grad (or not) SE's joining a new company, using a new stack?

Perhaps taking notes when learning something new? Reading other's PRs on GitHub and noting down the style and how they implement issues? (Maybe note down stuff with MD)

Studying while on company time?

Do you maybe have some books or courses specifically for my current stack that you can suggest?

I'm considering going to undergrad for CS and had questions about remote work positions. My older brother and friends who are already established in the field work much less than the usual ~40 hours a week that I see people say in ""How much do you work"" threads. Is this common in remote environments? From my understanding, it seems that they only work as much as they need to finish their tickets and projects, and then go on about their lives. Sometimes they'll hit 7-8 hours, but most of the time, it seems more like 4-5. Is this something I can expect for a career in CS or am I looking at a biased sample? 

Questions I may be asked: 

Are you interested in CS? 
-Truthfully, there's nothing I've found that I'm interested enough in that I would want to do as a career, but I need to do something with your life. 

Have you tried career counseling?
-I have. Nothing has particularly piques my interest so I'd like to do something that lets me focus on myself and hobbies. CS is the main contender because I feel it will let me work less based on what I've seen. 

Would you be happy in CS if you had to work a typical 40 hour work week or more? 
-Most likely not. Most, but not all, of the appeal is the prospect of working less and having more time to myself.

50,Tentative offer after failing LC challenge.,"Hi everyone.

So, for a little backstory, I’m a Software Engineer with about 10 years of experience. But only 4 are corporate work. The rest is in freelancing and contract work. Most of it in the .Net stack.

Recently (3 weeks or so), I decided to go back to corporate work and started applying for jobs.

One of the companies I applied to was a mid-sized, well established company. They did the pre screening and I have 2 technical interviews afterward.

The first interview started with basic questions ( describe a project you are proud of ), then a little of system design and finally a LC challenge.

I was average all around during the interview and failed the LC ( only about 80% of the test cases were correct )

The second tech interview was just system design. I think I did well for most of it. I had a good grasp of the concepts and applications.  But by the end, the interviewer started asking things I had no idea about.

I had no choice but to tell him I hadn’t heard of those technologies, ever before.

Fast forward to today, and I was extended a tentative offer ( I still have to go through a third interview with the technology lead before the official one ). 

It is not that great, at 10k a month, but the company works with many technologies, and I’m tempted to accept just so I can have hands-on experience with them.

I’m very confused right now, and don’t know what to expect from this fourth interview, or the job, honestly.

Anyway, TLDR: What just happened? I’m particularly interested in the insight of those who did interviews before. What would make you extend an offer for someone who failed in 2 interviews in a row?",cscareerquestions,1636571480

I'm not keen on this new company in general; they seem like they are just buying up every company they can to make a profit. There are also rumors that the executives fill top positions with friends or ex-colleagues.

One of the biggest differences between the startup I worked for and our acquirer is the way in which compensation is handled. I'm used to having my salary reviewed yearly, with a decent increase each year. Now I'm hearing that it could change to a 0.x% increase per year, if at all.

I've heard that one of the best ways to build up your income is to move jobs every few years, as you're more likely to get a bigger boost in pay and job title by moving than you are from a few years of salary reviews at the same company.

Hi All - 


Sorry for the long post but I'm at a loss and could use some advice / direction. Here is my story:

I graduated a finance major with no coding experience. I took a job in financial services at a large company and have been working there for the last 8 years (I’m 28). The first year at my job I was fed up with the manual processes I had to do all day long so I learned Visual Basic via Google and automated everything I could (outlook scripts, macros, etc). I loved this first year of figuring out how to build things and provide value to my team. Over the past 8 years I was promoted twice and my role has shifted to managing a 15 person team, running client calls and putting out fires. I didn’t pursue programming earlier simply because of the opportunities to climb the ladder in my current role and ultimately earn more money. I also felt that I was getting some valuable leadership experience and I enjoyed learning about leadership strategies and how to build / optimize my team. 

Things I enjoy:
- Problem Solving &amp; Critical Thinking
- Creating more efficient processes
- Business Strategy
- Web Design / layouts (I’m a perfectionist, if something is not symmetrical or is off a few pixels it drives me nuts)
- Leading small team
- Being “creative” (self taught all Adobe products – love Illustrator)

Things I don’t enjoy:
- Dealing with clients &amp; presenting (I’m introverted, I can do it but I really would prefer not to regularly)
- Sales, wining &amp; dining, socializing with anyone outside my team.


I’m jealous of the folks who get to go to work everyday and build things. I’ve lost the passion I once had for my current role and need to make a change. Over the last 2 years I’ve been working on passion projects at nights &amp; on weekends (on and off) to scratch that itch. I’ve learned basic HTML, CSS, React, Django via YouTube videos and enjoy creating websites and figuring out how to pull info from APIs. Part of me says a combo of web dev and UI design makes the most sense but I really have no idea? Based on what I’ve noted above, does anyone have any suggestions as to what role might fit the best or what I should work towards? Or has anyone been in a similar situation?

Without naming any specific companies or sectors, I think many of us have a list in our head of companies that we would never work for purely on account of their business practices.

It's my belief that changing the culture in tech, to make it clear that certain unethical practices will not be tolerated, is something that has to start at a grassroots level. When I'm approached by a recruiter from one of these highly unethical companies, should I write them a polite note just explaining that I fundamentally disagree with the company's practices, and therefor I will not be applying now or at any point in the future?

I showed good leadership and took charges on planning/design, assigning tasks, etc (naturally anyone would since new hires doesn't know much, my performance review prior to that has been that I lack leadership skill so I tried to improve).

 Manager and his manager were impressed with the performance, told me they are working on a team lead position, which will be posted soon (end up taking months). I was confident at first, but recently there weren't much opportunity for me to display traits of team leads, I do still do my best to guide new hires and provide support (but it's something anyone can do, and it's given to help out newer hires, I have received help from more senior developers). 

This week the posting came and manager (who took part in creating the new job) told me to apply. I am not as confident as before and there are developers that has been with the company for longer, who has way more experience in the field. Even if I apply and get the job I am afraid people wont be happy with it. I don't see myself stood out as much as I did during that one project.

However This is a really good opportunity if I get the job, I can advance in my career. I have no team lead experience but I do think I can get better if I get the job. Anyone been in a similar situation? Any advices?

additional info:

I think my main motivation are:

1. A raise (but then I can most likely get a higher salary if I switch company)
2. I can grow as a person, I believe leadership skill can be applied to a lot of different aspect in life. And this is a rare opportunity for me to move up. If I miss this opportunity it might be harder later on if I want to move up.
3. Want to force myself out of my comfort zone, I've been getting lazy and too comfortable

Negative:

1. I'm not technical enough
2. I feel coworkers won't be happy if I do get the job (I have great relationship with them right now, at least I feel that way)
3. Afraid I wont be up to expectation. Unsure how stressful the job will be. He told me around 70% will be doing what I do now.",cscareerquestions,1636559111

Fellow data scientist, or those who work in the computer science industry, any input would be great.

So I graduated in May from UIUC with a BS in Statistics and I started applying like crazy to land a job as a data scientist as that is pretty much what I love to do. Very competitive as anyone else would agree but I ended landing a database manager position for a company in Chicago. Been here for about 4 months now and the role itself has been very unfulfilling. It took me so much to get permission to do machine learning projects (The current data scientist struggled with this, and this is what I am very good at). After a while I told myself that I would be much more happier being a data scientist, so I started applying again. I landed a interview for a pretty big Data science/AI company, had to three interviews with them total along with a technical portion requiring me to build a model. I got an offer finally as an entry level data scientist from them. The base salary is at 80K, and I requested 85k to be more comfortable with the transition. They said they would get back to me but most likely would only be able to go up to 82.5K. Is this reasonable for a starting data scientist position?

I’m currently casually job hunting, not in a hurry but I’m looking for somewhere new where I can grow a bit more. 

So I was on an initial phone screen with a company earlier this week and things were going really well. We got to the end and the recruiter asked “what are your salary expectations for this position?” So for some background, I haven’t interviewed in a long time, not since college, and frankly I never learned the unwritten “rules” of salary negotiation. Since that call I’ve looked up some suggestions on what you’re “supposed to” say to these types of questions (keep it vague, open. Give non-answers). What I actually said on the call was the actual amount it would take for me to leave, but I think I still lowballed myself. I currently work at a midsize non-tech company in the Midwest making a good clip under 6 figures, and frankly 6 figures was all I wanted when I started looking (COL living adjustments and all). 

Did I really mess up here? Assuming the rest of the interview process goes well (have since gotten through the second rounding coding interview and they said that went well) have I lost some leverage at the negotiation table if I get to that point?

I was so shocked that I forgot to negotiate for a higher salary over the phone and I feel like I'm getting low balled for my first ever CS career. They offered me 66k a year plus a 5k sign on bonus and a 12k retention bonus so after my first year I get 5k out of the 12k then after my second year I get the last 7k. Now I was shocked and didn't know what to say but my buddy said I still have time to negotiate over email since I haven't signed anything yet. Does that also seem low to anyone else and if you also agree, its not to late to negotiate over email, right? Also they wouldn't pull the offer bc I'm trying to negotiate right?

21,15 year old looking for job in CS?,"Hey, pretty simple. I am turning 15 legally allowed to get a job. Should I try to find a place where I can use my programming skills to further extend my knowledge and maybe make some more money than an average job (if so how should I go about this. Do I look for remote or in person?) or do I find a job a supermarket or alike.

I would say I am fairly experienced, I'll link my Gitlab, so you can see some of my projects. I have also contributed to some open source projects.

If I was looking to work in the CS field, I would probably be able to do a couple of hours a day, and would like the company to take a chance on me.

24,Persistent production failure - not feeling cut out for programming,"Hi r/cscareerquestions,

I’ve been experiencing a lot of failure in my first real programming job and am feeling more lost and unprepared than I ever have in school. For context: I’m a recent grad who just started a two year rotational program (using a throwaway account to hide my identity and the company identity), and I stepped up from random JIRA tickets to take  ownership of my first small project about six weeks ago. It started as a simple task to convert a csv file to an XML-like format and send it over FTP to a local server, and I pretty quickly hacked up a Docker container to run the conversion in our company’s larger data pipeline process - and it passed UAT environment testing so I felt good.

However, the first time I ran it in production, it ran into issues due to FTP stalling out in a way which I hadn’t prepared for, and production got held up - not a good look at all for a new hire to the company. Over the next two week sprint, I manually replicated the output of my program as a stopgap measure to avoid holding up the team, and I restructured the container to handle errors without holding up the pipeline. As before, I ran it in the UAT environment with no issues and prepared to move it to production, but once again it ran into completely different issues in the production environment and held up our pipeline automation process even more.

At this point, I’m entering week 7 of what should have been a two-week project, and am rapidly losing hope in my ability to either deliver on simple projects or program in any meaningful fashion. Is this normal for someone new to industry coding, or should I consider if this is not the right fit for me?",cscareerquestions,1636541535

28,No Senior Dev? Company lacks direction...,"So I'm a self-taught developer. Full stack but tend to focus on front end frameworks. In a previous life I was a Mechanical Engineer and pretty soon after taking a couple of months out this year to really get my software skills up to date I landed a job that combined my old skills with the new - exciting right?

Here is where the bad starts...

I was pretty specific when I joined that I was a beginner programmer. This was my first job in the field and I was really looking for somewhere I could learn more and learn quickly. Was promised by top to bottom at the company that this is the perfect place.

Problems: 

\- the person in charge of digital projects has zero coding experience. Engineer by trade, zero clue about software development. Everything is treated like a R&amp;D project rather than something that can be made into a product and shipped.

\- all the other developers (3) are straight out of university. There are no senior/lead developers. No project/product managers, just big ideas and then hack away at them for months. I get on well with the folks at the company so mentioned that it would be good to structure, take a more methodical approach etc (the dreaded Agile..) and got a big thumbs up. Now find myself in a quasi-leadership role, but what I want to be doing is getting better at programming in a professional software development environment - not one that doesn't use Git properly because it's too complicated for the non-coders to change the HTML, not one that doesn't write tests, the list goes on...

\- we recently lost out on some project funding for digital project, I have been pushing towards going to a tech accelerator, and getting some industry commercial, digital and product support. This isn't happening so far.

&amp;#x200B;

I really like the people at the company, I'm grateful for the chance - I don't know if that's tinting the reality of where I'm working...

Should I leave? Only been 6 months, but there hasn't been much appreciable change since day 1 - I've introduced proper workflows, git branching strategies and product lifecycle type stuff to streamline and document new feature addition but I'm really going in the dark here.

30,Work has myself and coworkers doing on-call shifts regularly without extra compensation. I want to organize coworkers to fight back and am looking for advise,"Our company has us each doing week-long on-call shifts without extra compensation (since we're salaried). Week-long shifts include weekends and holidays. These on-calls mean we have to have our phones on us and be ready to hop on the computer within 5 minutes of an incident. Incidents can then last a few minutes to a few hours. 

I find this incredibly unreasonable because it means we can't enjoy our free time. If my friend asks if I want to go out to a bar, I have to say no. If I want to go hiking in the mountains without reception, I can't. Work says that if I want to do these things all I have to do is find someone to cover my shift, but that's unreasonable if it's short notice, no-one's online, or no-one wants to cover me. 

Several people have complained, but we haven't collectively brought our grievances to management. I'd like to do that. Organizing a union in tech is too spicy for most people, so I'm definitely not looking to go that far. I just want to know what people think about:

* My current situation generally
* How I should organize my coworkers without being fired
* What our demands should be and how we can force management to meet them (I doubt I can get a majority of on-call workers to support this effort, so what can a minority do?)

31,"I was responsible for 30% of the company's billing (small European company), I asked for a small percentage on my projects' profits, it was explicitly denied by the owner, so I left. Did I handle this correctly?","The company had around 25 people, in Europe. We all had fixed salaries with no bonuses, no scheduled raises, nothing.

I was directly responsible for managing and executing projects that constituted 30% of the company's earnings. In addition, many of those projects were then cloned and re-used by other members of the team, and the same thing goes for the tech I used, which meant that my work actually facilitated other teams.

I used this as leverage and asked for a small percentage of the INCOME produced by my projects, in addition to my salary. Consider that ""production bonus"", if you will.

The owner agreed to my terms, then thought about it for three days, called me back and refused my offer, saying ""it was not possible"". In addition, he said ""he would offer me a small percentage of the profits made by the products he wanted to build with the future new company he wanted to form with me and other team members"".

I refused, shut down my laptop, and left everything and everyone high and dry. This was 9 months ago, and they are still struggling to fill my shoes, they have people working overtime, they were forced to refused new projects for lack of manpower, and are now shifting to less demanding tech to be able to handle with a less-competent team.

All of this cause he was unwilling to share profits...

I already had a better-paying alternative, but I felt it was worth pursuing something better in my current company first.

32,I'm trying to quit my job but the company keeps offering things to get me to stay.,"It's a generally great company to work for, latest machines that will easily be replaced if required, great tech, very open to staying relevant, very talented people. However, I would like to resign. I've actually officially handed in my resignation. I gave a lot more than the required notice period since my role is a bit specialised. I knew they'd need all the time they can get to hire a replacement. My team is amazing and we have great rapport and my boss is ok compared to the average. So naturally he was shocked I wanted to quit since this is objectively a great company and team to work for. I'm just mentally exhausted and I'm not leaving for another company, I'm just taking time off to reassess things.   


The first two weeks after my resignation were fine but now wow. He is offering everything. More money, less hours is the general summary. He is also offering to allow me to freelance and charge per hour. Thing is, it's not about that. I just don't want to anymore. I also have some company related gripes (that I didn't share of course) that are part of the reason I'm leaving. However due to the generally positive relationships we have I feel like I'm being emotionally blackmailed. Like ""oh come on please, you know how hard it will be to replace you so just work a few hours to keep us chugging along for a few months, come on please. You aren't even going to be working, *surely* you could spare 4 or 5 hours a week to consult"". To me, a few hours a week consulting just isn't worth it financially, and it certainly isn't worth it mentally because I will end up working more than that ""after hours"" because I do a lot of research outside of work hours. And if I were to bill for those research hours I honestly might as well be hired at the very least part-time. And I don't want that.   


My problem is I feel like if I say no to ""just a couple of hours a week consulting to keep us on track"" I will be ruining the relationship since I'm essentially refusing to help. I know I don't have to do anything, I've resigned. But am I right in worrying about souring relations with this very good company and I won't be able to use them as a reference in the future?",cscareerquestions,1636535078

35,How to politely refuse to work on a different project?,"My current organisation has a problem of very low retention rate. The rate at which employees are leaving is more than the employees joining. To tackle this management is shifting current employees to projects which needs more resources. When the work of that project is done, shift to another project requiring more resources and this goes on and on. Since the past 3 months, I was moved to 2 different projects, both stressful where I had to extend my work timings, work on weekends, compromise my work-life balance and health.

I had mentioned this in my yearly appraisal meeting and gave this feedback to the management. Now again I am being asked to shift on a different project and this is really frustrating me out.

This project is not really that stressful as of now. They just want me to replace with an employee leaving. But I don't want to work in that project due to the following reasons:

1. I don't get along with the manager of that project. I had worked with him in the past and it wasn't a good experience. 
2. That project can go downhill anytime. It isn't bad as of now. But it has a reputation of going bad in the past multiple times. Bad client.

I've been promise by my current company great things are coming my way but we have all heard that story before, but I've also not given that a chance to materialise.

I don't want to throw away this opportunity, the culture, product and people are all lovely (I had a zoom call with the entire engineering team at my last stage).

As a plus, they offer pension match up to 12% (which is fucking high for here afaik), xmas bonus (it's been paid out every year, even during covid and has been as much as 10%, as little as 5%), same holiday package.

I'm on a non-tech track, working for a large MNC non-tech company (marketing firm), overseeing a few countries from an ops standpoint within one of the business verticals. I've started to pivot towards tech to get more involved with platform rollouts by helping tech teams taper their tools for people on the ground pushing for features that users need.

* Have done a few courses in CS and pursuing CS qualification on the side. Done: OS, Comp Architecture, Network tech, System design, Discrete Math, Calculus, intro programming classes. However I have no portfolio to show (CS noob).
* Have PM-ed in a smaller software company before(3+ years ago for \~2 yrs), done client deployments, shipped features, understand SDLC, managed tech teams for projects.

46,"Roles like ""Solutions Engineer"" can mean a lot of different things and are often different from company to company","I've seen some confusion about roles like ""Solutions Engineer"", ""Solutions Architect"", ""Sales Engineer"", etc, and I want to help make things clearer since these roles are great for some people with a CS background. 


 These roles mean different things from company to company. I've held the ""Solutions Engineer"" title at 3 different companies, and each job has been very different. These titles are interchangeable for a lot of client-facing engineering responsibilities, so it's important to understand what sort of work each role is doing.

----

These roles are usually either ""pre-sales' or ""post-sales"", and the responsibilities vary dramatically. Take a look at the following responsibilities from some job listings I found online:


##  **Datadog** - Solutions Engineer


* Respond to client requests on our fast paced team while continuing to educate our clients on the use of the platform

* Reproduce issues and dive into the 400+ integrations that Datadog works with

* Build out documentation and knowledge-based articles for a variety of technology

##  **Atlassian** - Solutions Engineer


* System integration, troubleshooting, administration, and configuration including Atlassian products, processing bugs and change requests, and building solutions in additional systems as needed 
* User documentation, including documentation for Jira workflows, release notes, and post-launch documentation for new features
* Feature definition and requirements, including producing design artifacts and refining requirements to implementation level for development


##  **Atlassian** - Solutions Engineer


* Configure and deliver deeply compelling presentations to customers and prospects, clearly communicating the value and differentiation of the Atlassian platform while showing how we seek their business challenge
* Partner with Sales Teams to develop winning account strategies, helping Atlassian to achieve revenue goals
* Contribute to the evolution of practices on the Solutions Engineering team through knowledge sharing, feedback loops, etc.


The first two roles are post-sales and the last role is pre-sales. Hell, the role is even dramatically different at the *same* company. 

If you're looking into getting into a customer-facing engineering role, keep this in mind so you aren't discouraged by a job listing just because of its title. If you assume all Solutions Engineers are post-sales support, you'll be missing out on a lot of amazing opportunities.",cscareerquestions,1636530516

49,Senior CS student beginning job hunt for post graduation.,"Hello, as the title says I’m a senior studying CS and on pace to graduate here in May. Currently I work part time during the school year at a large Fortune 500 tech company (“company A”) where I worked full time during the summer and breaks.
I love the team members that I work with and am definitely learning a lot every day as it’s a pretty friendly work environment and they’re trying to help me gain as much experience as I can from the place. I know my work is valued here but I think I just can’t really see myself wanting to do DevOps for a long period of my life, I think I’d rather be more in the developing, but also don’t have that real world experience to know for sure. 

Recently I applied and have made it through all but the final cuts (waiting to hear back) for another opportunity for app developer position at a decently sized company (“company B”) here in my college town and I can’t decide what the best plan moving forward will be. 

I know I have a full time position waiting for me at company A when I graduate and it’s a pretty solid job to have on the resume and it’ll be very well respected when friends or family ask me where I’m working… but I’m just not sure it really excites me like a dream job would. The pay would be okay but on the mid to lower range for fresh grads, there isn’t a whole lot of long term growth there for me if I don’t want to continue doing DevOps, and lastly it’s practically in my backyard back at home, which yea isn’t necessarily a negative because I’d be close to family + could maybe live at home for a year and just save a bunch of my salary and max the Roth/401k while living free under the parents roof, but I think I would also greatly enjoy living somewhere cool like Denver/Austin/Seattle/New York for a few years after college then settling down somewhere. 

That brings up the question, if company B here offers me this part time position for what I think I would be more interested in, do I take it and leave company A? 
Do I leave the guaranteed after grad job and take a chance here? They have also thrown out the idea of contracting me out and seeing how I do and then deciding in May if they want to offer full time or not. This is interesting because 1. if I really wanted to, bring contracted out sounds like I could make my own hours and therefore keep my job at Company A and work for Company B at night (but this would lose out on a lot of free time in my final year at University, which already had 1.5 years ruined by covid, so this has me hesitant as well) but also 2. This doesn’t sound nearly as guaranteed as the position I have waiting for me at company A when I graduate so I also don’t want to burn any bridges by leaving now and missing out on walking into a full time job with both companies. 

What do we think? I will also still be looking to add to my options but any advice is more than welcome, I appreciate you reading all that and giving any thoughts. Thank you!",cscareerquestions,1636529959
50,Considering SRE/DevOps Job as a Fresh Graduates," Hi, I'm a fresh graduate that receive a couple of job offers from two different company with a very interesting job descriptions (the managers also very nice, knowledgeable and willing to train fresh grad with zero experience). However, it's hard for me to decide due to various factors (shown below). My background: almost 2 years of experience as a part-time research assistant (develop healthcare IoT system, full-stack web development and mobile app development) during undergraduate and now as a solutions engineer intern for a large telecommunication company (work with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus etc). Self-taught cloud computing, DevOps culture and methodologies.

1st Offer:

\- From a medium size FinTech start-up; around 500-600 employees (MNC)  
\- Job title: Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineering  
\- Permanent job, work remotely  
\- Seems like I have a lot of opportunities to grow here. Go through 5 interview sessions for this job (able to meet CTO and Engineering Manager for SRE. Both are really nice guys and can learn a lot from them)  
\- Great people and company culture (flat-hierarchy and promote continuous learning)

2nd Offer:

\- From a giant internet company; more than 80k employees (China's company located in Singapore)  
\- Job title: DevOps Engineer  
\- Contract job (1 year; renewable), work remotely  
\- Job description just like regular DevOps but concern of it being a glorified SysAdmin (work with cloud, DB, CI/CD, Logging and Monitoring Tools)

First, I'm not sure about contract job, I want to prioritize my growth as DevOps/SRE (don't want to being treat less and receive less training compared to a full-time employee) and concern about job security. Second, the 2nd Offer have better salary and being a big company might help me build a solid job experiences (or at least on resume) but at the same time I really like the 1st Offer since I have the chances to meet with the people in the company which I believe I can learn a lot from there and they are known for having great people and company culture. For now I want to grow myself as DevOps/SRE and planning to seek better opportunity outside of my country later (maybe after 3 years). Which offer is better and I should take? Looking forward to some advice and feedbacks. Feels free to share some advice or tips for a person new to DevOps/SRE :).

Both have great salary RM4.5k-RM5K per month (around 1.2k USD per month, dirt cheap compared to US and EU but I'm highly confident this's higher than 95% entry level salary here)",cscareerquestions,1636529159

63,"Big retention bonus, stressful job. Should I stay?","I've been working for a big (top 50ish) company most of my 8YOE and am considered a high performer. I get paid extremely well (IMO) in a low cost of living area (265TC, 150+30+85), but I kinda hate my job. I'm really sick of the domain, hardly ever get to code, and spend most my time in meetings, partly because I know the domain so well and everyone has questions for me (both my team and others).

I had been seriously considering leaving for a year or so and finally started reaching out to a few contacts I had at companies I was interested in. Informal though, didn't even update my LinkedIn profile. Then out of nowhere they closed our small office in the LCOL area (main office is in a HCOL area), laying off most of the engineers. A few of us were deemed ""critical"" and offered big retention bonuses to stay on as remote. Mine is 75k, paid Aug 1 if stay through then. However, the thought of staying another nine months makes me want to cry.

So, I'm trying to decide if I should leave despite the bonus. After doing some research, I'm starting to realize maybe I'm not overpaid after all, and it's likely some other jobs would end up paying higher TC. So, even if I'd make less in 2022, it would be a wash over the course of another year or two.

I also keep telling myself I need to put my mental health first and get a job I'll like, but it still feels arrogant to not at least wait until Aug.

Has anyone here ever walked from a retention bonus (or paid it back if it was the up-front kind)? Did you regret it?

76,Handling imposter syndrome,"I know, it’s an awesome of topic. But for me right now it’s a salient one.

Background: six years a developer, all in .NET/C#. A little front end, almost all backend. Move way up the food chain. Got The Big Job at a python shop. Aced the interview. Offered a gig one step below Senior. Great pay bump - exactly the kind my family needed.

One month in and now I’m putting a ton of pressure on myself. I know how to write clean code, how to make systems talk to each other, how to write good tests, how to write business logic, how to write defensively against unexpected data, etc. But! Every project manages dependencies differently and they some are started with npm, or yarn, or paver, or a shell script. It’s never as simple as `git clone`, `npm start`. Sometimes docker is used, sometimes not. Not all projects are deployed the same way.

I feel like I’m too slow on account of all the hurdles from the lack of consistency. I’m paranoid that my coworkers think I suck because I don’t produce at the same speed. I’m told to ask for help if I get stuck, so I do, and have to 2 or 3 times a day which feels like I’m leaning too hard on others. If I don’t ask sometimes I can power through but fuck I hate looking at GitHub issue pages that *might* be the same problem.

Cue imposter syndrome. Were I still single I’d think “worst case scenario you find a different job,” but I’ve four kids. I fear, probably unnecessarily, that they’ll can my ass. I have asked for specifics on expectations. I have gotten crickets.

78,Unpopular Opinion: Working from home sucks,"For some context, I'm a new grad working in a junior engineer position at a large company. My company has repeatedly delayed their return to office date and now they may be majority WFH permanently.

It's not that I want to be in the office or that I hate being home all day, it's that I don't want to be working alone 100% of the time.

 Here are my reasons:

1. I took my junior dev position to learn and become a better engineer so I can work on something I'm passionate about in the future. While I'm still learning, it's harder to get help remotely, I get help less often, and l believe that you can learn more from someone in-person than over a slack call or screenshare. I also think that remote work lacks informal communication which can often be a great learning experience. (People won't talk shit about the company or give you real career advice over work calls - they will in person.) I can understand how senior devs wouldn't care as much about this.
2. All throughout college and the start of my career people have stressed how important networking is to one's career. I know my teammates pretty well on a professional level, but it's hard to make an impression on anyone outside of my immediate team remotely. I can count the number of people I've met outside of my team since I started 4 months ago on one hand. How am I supposed to get to know my skip-level manager who's never in any of my meetings if I don't see him naturally by being in the office? I know there are sometimes remote social events available, but after spending 8 hours on my laptop the last thing I want to do at the end of the day is sit in front of my laptop any longer.
3. From a personal perspective, I'm in my early 20s and moved to a new city for this job where I barely know anyone (moving was a requirement for the job). I totally understand how devs with spouses and children would prefer to work from home because they have people to socialize with. The idea of spending the next 10+ years without any face-to-face communication every single day is honestly just depressing. I want to spend my life surrounded by others, not in my bedroom by myself typing away at a keyboard.

To be honest, it's really frustrating seeing internal posts for my company, or posts on LinkedIn where 99% of the comments are supporting permanent WFH. I understand people's perspectives, but it sucks to see the standard industry opinion is the opposite of mine. However, I think that a lot of my friends who graduated with me seem to hold similar opinions. I haven't even had the chance to dislike working in the office.

In a few years when I'm moving to my next job the WFH situation will definitely be a factor in my decision, but for now, it just sucks. I'm not advocating for full-time work in the office, 3 days in 2 days out sounds ideal to me.",cscareerquestions,1636516459

TL:DR; I fucked up which is going to fuck my promotion big time
  
Back story, I work in a middle-large sized IT firm. I have been working my ass my for past 3 years to get my promotion which should have gotten me the best hike as I have very high visibility in my organization at all levels. Currently a lead specialist and I was expecting a promotion to architect position in next quarter since the discussions went smoothly in last appraisal.
  
Last month we encountered a production bug which was financially impactful for the client and our in house product which went under my supervision and although we made a fix immediately, minutes after it was first reported, we couldn’t get appropriate approvals and QA okay for a hot fix until the next 48 hours and the client suffered a loss. Now all the hardwork is gone, client bashed us like anything even when their QA missed the bug.
  
For past month my team has been lectured and the way it looks my promotion might/might not happen and this is killing me on a personal level. Now it has come to a point where people are indirectly trying to spoon feed me/us with the basics. I understand my role and that I am responsible for my developers and they’re not impacted by this since their ratings are dependent on my feedback. But my ratings have taken a hit because of all this. I am getting anxiety even when someone says the name of the client or our product even.

95,(Early Career) Feeling stuck.,"I graduated in December 2019 with a degree in CS, and a lot of experience in mechanical engineering (I found my passion pretty late in my college career).
I currently work for the federal government as a developer, and have been here for 2 years now. There were considerations that made this job make sense at the time, but I have been trying to figure out how to leave ever since I started. Basically, my first position was on a project that literally had no work, and I was actively told I couldn’t do anything to advance my skills for the first several months. So I didn’t touch code for the first year of my career. I got a transfer to a new team and I’ve been working as a full stack dev for the last year, and I couldn’t ask for a position better designed to put buzzwords on a resume. The problem is, we’re still in an early prototype, so nothing I’ve really worked on has had a measurable impact. So that part of my resume is blank. I’m getting frustrated at all the hoops we have to jump through for security reasons, and at how impersonal everything is. I’ve had 5 managers since January, and none of them stay around long enough to learn what we even do. So when we had to write up our appraisals, our boss took a sideline to her boss, who literally evaluated me on two points: shows up to work, and does work where no problems should arise. I’m literally performing at the same level as our tech lead, and my measure boils down to “isn’t an idiot”. It’s been extremely demotivating seeing all my work and effort being so overlooked. My team appreciates my effort, but I’m literally getting paid $54,000 with no way to advance my career based on my skills as a developer, only time has any impact on my pay, and the pay band they offer has 10 year developers making 90k. Which is good money, but not for that level of experience. I’ve been sending out applications and talking to companies who see my resume and application and have a phone call and then respond with “you don’t have the background we need” as if they didn’t have all that information before you set up a phone screening. Is this a typical experience or is there something I should be doing to be able to move my career in any direction? I realize that’s vague, I just feel like I’ve checked all the boxes, and then I get rejected because my resume accurately reflects my experience?",cscareerquestions,1636511521
96,The Cost of Working Remotely,What salary % would you slash to be able to work in a different state than your employer? (Asking for a friend),cscareerquestions,1636510730
97,"Started a new job 3 weeks ago. I hate it and want to quit. I feel like the recruiter wasn't very transparent, maybe I was just too dumb to ask the right questions.","I replied to a recruiter on LinkedIn who said he had exciting opportunities for me. At the time I was working as a DEV and I wasn't actively looking for a new job, but he said the salary would be almost double what I was making, so I decided there was no harm in interviewing.

He warned me before the interviews to hold back any hesitation and give each interview my enthusiastic all.

One job I interviewed for sounded a little like...tech support. It was within the tech support division of an amazing company, but the interviewers told me the there would be a great deal of development as well. In order to give it my enthusiastic all, I said that I was fine working some tech support problems and that I'm competent at resolving them (both true) but that I wanted to primarily stay a developer working with the latest technology and practices. They said that they had a lot of cutting edge work.

I spoke to the recruiter about my concerns (that it was heavily in tech support, they mentioned some older stacks) and he told me that he knew the manager well, and that each employee got assigned things that matched their experience and interests.

After our chat my conclusion was that since I've got a heavy background in the latest development, they'd see that once I got there and I'd be able to specialize in the tech support division's development problems. Worst case scenario, I could transfer to another department in a year or two.

On my first day, I found out that my team is actually just one other girl and we're doing tech support for so many companies that there's not really any room to be specializing or transferring. Their idea of development is writing small scripts to move files around. We just do what we're assigned and most of it is obsolete technology that I'm sure will completely disappear in 5 years but I have to learn it. The girl I'm working with is severely overworked. There is a completely separate division that does actual development so it's won't be a matter of just getting assigned development tasks.

I want to quit but I feel like I can't, at least not for at least 6 months. My friend who's also a DEV is telling me to request a transfer but I feel like that'd be incredibly unprofessional since I know my teammate is drowning in support tasks and this \*was\* the job that I interviewed for. The recruiter had the right responses to all my concerns at the time, but now I feel a little played since he probably just got his bonus.

I feel like my interviewer was honest in the interview about the job being tech support oriented, we just had a different definition of what development meant. I know they're having a really hard time with their workload. I really like all the people that I've met so far. But I don't enjoy the type of work they're doing here at all. I saw what some of my teammates were doing in the development division and it looked so fun, then I had to go back to my desk to call a customer about a failing printer. I've barely written a line of code in 3 weeks.

I only have 2.5 years in the workforce, what is the most professional way to handle this?",cscareerquestions,1636510590

For context, I graduated in 2020, but have been unsuccessful in finding an internship, and currently working in retail for the purpose of making money to pay bills and live, haha. My PASSION is to enter the game development industry, but I understand the immense challenge that doing that would entail so I opted to become a full-stack developer and start my career that way. I have essentially been using free time on my side projects and [coursera.org](https://coursera.org), so my actual job hunt is very spread out, as I just don't think what I have will even get me a 1st interview.  


I've seen that many projects in both example resumes and resumes in the review section have projects that track gained profits, or total users per month, all these metrics that my projects simply don't have. Because of this I don't think my projects can really be described all too well in more than one sentence and I just don't know what to put time into to make me stand out more. Am I overthinking this? Does it matter what project you do as long as you have a drive to code (which I'm pretty sure I do)? Should I just try to figure out a more complicated project?

However I don't want to waste my employment opportunities. I have been out of university for 5 months and I couldn't find any jobs in C++. I know I lack domain expertise and so some part of me wants to do a computer science MSc as I believe that would be more attractive.

I don't mind doing computer science as some subjects like operating system, embedded systems, computer vision, concurrent programming and high performance computing interests me. But the university I'm looking at doesn't offer some of these :( I'm also more interested in high level maths.

I just attended an event by Ford listed on handshake as ""Real Talk Tuesday"". It's supposed to be a weekly event that offers ""exclusive opportunity to hear from 3 of our current employees about their experiences working for Ford Motor Company through an identity-based lens."" This week listed 2 panel members who had interesting IT related roles, so I figured i'd attend and ask them some questions about the company and IT specifically within Ford.

Unfortunately, I highly suspect that the event was pre-recorded. On top of that, all the questions which they claim were from audience members simply were softball PR style questions that seemed to have been rehearsed by the panel members beforehand. I tried posting questions in the chat near the end, but at no point were any chat based questions answered.

I hope this doesn't come across as a hit piece against Ford, because it's not.

21,Dealing with two Companies Fighting to Hire you,"I’m in a very good situation, but also a bad one when it comes to the career change part. The TL;DR of the situation is that my current company gutted the IT department and is contracting out most of the IT functions. I have been in a secure job, but wanted a change so I have been searching for about a year and a half (casually) for a remote cloud economist job.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out to (Company A) about a role and went through the interview process. While waiting to hear their final decision, another company (Company B) reached out with a job opportunity (3-month contract to hire). After the first-round interview with Company B, Company A extended a verbal offer which would give me a $23K raise over current salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a conversation with the recruiter for Company B I found out that this job (C2H) would pay $63K over my current salary. In a follow up conversation with Company A, I wanted to see if the offer was negotiable due to the offer from Company B and as Company A’s offer was under the average for the role around $20K. They said that they were firm.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, while getting pressure to accept or decline the offer (verbal only at this point), Company B comes back to me saying that they really do want me and upped their offer (without asking) to a raise of $94K over my current salary.

So I got a return job offer with the company I did my internship this past summer. I graduate next month. The internship was remote given that all the company offices were closed and they will be until the end of this year. There will be a decision on if the company offices will open again at the beginning of January. I have the option to move to San Jose, CA or to work remotely next year. I live in the south in the U.S. I am debating if I should move or not. I got offered 120k, along with a relocation bonus. If I stay I can take advantage of the low cost of living I have where I live and be able to save, I'll be able to pay off the 15k student loans I have left too. (I know the salary will be lowered, but still). There is also the part of me that has a strong imposter syndrome and thinks of the worst case scenario. I feel like I didn't even prove myself to get this position, I only wrote like 8 lines of code during the 3 month internship, and no technical question in the interview. If some how I don't adjust to the position it would be easier to leave if I am living in my current state.

I also have the option of being remote for a few months and then moving to San Jose. I also tend to get anxious in new environments so I have to take that into account. I feel like if I moved after being remote for a few months it would be kind of overwhelming, having to adjust to work and a new city. I am leaning more towards moving, having a month off to get the hang of the city and then starting the position. 

I know for a fact that I want to move at some point, that's not up for debate, it is a matter of when. It's either before I start the position or a few months into being in the position remotely. 

This will be my first professional job and keep in mind I have lived my whole life in the south.

I am a little nervous about this transition none the less. I am the first in my family to graduate high school, let alone college.

The same should apply to your career. If you want to get a good job right after college, you can’t start looking for it right after college. You can’t start investing in your career at the same time when you want to reap the rewards.

Growing your career, growing technically, and positioning yourself well in the job market, starts long before we need the job. Our investments and efforts compound over time, and the essential factor in this equation is precisely that - time.

As soon as you can recognize the direction you would like to explore and grow in, you should grab any opportunity to do so. Do not wait to graduate to start building your skill-set. Do not wait for the job market to show you the educational gaps. Fill them yourself, and do it before you need the job.

Early in your career, you are very valuable, yet not at all profitable. Your value is in your potential, not your realizations. You are a great long-term investment, but a pretty bad short-term one. Not all companies can afford to tutor you and help you realize your potential.

49,Questions about a degree in CS.,"Hello, I am interested in getting a degree in computer science and the only field I am interested in is technology in general, I don't know if I like programming cause I have never had any experience with it (due to not having a laptop at my teens I am 20 now), I am good at math and I like math. I will be graduating debt free if I choose to go into CS cause my country pays for it if you get above a certaim grade.

I have these questions and I would really appreciate any guidance and help, thank you in advance...

1- Do you like the field now? Did you like it before you went into the field?

2- if you cam go back in time would you major in CS again?

3- what does the job market look like now? And what will it look like in 4 years when I get my degree?

4- How does the degree fair when you get older? Like is it true that you have to keep learning new languages as you get older? And how does the job market look like for people who are older is the job market more favorable to young people?

5- what will I get from a degree in CS that I wouldn't get in a degree like Electrical Engineering, in terms of skills/knowledge and marketability.
 
6- will having no prior programming experince be a problem going into CS?",cscareerquestions,1636490334
50,Should I take the job?,"So I'm a computer science major in his senior year, and I've been applying to jobs so that I can get a full time position when I graduate from college. I have a 3.6/4.0 GPA and completed four internships and a TA position during my time in college.

My most recent two internships were with a notable (top 5) DoD contractor, and recently they offered me a full time entry-level position for $77k/year. That's about the market average for an entry-level software engineer. For being in the DMV area, I wouldn't consider this bad, but I feel like there's potential to make a lot more (maybe this subreddit has given me some wild ideas). There's also plenty of benefits that come with the position, such as free healthcare and receiving a top-secret security clearance, which could be useful for other positions in the future.

On one hand, I'm really happy that I got this opportunity, but on the other, I feel like I'm being undervalued for that much. I need to make the decision to accept or reject the offer within a few days, so there isn't much time. Should I risk not accepting the offer so I can apply to different companies and hope to score a higher-paying position entry-level position?",cscareerquestions,1636490206

57,"New grad. First job is a clusterfuck. Do I leave, or stick it out?","So, long story short, I graduated and took the first job I was offered. It's 115k base, 156k including cash bonuses. So I was kind of dazzled. Right out of college - It's more money than I've ever seen, so I kind of took the job without shopping around to see what else I could get.

Turns out, this company going through some massive reorgs and is just the most disorganized mess on the planet. I've been here about 5 months. I've learned a decent amount about CI/CD, AWS kinda stuff. Lots of SRE type activities.

But...recently, they transferred me to another team with a radically different stack and basically are having me start from scratch. Completely without warning. Plus, they decreased our bonuses to about 20% of what they were when I was hired. And dealing with others in the company, it feels like a ton of people left because of the reorg so now there's a bunch of replacements who barely know what is going on, because the documentation is shit. So everyone needs help with everything and nobody can give me a straight answer on anything. Even super basic stuff, like, ""which lambda function is responsible for this product feature?"" or ""Which machine has our k8s environment?""

It's not the most stressful company ever, despite all this. They understand they're insanely disorganized. They aren't blaming me for anything (yet). But this all just makes me feel like I need to move on already, because it's a terrible environment to build my knowledge. So now I'm in a predicament -- do I leave after just 5 months? I'm not worried about learning a new environment -- I felt like I was just getting good at my environment, and then they move me to a totally new one. So either way, I'm going to feel like a new hire. I don't worry too much about that. What does concern me is my resume -- how many recruiters look at me trying to job hob after 5 months and think that I'm a good hire? I want to be able to leverage the skills I have actually managed to learn on the job, without looking like I'm a job hopper.

Do I leave it off my resume entirely? If so, that means it looks like I've been unemployed since May. Plus, it's already on my linkedin.

I'm a good engineer. I think. But how do I survive in a massively confusing environment that might just transfer me to another team on another product with a completely different stack, without warning, again in a few months? Plus, there's the whole axing our bonuses thing too. No wonder their retention is shit.

63,Newbie adult career switch Looking to Switch into Data Science,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 37yo math teacher looking to possibly switching into data science (or some other programming career).  I'm particularly looking for a way to use my math skills in programming, to get a solid job (I don't need to be rich, just stable and happy).

So far, data science has seemed the most interesting to me, but I'm open to other suggestions.

In particular a few questions:

1.  What's the best way to learn?  I'd really appreciate the structure of something more formal rather than totally self-study.  DataCamp has seemed cool so far in the free previews of Python and SQL, should I spend the money for the account there or is there a better cheap-ish website out there?
2. Should I get an MS in data science?  I saw my local university offers an MS in data analytics for 25k.  That is probably a bit too steep for me, but I keep seeing ads for an Eastern University offering an MS in data science for 10k.  That sounds a lot more attractive to me, but is it too good to be true?
3. I'm a bit worried that my past experience has nothing to do with CS as a math teacher, so would I be able to get a job after I learn the language?  Does my plan to learn the language and career switch at 37yo seem possible?  I feel pretty stuck in my math teaching career, which frankly has just not been successful (I put in a lot of effort, but I'm just more of an introvert personality which is not always great for teaching)

65,Contacted by a Startup on Triplebyte for a Lead position but I have no SWE experience...,"I took a few Triplebyte assessments a few weeks ago to get a feel for the site and got one score in the 90th percentile range and two scores around the middle of the pack. I threw my profile on looking for a job and filled it with honest information, indicating I had 0 YOE, only listed technologies I truly felt I have a good grasp on, and included all my non-SWE work experience. In short, my profile screams newbie.

Fast forward to today, I woke up with a message on TripleByte from the CEO of a small startup saying he thought I'd be a great addition to the team and to send him some recent work I've done for him to review so that we could possibly set up a call. However, the specific role he contacted me about is a lead front end engineer, and when I track the job posting down, it calls for 3+ YOE.

I'm at a loss on how best to proceed here. My portfolio of projects *does not* demonstrate anywhere close to 3+ YOE or lead material, and at best it demonstrates that I'm capable of making not entirely ugly UIs, basic CRUD apps, and the occasional clever algorithm implementation. At the same time, I feel like I'd be stupid not to reply and the person who reached out to me can see my profile and would be able to know that I'm a total newbie. I'd, obviously, love to jump on a job but worry that I'd be *unbelievably* in over my head in this situation.

Does anyone have advice on how best to proceed? Should I be honest with where I'm at skills wise when replying? Should I just let loose my portfolio and see what happens?",cscareerquestions,1636486752

I'm now a 32 year old man with a wife and kids. The majority of my jobs have been IT, including my current, all self taught or picked up via experience.

I was assigned a mentor, but I haven't been given much guidance. On my first day in the office, I didn't even know where to go because no one had communicated that information to me. The day prior I even asked about where to go, but it still wasn't clarified. I finally found my desk, but then no one offered to show me around the office. I had to ask where the bathrooms were.

Beyond that, I have had to ask repeatedly for help setting up my environment to work on user stories. The first user story I was assigned involved major UI changes with components made in-house that have little to no documentation. I also had no understanding of what the previous UI looked like. I did what I was assigned, but the QA team came back with more changes for me to make. However, the issues that were found were not because of the changes that I had made, but I feel they were ""blamed"" on me. Now, I have to work with the UX team to redesign a majority of our pages.

The UI story also has a short deadline. The senior developers have been asking me to deploy my code changes, but no one has even told me that process. I don't feel like anyone on my team has pro-actively tried to help me with anything. Is this normal? I try to ask as many questions as possible, but sometimes I don't know the right questions to ask. It feels like they think I should know how to do everything.

I am also concerned with our code review process. We have a short meeting as a team each week for ""code reviews"", but it's more like a demo. I am not getting any direct feedback from other developers. I have tried proactively sending emails to others on my team for feedback on what I am doing, but I don't get much response. I want to learn and grow as much as possible. Is this the normal code review process?

I don't want to overreact, but I am thinking about looking for other opportunities. Am I wrong in doing that? Is it too soon?

Junior developer left with no guidance on major UI/UX changes. Feel blamed for QA issues that were found although I don’t believe they are due to me.

Even though we were bigger I still gave them feedback, suggestions, things that didn't seem right, things we can improve on, and I still end up working my ass off until 4am to get features out, write proper documentation, and well in general do great work to raise another round of funding. Of course, when there were things we can do better I would bring it up so we all have health discussions and work together to fix things. Startup went from flat to a hierarchical super fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I gotta say I burn out a bit and took PTO for two weeks now after I had finished this massive feature we had to put out there. Just last week (while I was in PTO), they called me back to work and I had one day to make changes to the feature because of some last minute blocker. I worked from 9am  - 4am straight that day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Today I was let go not because of my work but because I'm too outspoken** and that kind of behavior is apparently not good. ""As a developer, you should not talk, just write code and do what you're told ggrrrr"".

98,Which path should I take?,"So for some background info, I’m currently in school pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Cybersecurity. I really wanted to develop a very well rounded knowledge base of the IT world in general, so after coming to the conclusion that there’s plenty of great information on CS outside of university, I decided to go the self study route with that while going to school for the other stuff.

It’s going great so far, I’ve learned a lot about networking, the security side of things, and we’re even getting into cloud stuff. I’ve gotten a couple of certs and also landed a really great part-time help desk technician job that not only pays well, but has given me a great mentor that has shown me a ton about sys admin stuff and scripting. And on my own self-study journey with CS, I’ve found that I have a passion for programming. 

I have solely been learning Python right now and since my self-studying method doesn’t come with a concrete curriculum like in schools, I figured I would ask you all for advice. 

***Would it be better to broaden my horizons to other programming languages after I feel I have a good hold on python? Or should I keep diving down the python rabbit hole and become very proficient at it before moving on to other languages?***

After realizing that I really like programming, my goal is to eventually learn all I need to get a SWE job, or at least one that will set me up for a SWE job.",cscareerquestions,1636477221

0,Advice for trying to self start into some form of QA after disability,"My background: 1 year server support (Mostly log reading and permission verification) 4 years end line tech support for major telecom (Primarily various device troubleshooting, networking/radio troubleshooting. Gained A+ and Network+ certs here, which have expired now) and then 4 years at the local hospital as a Data Center Analyst in IT (My position was very... Plug the hole, so the speak. It started doing a variety of things, making guides, full computer setup and software setup of  entire outside offices and eventually got moved to full time Helpdesk support without a title change as we could still be pulled onto other various projects though most of them being physical computer repair or imaging. Helpdesk threw me pretty far though, interface monitoring and management, Tons of AD modifications, software troubleshooting for very dense medical softwares). I do not have a degree of any kind. Only some college experience of a few semesters of different subjects: Psychology, Biology, CS - But life happened each attempt. 

Well in 2019 I had a very traumatic experience which led to me going on short term disability. Tried to return to work, couldn't deal, went on leave again - ran out of FMLA and was let go as I returned to short term disability at the start of 2020 and am currently on long term disability. 

That being said, my condition has gotten very far in recovery and I feel like I'm approaching the point to return to the workforce.

&amp;#x200B;

All of my jobs thus far have been phone support based primarily. With my current condition it's unreasonable for me to put myself back into a position that relies on being verbally drained for 8 hours as my communication skills in that regard still exist, as does customer service - I'm just not sure I could tolerate the verbal abuse this type of job endures at this point in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

... So, trying to put my feelers out and at least start researching some opportunities. As I've reflected my favorite thing about my prior job was finding application errors, ease of use or workflow issues within software. I was very hyper critical to even small things like, this radio button should be higher up, or why is this in multiple tabs when it could be one? To the point I feel like I was perceived at stepping out of my position and/or the issues brought up simply weren't worktime/cost effective to focus on. Workflow being a HUGE deal, since we worked with Doctors in a very high pace environment. I didn't quite make it further in the company as I had no interest in doing their Client Team - which were effectively the office slaves above us primarily for physical computer setups and imaging with some light software management (Maybe they were the ones to call support on this very niche software that does a very niche thing). They required a degree to move into any other position adjacent (Their software analysts maybe had all of 2-3$ pay difference from our client team). I did really admire the positions which did the builds for the primary software we used. Shadowed several of them over the years. Though, they were abused even moreso than us due to the high intensity needed for the software at a hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to trying to realistically understand what my next step may be. Looking over a lot of QA jobs most at least want an understanding of the 'QA and testing procedures', some 'basic knowledge of a programming language and SQL programming'

It seems a lot of them focus on automation of testing and 'creating test plans and test cases'

I'm happy to be a grunt or entry level. I feel like my work experience thus far is at least somewhat comparable to an associates degree, though I fully understand the piece of paper would get me further. Work fine under stress, if anything I get energized by intense scenarios (Such as a major software breaking at the hospital). So the idea of tight deadlines doesn't bother me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just want to know some thoughts. I've just been casually browsing job postings in the region recently and feel like I'm right on the edge for being viable for these positions. I've gotten to the point with my health I'm starting to try and learn things online to show I did... Something, while I had ""time off"". Still not even sure how I'm going to bridge the gap of time in an interview though. Guess I'm wondering if any of these self taught resources would be worth the time? I'll probably do some to at least say 'Yes I have an understand of SQL' (Currently my experience with SQL is back in like... The early 2000s setting up home web and game severs which used something like MySQL for login management which... Wasn't complex at all. I recently took an online database related course. I can understand the concepts without issue, but bridging the gap to commands I'm not familiar with were the issue), but I guess my worry comes down to credibility if they ask for it. I know when applying for the hospital they had a basic A+ type skills assessment. Reading a lot of posts on here and adjacent subs seems any programming based job wants a skills tests to be done. Is QA in that similar theme? Not sure how directly 'programming' related it is outside of maybe... Powershell or python to maybe automate tests?

Also completely open to other suggestions of next step type jobs. I'm such a jack of all trades it's majorly hurting me now. I love design, but never pursued art or software design directly. I don't mind light coding and have a firm grasp of OOP from personal projects over the years which don't have much of an example to present, but I don't have interest in becoming a full time programmer. So I feel like I'm between a rock and a hardplace wanting to get away from client support. I'm fine with working in teams, and love it when a team actually... Does work together. Last job was very much left and right hand don't coordinate, and even some fingers on one hand didn't communicate at all. And I'm referring primarily to our software, database and server analysts.

15,Am I hirable?,"I'm a Front-end web developer. I got hired as a contractor before I was finished with trade school (the job counted as school hours, so I completed the program). In school, I learned HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and JS. I worked with WordPress a little but hated it. Then I got hired as a part-time contractor to mostly build simple landing pages in Salesforce.

I did really well at my job and earned full-time contractor hours. I started working with the main company site on Sitecore. I did really well with that, and eventually I became the main person working on the company's website. Building templates, new pages, and learning a lot more about how to work with Sitecore. 

The problem is I've never really been secure in my job. I was a contractor for a year, then they hired me as a ""temporary employee,"" meaning I'm still hourly and get no PTO. They have been reluctant to let me be a permanent employee while remaining fully remote (my one stipulation). They fired my boss and told me they were going to give me his job, but that was forever ago, and they are literally ignoring my questions about it.
 
I'd love to get a job somewhere else, but the thing is, with this job, I've pretty much ***only*** learned Sitecore content management. I do a little bit of work with C# and JS when making rendering variants, but nothing big. I've gotten better with HTML and CSS (especially SCSS). I can do simple things in JS. I've all but forgotten everything about PHP, SQL, WordPress, etc. I don't know any JS frameworks likes React or Angular. And I think I'm overpaid! I'm making ~$40/hr to work in a CMS! I'm in a nightmare position of wondering how long this job can continue and thinking that there's no way I'll do well at another job. My resume looks good because of the ""experience,"" but if I were asked some technical questions in an interview, I think I would embarrass myself.

I try to learn things on my own, but I've been dealing with a lot of outside-of-work tragedy and am honestly too exhausted most days. I'm getting treated for possible ADHD (innatentive type), so maybe that will help.

So I’m just sitting here scrolling thru the giant project files almost in tears cause it’s all so massive and even to get running locally is a huge undertaking…

I don’t want to bug them while they’re fixing production issues…. But I also worry that if I don’t get some guidance they’re going to think I’m just here for a paycheck.

Recent grad,"I graduated in May 2021 with a Finance and Information Systems double major from a good school in the North East US. I have had multiple internships in Finance and am now working full time at a major bank as a financial analyst. I always had interest in CS but didn't major in it since I had undiagnosed ADHD until now which made it impossible to study, but still majored in Information Systems as I enjoyed the coursework without it being too demanding. 

Having been recently diagnosed and medicated I find myself able to finally have the attention span to learn/study properly, and in addition to not liking my current job/industry I want to explore what my information systems major can get me. I have taken classes on Virtual Basic (VBA), Python, SQL, PHP, HTML &amp; CSS and have used programs like Tableau, Microsoft Access, etc. I also am generally pretty resourceful and great at problem solving (at least relative to others in my field and classes at school). Even in my current job I've been recognized as very above average with Excel and VBA for macros.

How feasible is a career change to something related to CS? I am ready to learn a lot on the job and have much more passion for this field than my monotonous finance job right out of school. Specifically I'm wondering what kinds of jobs I could be a good fit for with my IS major assuming I brush up on my existing knowledge and potentially learn more on the side.   

If anyone has had a similar experience or is knowledgeable about any of this I would greatly appreciate some input. Thanks!

29,considering a CS degree to go alongside a Biochemistry degree,"Heyo,  first time posting here, and this is going to be a rather longish post,  but I hope I can come out of this with a bit more knowledge as to if  what I have in mind is a good or not so good idea.

A  bit of background about me, but basically, I kind of worked backwards  from my conclusion when deciding on a degree. Throughout HS, and even  middle school the only thing that really clicked with me was science. I  really enjoyed Biology, and over time I grew to particularly like the  chemistry side of Biology (hence Biochem). At the same time I also  wanted to pursue medical school or perhaps Pharmacy, so between those  two things I felt that a Biochemistry degree would be perfect for me in  college. Fast forward about 3ish years, and well to be blunt, I don't  think I really want to do med school anymore. What I've unfortunately  learned over the past 2-3 years is that med school is not for me, but  despite that I really love my Biochemistry degree. I just love  chemistry, and I love a lot of what I'm learning and studying.  Unfortunately, what I'm not very happy with is my future job prospects  with just a bachelors, which has lead to me questioning if I should just  get a masters or double major in something else.

Alongside  the natural sciences, I'm also very into computers, and I've dabbled a  bit in programming. More recently, I've started to research and look  into how computer science is starting to bleed into and be a desired in  the various natural science fields, and I guess what I'm kind of  wondering is, would these two degrees together be desired? would the  skillets acquired from both serve me well in the job market? A big  factor in why I'm considering this is because Biochemistry, similar to  CS requires a lot of sciences, and this semester I'm taking calculus 2,  which will be the final, math class I need for Biochemistry.

I'm a Cloud Architect with 6 years experience. I recently moved to a new position which requires little architecting at a different company. My new position is mainly a project management role.

How difficult would it be for me to get back into architecting after a 2-3 year break? I intend on keeping my certs up to date (Google Prof, AWS Prof, etc.)

My current role is a part of the cloud development team and I originally picked it because I want to develop my project management skills, however, I feel as qualified and competent as the CS's I work with and essentially that's where I would like to go back to.

Any path I could follow?",cscareerquestions,1636468820
31,Should I join any company I could as a fresh graduate?,"Should I take any offer available as a fresh graduate.
I am currently studying at a bottom tier college in India
1semester is left and companies are hiring already average paying around 3-4 lakh per year.

However most of them are not really product based but service based handling clients. But my question is whether I should join whatever one I get selected into regardless of what technology  its about like testing, Salesforce etc or maybe apply outside of campus placements to look into other opportunities (the chances of that are thin however because many ask for experience, when I read on their websites).

I haven't done leetcode and am not very good at data structures at the moment but I am wondering if I should or should not work on it as my classmates who are selected are joining into whichever company they can and they are mainly being asked basic type of questions and I am feeling like I'm falling behind.

Once you join most of them have a bond of around 2 years and college is not allowing to go for other ones if you are selected for one company.

One of my superiors actually mentioned that ""it's better to write bug-free, good code rather than fast code"" and i was ""too much in a hurry"". This isn't mentioned often though, he just told it once. And i feel like he himself, like many other people in the company writes code bad and fast because of lack of  employees.

Both offers also have individual performance bonus.            


I am not really sure what I want to do as a career step. After exploring options, I had convinced myself I wanted to do consulting ( client-facing, different work all day, growth opportunities in career, help in getting to manager type jobs quickly) but then suddenly this offer came and the money seems too good to say no to.           
From what I have read online, the data analyst role has terrible reviews with people complaining nothing to learn and the company will kill your youth. Surrounded by only old people and that the only young people around you are the others in the rotation. It sounded a whole lot depressing.            

I would generally sell my soul to any corporation who is ready to pay me more. (My sole reason to work is money). But I feel restricting myself to a role with seemingly no growth option is a stupid choice in the beginning.

59,"First dev job, 3 month review has me nervous","Hey all, 

Just had a 3 month review at my first developer job today and I will say that it left me feeling uneasy. This is a startup and a small team that is growing quickly (was 6 devs when I hired, already at 9 now). My role is full stack, and have recently moved to a newly created team, with some tickets still working their way through QA from the old team I am basically working in 2 teams at once. If you'd asked me yesterday how I felt about my performance I would have said I felt like I was thriving and quickly learning. I have worked some large, difficult tickets (20-100 files changed), added several features everyone was excited about and built up a good understanding of the frameworks and languages. I am already mentoring some of the new hires in their first few tickets, in fact.

By way of positive feedback, I was told they were very happy with the code reviews I give other developers and that I do a very thorough job testing - the truth is I'm only being as thorough as my tickets are treated. By bad news, I was told that my tickets are taking a long time to get through QA / going through a lot of feedback / correction iterations and tickets aren't being done in a timely manner. Up until this point I just assumed a lot of back and forth was normal and that the senior devs use GitHub reviews as a teaching tool - at least that is how I've been thinking of it. But it is clear now that others higher up in the company consider it a sort of KPI. 

I'm now on my 3rd team lead and asked him point blank how nervous I should be about this review (follow up in 2 weeks) - walking him through the work I was doing on my current ticket which is a bit of a bear by the admission of the seniors. The expectation this fortnightly sprint is to finish that and maybe 1-2 more tickets. He assured me after following the work I've done and talking over the process that I should be OK but part of me wants to start brushing up on the resume and sending out applications. 

It took me a lot to get to this point, this job has had a positive impact in my life and a lot is depending on it continuing for the next few years until I can erase the ""junior"" and just put ""developer"".

I spent 1 and a half hours answering one question only to get half the test cases correct. I spent all my time for that one problem and couldn’t hope to answer anything else. I’m six months out of college this month after graduating from a state school with a BA in CS &amp; Econ (double major).

I’ve been working on my generalized anxiety disorder including SAD for over a decade and it’s cost me and my family time and money supporting me. My parents are in their mid 60s to early 70s, but still want to support me and wish to send me to graduate school for a MS in CS. I want to go, but the anxieties of adulthood (emergency fund, car, savings, wanting parents to enjoy their golden years) are catching up to me. At my current pace however, I don’t see any employers taking me on unless the interviewer takes pity on me.

I don’t know if I’m that person to completely rewrite their lifestyle in six months, but if the past six months were any example I’m not even close. Without the feedback of academia and grades, I’m at a loss as to whether or not the skills I’m building are sufficient to be even applying for jobs or if I should give up for 3-4 months and find any full time job that will take me. The minor progress I’ve made from interview to interview is weeks and months in between; I’ve had 3-4 technical interviews including the 2 in person interviews that I completely failed after about 150 applications. When a family member offered to given a reference to google, I stayed the course and studied hard for six weeks but after receiving crickets the motivation to continue disappeared.

I have a part time job in sales that I start soon, and I hate myself for it. Why did I go to college to get a part time job I could have gotten without the degree? I need a full time job yesterday, not some part time gig. Should I just go for a life insurance job and settle in the meantime, and risk getting locked into that?

66,Salary (Raise vs Job Offer) Advice,"I currently work as a software engineer for a small/medium-sized DoD tech contractor in Huntsville, Alabama.

I have worked for this company since graduation (B.S.) first as an intern, then as full-time.

I have been working there for 2.5 years. When I was first promoted to full-time, my base pay was $60K. At the time, I was living/working in Mississippi (low cost of living). After about 1 year there, I was offered a transfer to the company’s office in Huntsville for a raise to $70K, although TBH in hindsight this was little more than a cost of living pay adjustment.

Since then, I have received 3% and 4% annual performance increases during performance review cycle, the most recent of which was only a month ago, which lands my current salary at roughly $75K.

I cannot help but think that I am now being payed below market value. I have received excellent performance reviews, and I have taken on a fair bit of responsibility over the last year. I would probably think that I should speak with my supervisor about a raise, but seeing as I just received a raise a month ago and hadn’t asked for a raise then, I’m just not sure whether there’s a good way to do this.

I have also put in some applications elsewhere and have an interview scheduled later in the week and am hoping I can get an offer for around $85K-$90K. But I’m very happy at my current job and would only be moving for the money.

Overall I like my team, and the job isn't horrible, but the work is a lot slower than I expected and the code quality is a little iffy sometimes. I feel like if I stay in this role I'm going to stagnate and the longer I stay the more I'm cheating myself out of experience. 

Not only that, the cost of living in my area is rising significantly (rent went up 20% across my region in one year despite Covid) and I know my company most likely won't be able to give me a cost of living increase that even scratches the surface of that. I like this area and really don't want to get priced out...

I recently had a FAANG recruiter in my area reach out to me and I'll be have my first round technical interview in a couple of weeks. Despite studying I'm not expecting much to come of that, but hey maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised? 

So far, I'm looking through job postings and it's pretty hard to find roles for people like me who have about a year to a year and a half's experience.

I dont know if I have it in me to find a job before quitting this one.

I joined my company 2 years ago and joined my current team 1.5 years around. While joining, they interviewed me to gauge if I was a good fit for the current team and they kept me. I was quite surprised to know that almost all other devs were 10+ years experienced and I was told when I asked if I could learn anything that, it'll be ""on the job learning"". Due to few teammates and their own workload I had very less time to learn and currently in a situation where I dont know if I can even do my job anymore. I wanted to quit an year ago when I realised that the situation wouldn't improve but the anxiety about me not knowing almost anything I cant even apply for jobs. All the hours I get outside my work are spent either trying to learn something relevant and solidifying it or stressing about it. And I cant even handle that proper. Work just seems to suck out any energy left that I can barely concentrate.

Does anyone else has relevant experience about quitting as inexperienced dev for a new place? I dont even think I like this field anymore. Or maybe my feeling about that are exaggerated due to bad work experience and anxiety.

Inside a big corporate we get like 100-200 resumes / day for each vacancy. You read that right. Per day! 

To top it all I've seen volunteers in almost all CSR activities teaching everyone how to code. Be it orphanage (""because they can join the IT""), the elderly (""because it's good for their brains"") and the housewives (""make money from home with remote IT jobs"").

That includes people who could have one day been doctors, professors, lawyers, administrators, constructors. There's this movement to sell everyone the dream of joining IT and making big bucks.

Whenever the common man asks me what job I do and I say ""IT"" he immediately assumes that I must be filthy rich, jumping into a swimming pool full of money and making cigars out of currency notes.

We are churning out a hell load of graduates every year who have a degree in comp-science and/or IT and 80% of them will never get into the IT industry. And I've seen a shitload of Youtube videos/articles that are centered around ""stuck in your job, move to IT"". A friend of mine was fed up of his job in the medicinal field and was asking me how he can become an IT manager (in the US). He put in some fake experience and secured a job.

Is it time to stop encouraging non-IT people to join the IT stream? We had an IT boss who came over from manufacturing industry who brought with him horrible manufacturing-centered work-culture (like discipline in office timings in spite of flexible hours policy) and zero domain/technical knowledge. We had almost every employee quit the job from under him due to his rudeness.

How much more are we going to keep encouraging every Tom, Dick and Harry the IT dream? I mean come on! There are a hell load of other professions that are also doing good and where you can make an good living. Like accountancy or business or manufacturing or civil or federal or argricuture.

They say that only the math-intensive works are worth doing. Only the high earners who work in FAANG or quant companies are respectable. That computer science is developing the maths and algorithms, and just using them is not CS. Not CS = not as smart = not as respectable.

I make the fix and submit it. My fix is within the scope of the bug, and addresses the issue. The team seems to agree, minus a senior dev. 

Senior dev wants to completely rewrite some things that are related, but outside the scope of this bug. New features. While the new features would *help* performance, their main goal is to do something else.  

In the standup, i somewhat tersely tell the senior developer that I'm not making those changes and that if they want those changes to file a ticket, which us developers do often. I haven't said it out loud yet, but there's a high chance of regression or new bugs with the features, and they aren't necessary to fix the bug. 

Given the ticket status was 'in code review', my boss simply said that someone needs to take a look at it and moved on. 

For context, i have 1/10th the experience he does, so I'm much newer. Senior dev is 3rd most experienced out of a team of 10. I'm 6th most experienced.  Was i out of line when i told the senior dev that the solution they suggested was not part of my ticket? Should i just suck it up and do the work anyway?

91,Started My Fist CS Job and I'm Struggling,"Hey everyone,

This post is more for venting but any advice would be helpful!

I started my first CS job doing development several months ago and I'm still really struggling. I was hired on knowing that I had no knowledge in ReactJS and that was perfectly fine. When I started I took a crash course in React. I then began working on bugs for several months without using any of the course knowledge. 

Ever since I have been given tickets to actually build code I have been struggling to complete them. 75% of the time I'm staring at my screen wondering what the hell is even going on because I just can't wrap my head around the code and the issues I'm having. I feel like I have been heavily relying on my team to walk me through errors and bugs to the point where I'm thinking they're starting to get frustrated with me.

I sometimes go 24 hours without a response to a question. In the time gap I google and watch every video possible to help with my issue. I have gotten to the point where I'm working 10-11 hours a day to get tickets completed on time and sometimes it still isn't enough. It's really starting affecting life outside of work whether I'm tired or constantly on edge because of how frustrating it can be struggling all day with no progress made. 

I know to watch out for imposter syndrome and have been able to recognize that this isn't the case. I know this because tickets that should be taking half a sprint are taking me 1.5-2 sprints to complete which is unacceptable. I could probably finish them much quicker if I had access to faster responses but then I'm worried I'll be relying on others more than I already am.

After all the hard work of graduating in the top of my class, going through several internships, and working so hard to land this job, it all feels like it was a waste of time and that I'm in over my head.

94,Need some career advice,"Here goes nothing. It has been 7 months since I started my first job as a junior software developer at a mid sized company. During the initial interview process I was asked very surface level technical questions, with no programming questions. The vibe I got from the interview was for them to see if I have general programming knowledge and if I am willing to learn, both of which are true. 

During the first 1-1.5 months of work I was paired with another team member who helped me setup my dev environment and give me a brief overview of the project. Afterwards that team member was assigned to a different project. For the following 3 months or so I was working on the project I was introduced to (debugging, minor improvements, etc.) with the so called project architect being my boss. I felt like my boss had a very clear vision for the project and was able to gauge his developers skill level accurately &amp; he was someone who I could go to to have general questions answered, since I no longer had another dev assigned to me. 

However, about two months ago my  boss changed roles within the company, and my company brough on a  project manager as the new team lead. Since joining, it has become obvious that my new boss has no technical managerial experience, and he does not understand the project scope &amp; he is not able to answer any technical questions. That being said, I still have no one assigned to me to answer questions, and I feel like I have been left completely stranded to figure things out on my own. 

I have sensed that things have started to get a bit out of hand now since my new boss is treating all the developer's skill levels as equal since he has no technical experience himself or gauge for our skill levels. Currently I am assigned a task that would have been assigned to either a standard software dev or senior under my old boss. Without going into too much detail, the task at hand involves building out waitlist functionality for user registrations &amp; system to send out emails when a user is registered. 

I am doing my best to get the ask done, by learning a lot of JavaScript concepts on the fly and in my personal time &amp; Angular (both of which I hadn't touched prior to starting work here). A lot of the time after hitting a dead end for about an hour or two with a problem, I reach out to 1-2 senior dev's I met who are nice and helpful, but I end up taking several hours of their time working out my problem, and they are not even assigned to me, so I feel like I cannot make that a regular thing.

I am enjoying getting some hands on experience and learning, but I feel like I am not getting the best experience with that, since I am tasked with tickets over my head to which I am forced to focus on finishing on time, rather than spending quality time to learn the tools which I am using. There is simply no training of any sorts I have received other than the initial big scope project intro, and I am left to hopefully just figure it out. 

 I do not want succumb to being assigned tasks which are over my head &amp; have to keep going to senior devs for help. My new boss just cares about if the ask is done, not how its done, unlike my old boss who definitely treated me more like a junior &amp; gave me a leaning opportunity. Should I be looking for new jobs? How do I move get past this?

I was hoping on staying at my current role for at least a year (5 more moths), which by then I'll have graduated with my MSCS, and have 1.5 years Software Dev experience under my belt.

By way of introduction, I'm WallStResumeWriter - I've been fortunate enough to land a front-office job at a top bank on Wall Street (apologies for the anonymity, never know who's reading this!). Candidly, getting here was a challenge - I interviewed with, many leading bulge bracket investment banks and couldn't figure out why I kept getting rejected. 

To get my current job, I had an epiphany that I needed to find new ways to stand out from the pack of candidates, especially as I didn't have the good fortune of coming from a top school. I figured out an optimal resume format, new ways to apply and highly differentiated ways to answer interview questions. In fact, when I interviewed with my current company, they had told me they were so impressed that they ended up waving the pre-hire modeling exam and I skipped both rounds of interviews with HR! (yes, seriously...)

After getting my job, I volunteered to help others at my university - I helped students write highly differentiated resumes, get interviews, prepare for interviews and write excellent thank-you notes. After helping land several students jobs, I realized I might be on to something.

At my current job, I decided to volunteer to help with recruitment. After going through hundreds of resumes and being on the other side of the process, I have a really good understanding of what banks are looking for and how to stand out/get in. 

Entrepreneurship is something I'm passionate about and have always wanted to start a business. With that, I've decided to try my hand at writing resumes and coaching for those trying to break in. Whether you're in college trying to land your junior year internship or first full-time position, or already working and looking to lateral in from big four, management consulting or other areas of finance, I'm confident I can help you. I can also help those trying to get into big four (I landed a full-time offer with one of them in advisory).

My initial thoughts are that I'd like to charge $100 to do a custom resume from scratch, or will charge $30 for a 30 minute call. My thinking is that to build a strong resume, it'll take \~2 hours, possibly more depending on the person, plus I'll need to do a bit of back and forth to ensure I've incorporated everything. I figure $50 per hour is fair and reasonable. If you are interested, I'd be happy to chat/message before you commit to using my service. And for those seriously interested, I'd be happy to provide examples of my work and more on my background (what bank, school, gpa, etc.).

If interested or have any questions, please email me at [WallStResumeWriter@gmail.com](mailto:WallStResumeWriter@gmail.com).

As a final thing, I understand that many of you reading are probably not convinced of the value this service provides. $100 is a lot of money. I agree with that. But, I truly believe the value I can bring is worth it. I do believe that I can seriously improve your chances of getting your resume pulled from the pile - after all, I've been responsible for pulling resumes at my current job - I know what to look for!

Candidly, getting here was a challenge - I interviewed with, many leading bulge bracket investment banks and couldn't figure out why I kept getting rejected. 

To get my current job, I had an epiphany that I needed to find new ways to stand out from the pack of candidates, especially as I didn't have the good fortune of coming from a top school. I figured out an optimal resume format, new ways to apply and highly differentiated ways to answer interview questions. In fact, when I interviewed with my current company, they had told me they were so impressed that they ended up waving the pre-hire modeling exam and I skipped both rounds of interviews with HR! (yes, seriously...)

After getting my job, I volunteered to help others at my university - I helped students write highly differentiated resumes, get interviews, prepare for interviews and write excellent thank-you notes. After helping land several students jobs, I realized I might be on to something.

At my current job, I decided to volunteer to help with recruitment. After going through hundreds of resumes and being on the other side of the process, I have a really good understanding of what banks are looking for and how to stand out/get in. 

Entrepreneurship is something I'm passionate about and have always wanted to start a business. With that, I've decided to try my hand at writing resumes and coaching for those trying to break in. Whether you're in college trying to land your junior year internship or first full-time position, or already working and looking to lateral in from big four, management consulting or other areas of finance, I'm confident I can help you. I can also help those trying to get into big four (I landed a full-time offer with one of them in advisory).

My initial thoughts are that I'd like to charge $100 to do a custom resume from scratch, or will charge $30 for a 30 minute call. My thinking is that to build a strong resume, it'll take \~2 hours, possibly more depending on the person, plus I'll need to do a bit of back and forth to ensure I've incorporated everything. I figure $50 per hour is fair and reasonable. If you are interested, I'd be happy to chat/message before you commit to using my service. And for those seriously interested, I'd be happy to provide examples of my work and more on my background (what bank, school, gpa, etc.).

If interested or have any questions, please email me at [WallStResumeWriter@gmail.com](mailto:WallStResumeWriter@gmail.com).

As a final thing, I understand that many of you reading are probably not convinced of the value this service provides. $100 is a lot of money. I agree with that. But, I truly believe the value I can bring is worth it. I do believe that I can seriously improve your chances of getting your resume pulled from the pile - after all, I've been responsible for pulling resumes at my current job - I know what to look for! I do believe I can get you prepared to navigate technical questions. And I do believe that I can help you to get interviewers to remember you.

Thanks for reading. I look forward to hopefully working with some of you!",cscareerquestions,1636425738

I want to get into cyber security. It's something that's always interested me, and my friend sent me this [article](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/28/america-faces-a-cybersecurity-skills-crisis-microsoft-launches-national-campaign-to-help-community-colleges-expand-the-cybersecurity-workforce/) the other day about how we need more cyber security people.

On the other hand, programming is way more flexible. I can build my own things, work on my own time. I can prove what I know by having an impressive Github page. It just feels way more my speed.

Honestly I left my last jobb after 6 years (just basic IT stuff) cause it didn't pay enough. I'm trying to change careers so I can be happy and make more money.

When I’ve been interviewing with other companies they say that I only qualify for entry level positions but have been working at my current job for two years. I don’t want to stay where I’ll constantly be behind but I’m either underselling what I do or I’m stuck in a loop of not having enough relevant experience for going to another company without a pay cut.

I make around $100,000 currently. I was given $20,000 in bonuses, but I would have to forfeit most of those bonuses for leaving the company early.

I’d obviously like to make a higher salary at the startup – the startup initially said that $130,000 was the ballpark with no bonuses.

Could I potentially negotiate a higher salary, given that I’m forfeiting my bonuses? I don’t want to overstep or anything but this seems logical to me.",cscareerquestions,1636423599

The company has seen a lot of attrition lately (hot job market I guess), so, six months ago, they offered me a retention bonus of $26k if I stayed for a full year.   

The job is fine, with good benefits and work life balance. I don't get a ton of guidance and it's a little slow at times, I feel like most people coast here. I also had my end of year performance review and I'm being submitted for a promotion, plus a nice bonus (likely around $9k, paid in March.).

- 85k salary. With OT I make about 90. 
- 5 Weeks vacation. 
- Tenured.

- High stress. 
- No room for further growth. I’m at the highest pay scale.

28,Drafting an email as we speak asking my boss for a significant raise. Last minute tips or pep talks?,"You can skip to the last line for the main question, but there's a lot of context needed if you want the full picture so I included more than I needed to. you may skip if you wish. 

I am a software developer for one of the top 4 largest (in number of employees) employers in my state (trying to be vague for a reason). 

My qualifications: I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from an ABET engineering program. I had zero real world programming experience and no internships. Graduated right smack dab in the height of the pandemic. There were plenty of jobs technically, but recruiting efforts in my area were slow. It ended up taking me nearly 11 months to find a job (well, 13 months until I was formally hired, my hiring process took a while because they had to create the position for me). 

I make... much MUCH less many than any other software developer I've ever spoken to. My peers who are all software engineers in the same area started at 60-65k (1 made 70k, and one lucky bastard started out at 80k). 

I make 45k total compensation. My work is... in that grey area between being public sector and private sector. Its a private institution that gets a majority of their money from state and federal governments. Not so much a contractor, i guess you could peripherally say we're related to education. 

So I anticipated taking SOME compensation penalty. Anything that is considered technically a nonprofit associated with the government is going to have great benefits, a great retirement plan, but less than competitive wages. 

But I wasn't ready for 45,000. When I was given the job offer, 1) I was desperate, and 2) I was lead to believe that I would be allowed to do overtime. Doing the numbers, even a few extra hours a week of overtime would make the difference. we have a 37.5 hour work week. If i worked even 42 hours a week, it would make a drastic improvement to my bottom line. 

The first time I went 30 minutes over my weekly time (it was my first week and I missed an unpaid lunch break because I didn't know how it worked yet) and I got a message telling me I had to redo my time sheet to reflect a 37.5 hour week, and that I could just go home 30 minutes early one day the next week. So there wasn't any wage theft, but it was VERY clearl I would not be getting any over time. 

So now, I'm paying 850 dollar a month in private student loans, and federal loans are coming up next year in like february. I won't be able to afford them. 

I'm not going to go the route of making a case for why I'm WORTH more money. I'm a ""programmer level 2"" at my work. Its technically a 2 year experience position but they gave it to me with 0. the compensation range is 28.5k to 59k. 

I organically steered a conversation with my boss a few weeks ago towards programmer level 3, and he said that it was a 5 year experience position, and that he could probably get hr to approve it after 2. I cannot wait 2 years. 

I can't even wait to hit my 6 months (I started in june so I'm coming up on my 5 months in a few days). I certainly cannot wait until whenever they do yearly reviews (I requested a manual review once after 3 months and my boss indicated my performance was satisfactory (he said if I had a clone he'd hire the clone). 

My boss when he hired me pushed for the most money hr would allow him to pay me. Since the position was for 2 years of experience and I had 0, the most he could get was 45k (minimum was 28). 

Max is 59. 

I don't want to go the route of ""i'm worth this much because...."". I want to be honest with him. After taxes I make 2800 dollars a month on average, but because of the 14 day pay period, I maybe have more or less paychecks on any given month so some months I'll only get 2400. 1000 dollar's I pay on rent alone. Factor in 850 a month on loans, 400 on groceries (I live in a high cost of living city and am starting out in my first apartment, there are a lot of necessary first time transactions. I can't afford to buy in bulk either or food will be wasted). 

I was going back and forth on whether or not I should apply somewhere else, get an offer, and use that to leverage my boss for a promotion. I don't really know if that's a good idea. that might come across aggressive. I like this place. Good work life balance, I actually learn shit (which I was afraid I wouldn't). Tasks are created for me to bolster my skillset. 

I don't want to just walk into my boss's office. We have a good rapport and I'm not particularly a nervous person, but I don't want to put him on the spot, and I want to be able to make my entire case before he can respond. I know it might not be up to him. 

Is there anything else I should do? Should I reconsider all of this? Any advice?",cscareerquestions,1636418969
29,A question for those who have been programming for a long time,"So, I've recently found out that typing on keyboards with short key travel / are not really well engineered in terms of ergonomics can lead to some seriously bad arthritis, and it's got me quite concerned, especially since my fingers have started hurting as of late.

I've been using the Logitech K380 for about two years now, and out of the keyboards I've used in my lifetime, it's one of the keyboards with the lowest key travel. It's also not that mushy when typing on (maybe that's just because I've been using it for so long), so I end up impacting my fingers quite a bit, but I've relied on it for so long because it's such a portable keyboard.

Should I invest on getting a new keyboard? If so, I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend me something that'd be great for typing on in the long haul. One keyboard I have in mind is the Logitech MX Keys, as it seems like a lot of people are saying that it's really comfortable to type on, but I'd love to hear someone's take on what they think of the keyboard after having used it for a while.

The voicemail he left was muffled so I couldn't hear everything, especially all the important info, mentioned something would be in the email and offer letter, not sure what because it cut out. I called that number back but it went to voicemail, and I sent an email to the talent recruiter, haven't heard back. Granted I'm being paranoid, however, I was accepted into a smaller company before, and they ghosted me so just a lil worried. 

Also on the voicemail he pronounced my name incorrectly Ex: If my name is Christian, he called me Christina. Although, my phone number has a lot of the same repeating digit, so he would've had to double check my phone number. 

Moreover, on the job portal, it now says ""Closed"" for the application I applied. Not sure what that can mean tbh. Also ik im being paranoid, and that I should just be patient, but would like to hear what you guys think.",cscareerquestions,1636413656

49,Recruiters withholding information,"What is it with recruiters withholding from potential clients? I'm not asking for much but I'm often contacted by recruiters who refuse to give basic information like the name of the company (so I can look more into what their trade/industry is), job title, requirements/expectations of the candidate and tech stack.   


Knowing the name of the company for me to look up is often the first big filter for me to gauge interest and avoid wasting both my time and the recruiters time. I don't want to work for your mortgage company for example so I'd kindly pass on your request to discuss further, but simply telling me ""We don't divulge client information with people we haven't spoken with"" is a major turn off and honestly gives me a feeling of distrust from the recruiter. I'm not in it to go around them to apply directly, which I've also had a recruiter use that excuse to hide information from me.  


So what's with it? Why is there this mentality of hiding basic information in hopes that some poor sap (likely desperate for work) actually bites the hook.

56,Unsure about if I should leave or not,"I just started a new job as php developer a week ago. I've been working as web developer for quite a while, started in 2007, know my way around, also did some react, vue, nextjs, graphql stuff and played with laravel (lumen), symfony and the like. The new job I started has some weird stuff going on, I don't know if I should leave or give it a try:

- they don't use PSR standards, no PSR 1, 12 and 4, to mention the most common ones. 
- they don't even have a template engine, they want me to write everything in one file. they have an internal framework though, they seem to be very proud of. although one of the developers who has been there for a few years told me, the first thing he did back in 2014 was to introduce them to gulp and jquery and to store hashed passwords in their database.
- they don't have a controller
- they force me to use tools rather than giving me the opportunity to use the tools i feel comfy with: for instance, i like to use `tig` as git client, but I feel like they don't want me to use anything command line (arch user inside me cries)
- their deployment strategy looks like this: you've to insert the filepaths you added or changed by hand, and add the changed lines by hand too. the same thing has to be done for database migrations. i've to enter the tables and columns i changed into a webform and their release software delivers it. i feel so bad about it, they already use git, but remember all tables and columns I changed sucks
- their whole code base feels like it is stuck in 2012, whenever some of the developers wants to change something, they (the bosses) say they can't, for historical reasons
- they don't use composer or npm, they want to write everything on their own, if you want to use a dependency, they are going to tell you all sorts of reasons why it is bad to do so and why their own tools are better (even if they're not)
- `box-sizing: border-box` isn't allowed for historical reasons, the code doesn't really feel clean to me, they are not really into DRY, some of the devs wanted to `return $this` in a few methods so they can chain them and not have to call all kind of setter methods on the object.
- I don't really get why they ""spam"" so many setter Methods on the public interface, why can't they offer to add all those settings in one way when creating the object with a constructor. I guess if I want to add an additional constructor signature, they're going to kill me literally

So I don't really know if I should stick to it, maybe I'm to needy and feel superior, maybe I've no right to argue with them while I still identify myself as junior developer. But is it too much desired, to have a template engine in 2021?",cscareerquestions,1636411318

I am good at speaking to people, which is why the recruiter would like me to interview, since they mentioned that a lot of my CS  student colleagues struggle with that. That being said, the idea of customer interaction stresses me because that sort of interaction takes a lot out of me and is exhausting.

I finally landed a junior software developer job this month and today was my first day. Man today was completely overwhelming... Everything is currently remote due to covid. I was in a call at the start of my shift with my manager and other new hires. He explained the company and the project goals to us. Then said we can get started and ended the call. There were two GitHub repositories that had set up instructions, so I followed them and set it up. There were some problems with set up along the way, but I was able to fix the issues. There were no further instructions or tasks. So I asked what I should do next and he says get familiar with the codebase then ask for a task. So I spend the rest of the day looking through the code by myself. It's a HUGE codebase. I've never worked on something big like this before. I don't know how to familiarize myself with the codebase when I don't even know where to start looking. I've never used many of the technologies that they're using. There is so much that is foreign to me, I started stressing out bad.  As a junior developer, I was hoping for more guidance from senior developers. I was hoping I would be learning on a call while working together. But it seems that we're expected to already know everything and just hop in and get started coding.

However, I also got offered a remote internship role at PagerDuty for $2.50 more than what I’m getting paid at SAP for the upcoming semester.

Sometimes days are okay, I like taking small, easy, necessary tasks and feel most comfortable here.

I was curious to how often, do you guys n gals consume cannabis? One of my developer friends from college says he now uses canna during work, everyday, since he is fully remote and supposedly its not affecting his performance. I personally started to get back into consuming cannabis after a hell week at work  but only use during the evenings, so my consumption is probably coupe of times a week after work and I feel like Im getting the hang of the balance again ( my anxiety was through the roof because of hell week at work and I had stopped consuming cannabis for a year+ due to covid n resp. issues, and now returning to canna basically made me feel like my normal self without any anxiety)

93,CS Degree or Bootcamp for an Engineering Grad,"Hello Everyone,

I have recently completed an undergrad degree in Chemical Engineering and I'm wondering if it would make sense for me to do a coding boot camp or a 2nd degree. I'm leaning towards a boot camp as I already have experience with MATLAB and Python and I'm halfway through EdX's CS50 course (in other words programming is not completely new to me). My goals mainly revolve around getting into the industry as fast as possible so I don't feel like I need to go through the whole college experience again. On the other hand, I'm not really sure which area of CS I want to get into so a degree might make it easier to figure this out (web-dev seems pretty hot but I'm not sure). Additionally, I'm worried about the depth of knowledge between CS grads and bootcamp grads and I wonder if this will can present some problems in trying to find employment.

Still haven't heard from the recruiter. I wrote late last week and haven't gotten a reply yet. I'm still in ""interviewing"" status in my applicant portal, though, so I don't think they've rejected me but I don't know if these portals are absolutely foolproof. The process has been slow and so has this recruiter; the department is hiring for multiple roles at the same time and the recruiter had let me know they hoped that wouldn't slow things down during my process. The panel is not the last stage - I know there are more stages, so I'm waiting to hear if I'm advancing (they told me what the next steps would be when scheduling my panel).

Every bit of info I can find about this is people talking about having no personal or professional experience and being fully trained even though their degree has no relation to CS/programming, but when I look up interview/entry processes via Glassdoor they seem to REQUIRE you to have a grasp on OOP, Java, html/css concepts to get through even the interview portion which contradicts all of these posts.

99,Currently majoring in accounting and thinking of transitioning to comp sci- help!,"Okay a little bit of background. I’m in my junior year and I’ll have my bachelors in 1 year. I enjoy accounting and learning about business, but a lot of what I enjoy is using spreadsheets (excel) to automate data.

This is basically simplified coding. I’m thinking I want to transition into comp sci for 3 reasons:

1) Job pay. I enjoy both accounting and I’m assuming I will enjoy computer science based off of what I have read and done

2) Time and cost. As an accounting major getting your CPA is basically mandatory. This is a 500+ hour exam that will take 4+ months

3) Hours. Accountants are famously overworked. From what I’ve read in public we work 60+ hours a week and private 40-50. Keep in mind we don’t get overtime

I also want to add that computer programming is notorious for being done from home. This is possible with accounting but it really doesn’t seem like the industry is heading in that direction.

Anyway, I’m not sure what to do but I’m really thinking about either doing a minor program in comp sci or doing a programming boot camp with the money I would save from dropping out of classes. 

My question is what should I do? Should I just finish my accounting degree then go the self taught route? Should I drop and start pursuing programming full time? Any advice would be great. Thank you!",cscareerquestions,1636401915

I feel there's a lot to achieve in the company however I consistently sense a lack of ownership and initiative from my colleagues. Mostly all of them stick to their tasks and at times even slack off on them and when something breaks rarely someone would raise their hand to help debug the issue. In the absence of the manager, it's as if people are just present on slack and many times there's no response to questions/suggestions. 

The seniormost developer of the team is a great programmer (better than all of us and knows the most about the product) however he is very laidback and replies/helps out only when he is in the mood even if there is a production issue.

4,How soon before being able to relocate should I search for a remote software dev job?,"\-I am a software dev with 5 YoE and am currently working in-person in Seattle

\-I live with my spouse (no kids) who is in college. She graduates in August.

\-My spouse and I want to move to Houston TX. I want to get a remote software dev job before relocating to Houston. She can't move until August at the earliest. I could technically move as soon as I get a remote software dev job but it would be convenient if we moved at the same time.

\-My spouse would ideally try to have her first job out of college to be in Houston (August/September start date)

**With this in mind, how soon before being ready to move should I start searching for a remote software dev job? How common is it to get a remote software job but not relocate until a few months into working the job?**

Some options I see:

* I start job searching 2-4 months before August with the intent of having an August start date. This way, I relocate to Houston in August with my spouse right after she graduates. This would be great but the downside is that giving myself less time to job search means I might not get a remote job offer by August.
* I start job searching many months before August (maybe start in January or a little later). This makes it more likely that I will have a remote job offer by August. In this scenario, my start date might be before August depending on how early I get an offer (because I can't ask for a start date that is 7 months out I assume). If my start date is before August, I'd see if the company would let me start working remote from Seattle and then I move to Houston in August with my spouse. If they don't allow that, I could move to Houston by myself after accepting the offer and then be separated from my spouse until she graduates in August (not ideal but it is an option).",cscareerquestions,1636400817

I spent 3 years at a 2-year community college where I switched to CS after 1 year. I had one semester left before graduating last spring when I dropped out because I had some ADHD and discipline and just generally didn't want to try at anything. 

Anyway, that's recently not a problem anymore so I've been more focused on having a career. After I dropped out, I moved to Minnesota and worked at Activision as a QA Tester for a year before that ended. I've been unemployed since that ended this last summer. 

Before I moved, I had one unpaid web dev internship for about 5 months which I quit to be a tester because  I needed money. 

I've been applying to jobs pretending I completed my degree but recently realized it's probably not a good idea. I've been doing code academy React and Front-End Engineer paths and want to be a front-end dev. I'm also interested in game dev 

The options I've come up with is to either 

* Keep doing online courses and full-fledged personal projects while working retail or similar
* Do a boot camp
* Take out loans to finish my 2 year or transfer to 4 year (I owe $2000 in loans from my previous degree) (I'm not sure how much I would get in aid, I'm 23 and married to a Chemical Engineer that recently graduated)

9,University taught DS&amp;A minimally. I have no idea what to do,"New grad. I’m already in a job and am aiming to pursue a masters, but due to lack of anything to boost my application (need to apply for a scholarship as well as the course itself), I’m spending the next few years doing courses and personal projects, hoping to beef up my application. With this masters, I am hoping to become a machine learning engineer in the future.

All the talk about LC and DS&amp;A has got me very worried about my knowledge of those topics. At university, my course didn’t really teach much, if anything, about DS&amp;A besides how to use them in programming and some algorithms for data science and ML. We didn’t have to implement any data structures in C or get tested on time/space complexity. Most of what I learned was the other concepts (compilers, operating systems, programming, and data science), so naturally what little I learned was pushed aside. I also underestimated how important DS&amp;A was, so it’s importance didn’t really occur to me until now.

Now that I’ve graduated, I’ve realised that I have a pathetic amount of knowledge of DS&amp;A and I have no idea what I should do - if I should just forget about it for now or if I should relearn everything. My current job is more data analysis than SWE, so there’s not much need for either, but I’m worried that as I prepare for my masters, complete it, and eventually land a job, it’s going to catch up with me and I’ll be fucked.

It's exactly what most people would expect from a government job: Extremely laid back, supervisors don't care about anything, stable and great money for the amount of work that we do. The problem is I've always had bigger goals for myself. When I first took this job, I told myself that I would just stay for a year or so, then take the clearance and jump to the private sector. However, I've been so comfortable here that I kept making excuses to stay. Right now I'm telling myself that I'll just stay one more year or so to work on a part time master's degree before leaving...

I think my biggest problem is just the fear of being less skilled than my peers in the private sector and the loss of workplace comfort. I'm in a management position right now and I highly doubt I'll be able to land an equal position in the private sector. For fields like consulting, I'd probably have to start as a junior analyst with a bunch of fresh college grads. 

I really want to make the switch to private sector to gain new skills, make more money and generally just ""move up in the world"". I really don't want to be a typical fed who coasts along, doing nothing for 30 years until pension time. Not that there's anything wrong with that of course...

Recently I got fired from the client (in Europe), that I started working with in last September, and now I'm in my 1 month of notice period.  
back in last August, my employer (small consulting company) presented my CV to this client and lied about my availability date. at that time I was already working for a big Bank, I spent +1 year there, but I got sick from the old technologies they use.  
the new client (the one that fired me) needed me to start asap, so during all September and half of October, I started working for the new client while doing my 1 month of notice with the old client. It was extremely stressful and there were many times were I  had to do multiple meeting at the same time.  


before I start with the new client, my employer warned me that they had high expectations, and if I survive the first 2 weeks of trial period, I'm good. and I did survive the first 2 weeks despite working 2 full time jobs, even their feedback came out positive. mid October, when I'm done with the first client, I thought that I can finally go back to normal, but 2 weeks later, a manager calls me at 9 AM asking me about how I'm feeling in the team etc, I thought It was a normal feedback call, until he tells me that I'm fired because of performance issues and that I'm not integrated in the team.  


the truth is that I never went past the the deadline, and even if it did happen once, it was because of issues like inconsistencies in the spec written by the analysts, or techlead (who gave the bad feedback about me) wants to handle everything, and he's making a huge bottleneck where code reviews take days. But even if I did a mistake, how is it possible that their feedback switches from positive, to extreme negative in 2 weeks, and decide to fire me without even giving me a warning first ? what if I was sick or had issues ?  


now December is coming, I don't have client, it's hard or almost impossible to find because of the end of the year, and my employer will take advantage of this to screw me during the end of the year salary negotiations. The funny thing now is that he's throwing at me some roles that have nothing to do with my skillset... also switching to another company is very delicate for me because of my work permit (the new company have to make another one for me).  


All I'm asking for is a job/client that doesn't treat expats/externals like cockroaches, with relatively modern technologies that help me grow with my career, and a team that knows what they're doing when it comes to software engineering.

I was stressed from feeling like I was letting my team down all the time and left voluntarily. 

It wasn't too long until I found myself another job. This one was for a slightly smaller place for less money but I didn't really mind. I'm not aiming for a 6 figure salary in my 20s. Its been a bit over a year now though and I'm feeling a similar way. I think iv done better than my last job but I really just want to start all over. It kind of seems like the easy way out is to just look for another company, try hard with them and see if were a good fit.

I'm not massively concerned about career progression. I'm not a super money orientated person and I feel like I'm slowing improving my skills over the last 2 years even if the jobs didn't work out.

38,Aspiring SWE with a few questions.,"Hello. 

So I graduate in the Summer of 2022, My major isn’t computer science but rather CIS. We don’t take DS/A (Data Structures and Algorithms). 

I left my CS major thinking I don’t want to be a SWE, but now as a senior I’m realizing now that I want to be a SWE after all. 

I somehow landed an interview with FAANG as a SWE but I’m quickly realizing that without learning Data Structures and Algorithms, I’m going to fail any technical interview. 

I’m just so lost on where to start to learn on my own, and I have a few options. 

-Graduate and try to teach myself/take a online course for DS/A. Find a job that won’t box me in. 

-Take an extra semester at school and take DS/A. 

Does anyone have any tips? I’d like to say I have a fairly good understanding with Java, and could teach myself if I found the right tool, but it’s so hard to know where to start. 

Should I just take the extra semester? 

Is there a good “stepping-stone” position I could go to while I take a few classes post grad? I don’t want to box myself out of being a SWE. I know being a fresh post grad/soon to be grad is one of the best ways to get hired. 

Is there any advice on how to pass my FAANG code screening? It’s in less than 10 days.

48,Re-enrolling in university to get an internship,"Hi everyone.

You might have seen posts about me not being able to get a job, so my mother and I devised a plan.  

So I studied at a PA state school, which if you know anything about the actual state schools in PA, was pretty underfunded for anything outside of education, criminology, and nursing majors.  One of the consequences of this was a largely useless ""internship coordinator"" for the math and cs department.  I remember when I went to him during my sophomore year to see if he could help, he refused.  He explained that internships were meant for juniors.  I applied myself for that summer and didn't get anything.  Flash forward to my junior year and the internship coordinator showed me how to Google ""Computer Science Internship Pittsburgh.""  So anyways I was back on my own again and never got an internship for the summer between my junior and senior year either.

So now, 6 months out of college, I have no experience and the job search is largely hopeless.  My plan was to enroll in a better funded school, which will probably be Pitt so that I can commute and spend as little money as possible.  I would enroll as an undergrad working towards a software engineering major (they didn't have engineering at the school I went to, just CS).  The only point in me doing this would be to speak to the internship coordinator and see if he could help me out.  Then, once I have an internship lined up, I'll drop out and complete the internship.

Does this sound reasonable?  Specifically, I wanted to know about the usefulness of internship coordinators at larger schools with better funding.  Do internship coordinators help significantly with the internship search?",cscareerquestions,1636389086

Multimedia is everything I want to do in life, and the idea of transferring to that course hasn't left my mind since going to university, but I'm unsure about my future if I pursue this degree.

60,I am having difficulty deciding whether or not to accept a job offer and seeking finance/career advice,"I am an engineer for a large company and I work in an intersection between hardware and software. I earned both undergraduate and masters degrees in mechanical engineering, though I have been seeking to transition into software development for some time. I enjoy my job and what I do, I believe within 6-12 months there is a potential for me to transition into a software development role (with remote work) that could set me up for what I want to do long-term (working on perception/computer vision software).

I applied to several positions early on to put out feelers and honestly brush up on my interviewing skills. After some time one position got back to me for a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) working on controllers for a smaller aerospace company in Seattle (they had cold called me and I had followed through on the idea of an SDE position but hadn't thought much of it until they actually sent me an offer).

----------

So just as a point of comparison for my current position and offered position:

Current Position --

Location: Detroit Metro Area

Base Salary: $95,000

Bonus: $9,500

Stock: $0

401k: Contributions matched up to 5% (already vested)

Other: 5 more vacation days than other position and educational reimbursement fund

Total Annual Compensation: $104,500 + $4,750 to 401k

---------

SDET Position --

Location: Seattle

Base Salary: $140,000

Bonus: $0

Stock: $30,000 over four years, each year vested at 25%

401k: No Matching

Total Annual Compensation: $147,500

--------

While the nominal value for the offered position is higher than my current position, I know that even with no state income tax the cost of living in Seattle is much higher. While I can use online calculators to get a decent idea of what that difference looks like, I was wondering if someone with actual experience going from Low Cost of Living to High Cost of Living areas could really tell me if I'll feel a standard of living change here. 

The other aspect of this is career trajectory. I have heard that once in an SDET position you tend to be pigeonholed there and can have difficulty transitioning to dev. My other concern is that this position actually takes me farther from my career goal than my current position, though it could give me the opportunity to continue to work on my development skills for the next position.

I have been working daily on my dev skills, doing online classes, books, and coding/interview resources online.

72,"Do you ever take a ""slow week"" when WFH if you start to feel burned out?","So, I've started working from home about 8 months ago. So far I've been using pomodoro technique to measure the amount of actual focused work (that is, any kind of work that requires brainpower, without counting any kind of break). I started with over 6 hours of it a day of full focus. Over time, reaching 6 hours started to get harder and harder, to the point that some days I struggle to even reach 3 hours of real work. Days feel way longer, weeks feel eternal, and weekends don't do much: I start the Monday already feeling really not into the grind already.

I work on a very big project for a mid-sized company, with no deadlines, and so far I've gotten good performance reviews. But I'm afraid that this is a downward trend and the last time I've felt like this (on an open office code-all-day-for-something-that-ends-up-scrapped job) I ended up quitting a few months after without having another job lined up because I was burned the hell out. This is a good job, I do not really want to quit, but it keeps slowly getting harder to just do my job.

So, I'm considering my options. I could keep pushing on and hope this downwards trend does not keep going until I quit or I'm fired. I'm out of PTO. Unpaid time off is not a possibility. And quitting is a very last resource: this is a good job that respects my time on an interesting project, I want to be able to keep doing it like I did at the start.

So, as taking time off is not an option, I've thought about taking some time, say, one or two weeks, where I slow down to an almost ""maintenance mode"": working maybe 2-3 hours a day, then taking the rest of the day off, still paying attention to slack and mail. The idea is that I stop the downwards trend and I'm able to go back to a good working pace. I do not feel good about working 2-3 hours and logging 8, but I need to do something about this.

73,I hate my job and don't know what to do,"Hello, fellow Redditors,

To people who moved from test automation position to developer position - what's your story? How did you manage to make a move?

I'm a test automation engineer with more than 5 years of experience. I started to work with it by accident - I was looking for my first dev role but the company was also looking for someone to do test automation for them. I accepted that offer with thinking that I will work as a test automation engineer for a short time and it will help me to jump to the developer position soon. 

And I was wrong, really wrong. Currently looks like it's a dead-end for me and I don't know if I can move out of it anyhow. I worked for a few companies but always as TAE. 

I hate test automation, I don't find it interesting or developing for me and it feels for me that level of knowledge needed to work as a regular tae is lower than as regular dev.

In my current team fortunately I can do more than just automation - I'm working on some internal web app, on customization of Raspberry Pi Linux image to meet our needs (RPi is our test runner) - and I love it. But these are only temporary tasks and soon I will have to go back to writing tests and even if I will have the possibility to work with it more, I will still be a ""test automation engineer"".  
Next thing about working with these things not related to testing now - I'm doing it at a basic level. WebApp - do some really easy CRUD, Linux - write some easy bash scripts, pack it to deb package and run as systemd service. And even I know there is a lot more to learn about it I just can't dive into it - there isn't enough space for it.

I know, I know - I can work on all of this in my free time. But... I don't have free time. I'm spending time with my kids and it takes almost my whole time, I have 1-hour max in the evening and even if I start to do something it's just too little time to make any visible progress. Also - maybe it's just a lack of my imagination but I can't find any idea to work on some things I'd like to learn more.

And about dead-end. I think I could now jump to a dev role but it will need me to accept quite a much lower salary for some time (only because my current role is not a developer but test automation engineer).

76,Qutting job mid project due to mental health,"After taking \~6 months to find a job in the aftermath of covid, I finally managed to snag one. However, after about 5 months in I started to have severe panic attacks and anxiety/depression. I would dread going into work and it leaked into the rest of my life. I've been at the job for a year and a half now, so around 8-10 months of mental health issues. 

I'm in the middle of a big project where I'm the sole programmer for my parts/modules. I have taken one day off in my entire time here. Every developer here works till 9-10pm (my previous boss sometimes used to work till 4am) because their deadlines for projects are way too tight and they never assign enough developers to a project and they never really have anyone organizing them (I never work overtime I refuse to do it, but I hate being in a company where it is the norm). As an example, on my current project, the Backend developer has had to pick up UAT/Deployment because, well, nobody else is assigned to do it and it must be done. So he works late nights almost every night (completely managements fault). 

I don't work particularly hard and have barely any oversight. They just give me a 2 month long project so I can do my work as I please (I can spend some days doing absolutely nothing). I feel like I'm the only one who gets away with not working that hard

Basically, I hate the job and don't think I want to be a programmer at all anymore. I hate sitting infront of a computer all day coding boring ass company code and dread living my entire life as a 8-6 drone. I'm also severely underpaid. I started on an average grad salary and got a 10% raise after my first year which from what I have heard is severely underpaid for what I do (programmer).

From this job I've picked up huge social anxiety and have panic attacks when I go out with friends or into any social situation really. I dread going into the office and avoid social situations a lot. Basically its ruining my life.

I live with my parents and don't pay many expenses and also have a large savings from working for the past year and a half. Also have about 5 weeks vacation days stacked up.

What are your thoughts on quitting during a huge project? I feel I would let my team members down who would have to pick up the slack and work late nights to cover for me. However right now I don't have rent to pay or anything and am young so I feel my life and mental health are much more important. I hate working here and I'm thinking of going back to Uni to study something I might enjoy.

77,Electrical Engineering or Computer Science?,"I have to decide what I am going to major in soon like a few days at max, and I have narrowed down my options to CS and EE since the only field I wanna go into is technology, whether the technology is AI, machine leraning, programming(not sure if I like it I have no previous experince with it) and just technology in general cause I truly believe that technology is only gonna get more advanced and more dominant and I honestly it is the only field I like and interests me.

What I want to know is which one of them has more job options and which one of them is a better degree to major in (I know this is subjective but just in general) and how do they fair with time (as in will they get better in time and how well will the degree treat you when you get older) I know the degree isn't everything too but just to get your foor in the door but still I want something good to major in.

81,"Coming from an Engineering background then becoming a SE &amp; DS, it's become apparent that many of you would be happier being engineers.","I obviously don't speak for all engineers, but being an engineer in the working world and getting decent (SE and DS are definitely higher) salaries is SIGNIFICANTLY mentally easier.

I find as a DS/SE, I'm constantly having to update my skills, read new research and just basically trying to stay afloat in a VERY competitive field.

I used to be an engineer, I worked for 8 years in 3 companies on Radio chip design, digital electronics and routers.

Engineering life was FAR FAR easier.

Learning complicated shit was definitely necessary, but once you did it, you'd be set for at least 1-2 years before another paradigm shift in tech happens. Most of your work is spent analyzing results (which is why I got into DS as I was doing a lot of excel sheet DA and modeling). 

People also seemed to respect you more when you say you're an engineer versus a Software Engineer or Data Scientists (they often have no idea what that career is about, so I just say AI).

&amp;#x200B;

Now that might have been my experience in those 3 companies, however a fella at my office used to be a Mechanical Engiener at Lockheed Martin and he said the same. Engineering was FAR easier.

I think a lot of you who struggle with Computer Science and the Dev world would love being an engineer.

The degrees are hard, probably harder than Computer Science, but the quality of life, job satisfaction and just the routineness of that career (vs SE which is different all the time) is a better.

88,Should I delay my graduation to Fall 22 over Summer 22?,"I'm on track to graduate with my B.S in Summer 2022, but feel it's a bad time. I have one more class to finish in Summer 2022, which means I'd have to potentially balance an internship or job with a class.

A professor of mine said I could go PT to FT, or a company might wait for me (pessimist in me doubts this part). Someone else said Fall/Winter hiring is bad due to all the holidays. Or they do like hiring them because of extra money or something....no idea. 

Graduation in Summer 2022 means I'd probably be in a hiring low. I'd have to do some sort of productive grind for months until at least New Years, meaning there's a resume gap (unless I say I took time off to vacation or something). Could have benefits like time off and self improvement and all. 

Delaying graduation could mean I could get hired after the Winter 2022 holidays. I could also do an internship in Summer 2022 to add to my resume/experience. And take more classes in Fall 2022 to gain more skills and knowledge.

89,"As a junior level low-code developer, I want to get into machine learning. What should my roadmap look like?","As a junior level low-code developer, I want to learn machine learning. What should my roadmap look like?

My background: I studied business in college and dabbled with intro level courses like python and Java (literally the basic syntax) and also with web development. I am now an Appian developer (low-code) on a government client team making management systems. 


I’ve never taken any advanced CS classes in school but I was trained to code in Appian for my job out of college. Although the Appian platform is marketed as low-code, there is a lot of coding involved (Appian uses a scripting language called SAIL) to create interfaces and functions so I’m not a complete beginner and have a decent grasp at thinking logically when writing code (at least relative to fresh beginners). That being said, I’m not sure if I want to continue on this path for the rest of my career. I find the work boring and slow. However, I do want to stay in CS as I love the problem solving aspect of it. I’ve been researching career paths for CS and just reading the descriptions of each fields. Out of all of them, machine learning has peaked my interest. I want to start learning but as a complete beginner, I’m not sure what language to start with and what courses to take.

It'll be up some by the end of spring (let's call it ""sophomore year"") and definitely up by the end of ""Junior"" year, but if I wanted to try and get a 2022 summer internship would it be a killer thing?

93,I'm losing interest in programming and now I don't have a clue what to major in.,"So I'm currently a freshman in college and I am slowly losing interest in programming. The main reasons are currently I'm taking basic level programming classes anyone should be able to learn as all engineering majors are in the class, many people in my class are even bored because they already know these things. I was fine at first but recently as the class is starting to end I realized I wasn't as good as I wanted to be as I got a low B on an exam, completely failed a homework assignment, and have been getting C's and B's on the recent quizzes . I had no idea on how to even approach the assignment, very different to how I easily completed such assignments in the start of the year. After coming to this realization I asked myself am I really going to be pursing this for the next 3 years and I knew it would be at least three times harder than the course I'm currently taking. I could try harder in studying, but after this I lost all motivation to try learning because I lost the fun I had in programming and the drive to learn more. Now I have no idea what major to pursue, any thoughts?

I have been able to maintain a decent GPA(3.8+) but starting this semester I started taking up two CS-related part-time jobs for my university and they both involve interesting work that I personally enjoy and believe will be useful for my resume as well. However, being involved with two part-time jobs while trying to maintain good grades has gradually become a struggle for me.

I want to keep the two part-time jobs but as of now I am considering at least dropping one of them if not both starting next semester so I can focus on academics again, however, I am not sure if the tradeoff is warranted. I was able to get a summer internship offer for one of the FANGG companies for this coming summer, which I believe is partially due to my part-time jobs that are CS-related.

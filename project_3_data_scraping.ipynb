       "Hi all,\\n\\nBy way of introduction, I'm WallStResumeWriter - I've been fortunate enough to land a front-office job at a top bank on Wall Street (apologies for the anonymity, never know who's reading this!). Candidly, getting here was a challenge - I interviewed with, many leading bulge bracket investment banks and couldn't figure out why I kept getting rejected. \\n\\nTo get my current job, I had an epiphany that I needed to find new ways to stand out from the pack of candidates, especially as I didn't have the good fortune of coming from a top school. I figured out an optimal resume format, new ways to apply and highly differentiated ways to answer interview questions. In fact, when I interviewed with my current company, they had told me they were so impressed that they ended up waving the pre-hire modeling exam and I skipped both rounds of interviews with HR! (yes, seriously...)\\n\\nAfter getting my job, I volunteered to help others at my university - I helped students write highly differentiated resumes, get interviews, prepare for interviews and write excellent thank-you notes. After helping land several students jobs, I realized I might be on to something.\\n\\nAt my current job, I decided to volunteer to help with recruitment. After going through hundreds of resumes and being on the other side of the process, I have a really good understanding of what banks are looking for and how to stand out/get in. \\n\\nEntrepreneurship is something I'm passionate about and have always wanted to start a business. With that, I've decided to try my hand at writing resumes and coaching for those trying to break in. Whether you're in college trying to land your junior year internship or first full-time position, or already working and looking to lateral in from big four, management consulting or other areas of finance, I'm confident I can help you. I can also help those trying to get into big four (I landed a full-time offer with one of them in advisory).\\n\\nMy initial thoughts are that I'd like to charge $100 to do a custom resume from scratch, or will charge $30 for a 30 minute call. My thinking is that to build a strong resume, it'll take \\~2 hours, possibly more depending on the person, plus I'll need to do a bit of back and forth to ensure I've incorporated everything. I figure $50 per hour is fair and reasonable. If you are interested, I'd be happy to chat/message before you commit to using my service. And for those seriously interested, I'd be happy to provide examples of my work and more on my background (what bank, school, gpa, etc.).\\n\\nIf interested or have any questions, please email me at [WallStResumeWriter@gmail.com](mailto:WallStResumeWriter@gmail.com).\\n\\nAs a final thing, I understand that many of you reading are probably not convinced of the value this service provides. $100 is a lot of money. I agree with that. But, I truly believe the value I can bring is worth it. I do believe that I can seriously improve your chances of getting your resume pulled from the pile - after all, I've been responsible for pulling resumes at my current job - I know what to look for! I do believe I can get you prepared to navigate technical questions. And I do believe that I can help you to get interviewers to remember you.\\n\\nThanks for reading. I look forward to hopefully working with some of you!      3\n",

       "Is Afterpay trustworthy and good for a young person who doesn’t want to get credit cards or anything like that. I have the money to buy a $100 purchase but I would rather pay small amount ($22) in four different payments so as I get my paychecks every week a small amount gets taken out. I was wondering if I can just pay it all off at once with no penalties if I decide to or if I let it take out the money when it’s scheduled to with no penalties. It just sounds too good to be true so I don’t want to get scammed or afterpay have some weird guideline that cause me to go into debt. I’m just very paranoid and want to know if it’s a good idea, I have just recently become more independent from my parents so I’m still learning things. Please help or tell me your experience with after pay!

       "The title is my question. I wanted to make a solid attempt to pay my house off ASAP, but Im wondering if I should start putting the savings into an account instead. I havent started a Roth IRA yet and that was my next plan, but Im wondering if I should start on that first. \\n\\nBackground is I'm 25, make about 50k/yr and owe about 112k on my house which was appraised in april for 240k, I believe. I have a 30/yr mortgage and my payments are less than $500/mo. The way I was saving to accomplish my goal was to make \"double payments\" where I was taking the payment out of my check every 2 weeks. 1 went toward the mortgage and the other went into a savings account. This was also a secondary emergency fund so if something came up, I could make my house payment no matter what. \\n\\nUltimately my goal was to pay off my current house, and then buy another house in my hometown that was more towards what and where I wanted, and to then rent my current house out.\\n\\nHowever I'm wondering if I should take the savings Im making and open an IRA to get that ball rolling instead. As it sits, I can max out the IRA for the year in one contribution, and I feel I should be able to save and do that again the next year, and so on.\\n\\nThis is probably a no brainer and I see the logic in starting the IRA now instead of later, now. However Im still kind of torn on the execution of such. Im still new to the investing thing, aside from the couple of apps Ive recently started playing with. I just want to plan for my future in the most efficiently gainful way, and Im at a fork in the road and cant decide which way I want to kick the can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "Hi all, I recently got an Apple Card (September). I always pay off my balance back to 0 frequently, but at the beginning of September I made a big purchase that was about 2.4k of my 2.5k credit limit. Though I paid my balance the next day or so, Apple already reported by $2.4 out of 2.5k credit card utilization to the credit union. I checked on Credit Karma and that alone brought down my 761 credit score down to 670! \\n\\nI made sure not to repeat this, and my next credit report will probably show 0-10% credit utilization. Would this bring back my credit score all the way back to 761, or would it have to take more months (if so, how many 🤒)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
       "Hi,\\n\\nI have been trying to wrap my head around the 2 and could use some guidance. Let's say a person has maxed out their roth basic ($19.5k) for the year. The tax guru says, you can now do after-tax contributions as you can contribute another $38,500 (max $58k) for 2021 to after-tax account. My question is: how is this different than just pulling the money out and putting in your traditional brokerage account and buying (and forgetting) funds there? Is there another tax advantage I am missing with this after-tax option?

       "So I have a bit of a dilemma and am searching for advice:\\n\\nI am about to turn 26 years old, I have no education other than a couple of random community college courses, and currently no savings.  I've recently gotten a small pay raise that will allow me to change that last one, although the max I can save will be about $700 per month. My parents' financial situation growing up was such that they couldn't contribute anything towards college, and due to one parent being manipulative and abusive (some kind of narcissistic personality disorder as near as we can tell) living at home while going to school wasn't an option. So, I moved out as soon as I could and went to work full time.  I'm now in a slightly better spot due to getting a promotion/raise and I want to work towards getting my degree. At the number of hours I need to work, I could take at the absolute max 2 classes per quarter, so it would take me a very long time to finish my degree.  This wouldn't bother me, except for this next part.\\n\\nMy mom, who is approaching her sixties, has no savings or assets of any kind (she rents), no degree, makes minimum wage, her health isn't amazing, and she lives paycheck to paycheck.  She is still raising my youngest sibling, and to compound things, is about to get married to someone who is older than she is, who also has very limited earning potential and minimal savings. \\n\\nSo my dilemma is this:\\n\\nI really want to go to school, study something that interests me, and try to make a career out of it. But, I know that my siblings and I are my mom's only retirement plan and I feel I should just keep working and save as much as I can. Getting an education that will increase my earning potential is a better long term plan, but considering how long it will be until I am actually able to benefit from it has me worrying that something like a major health issue is going to come up sooner than later and I won't be able to help.  So what does everyone think? Should I just go for it and hope for the best? Or should I get some sort of short-term certification I'm really not interested in just to increase my income? Or should I just keep working full time and saving as much as I can and hope I get the opportunity to go to college sometime in the future?  Have any of you been in the same position? If so, what did you do and how did it turn out? What do you think would be the smartest decision I could make?  Thanks in advance:)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

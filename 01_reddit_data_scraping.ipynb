       "Please use this thread to have discussions about the Big N and questions related to the Big N, such as which one offers the best doggy benefits, or how many companies are in the Big N *really*? Posts focusing solely on Big N created outside of this thread will probably be removed.\\n\\nThere is a top-level comment for each generally recognized Big N company; please post under the appropriate one. There's also an \"Other\" option for flexibility's sake, if you want to discuss a company here that you feel is sufficiently Big N-like (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, etc.).\\n\\nAbide by the rules, don't be a jerk.\\n\\nThis thread is posted each **Sunday and Wednesday at midnight PST**.

       "As a 27 year old I have, out of completely nowhere, developed an incredibly detrimental procrastination habit. I have had a remote job with a flexible schedule and a forgiving boss for over a year now. I can take time off pretty abruptly and even when I'm expected to work a certain amount of hours, it's by month and not week (so I can work 30 one week and 50 the next week instead of \"clocking in\" for example). The downside is I'm not paid as well as I could elsewhere, but I value the flexibility quite a lot, and the pay is still good. \\n\\nIn the past 3-4 months, for whatever reason, I have been unable to even look at the work without getting exhausted. The idea of it turns me into a slug, mentally and physically, and I end up doing like 12 hours of work monday through friday. This leads to intense catch up on the weekend. Even up until Sunday afternoon, I may have like 30 hours of work to do and talk about in our meetings. This leads to staying up all night on Sunday to do some 17 hours of work, and then I just tell them I worked the 30 over the weekend. Then I try to make up the rest the next week. \\n\\nIn the past month, I have been stopping the all nighters because it's fucking me up in a lot of ways and probably making me less focused too. I was starting to have issues digesting food well and that was the end of the all nighters for me. \\n\\nIt's not just that I'm playing video games or doing something fun. It's that  would rather do anything other than start work. Any question on my mind drops work completely and needs to be researched. I would rather read shower curtain reviews than work. Even in a distraction free environment, it is very easy for me to procrastinate. This is really strange to me, because I wouldn't say the work has gotten less fulfilling. But my gut feeling is I'm so afraid of doing a bad job or being seen as a subpar programmer that I don't want to even start the work. This is a trait I have always associated with people either in bad work environments where they are punished for non-perfect solutions, or new programmers who never really learned its okay to fail (and programming often means tiny failures adding up to successes). \\n\\nThis isn't really anything my boss is doing. He's really forgiving and wants to teach me things. And I have always liked breaking things in programming and learning how it all works, and I'm not afraid of errors or recognizing the code I wrote wasn't the best way to write it. So I am not sure why I suddenly feel this way. I suspect it's because I feel like I should be better at this by now, or the kind of work I'm doing has more ambiguous goals. Or that I have the idea of a promotion in mind and I'm worried I'll fail to get it. Maybe I just know I can get away with it subconsciously (although it makes me feel like a useless piece of shit and I miss learning things). I really don't know, but I clearly have had a big mental shift in how I view work and it's keeping me from wanting to even get started. \\n\\nIt's also possible I am having bigger issues. I am not depressed in anyway, but I definitely used to be a person who would shoot out of bed as soon as I woke up, excited to read about something or play something. Now I linger in bed for at least an hour before I can even imagine getting up. I am wondering how this changed so suddenly (even when I had depression, I was a pretty proactive person, and I'm a lot better now). I used to work out more, and that could be another cause. \\n\\nHas anyone ever had sudden shifts in attitude like this? Is it just a part of getting older? Or is it a symptom of something deeper? I just want to be productive again.      1\n",
       "I’m currently in an apprenticeship scheme as a software developer and nearing completion of the course. I want to progress onto a degree and it may be possible that because of my studies, I can progress directly into the second year of the three year course. \\nThe only thing putting me off this is the feeling that I could miss out on some important modules that could help me in my second and third years. I’ve already had 1.5 yrs industry experience working on projects but I just wanted to get a bit of advice on whether this is worth doing or not?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

# Project 3: Reddit Web Scraping Classification

### Description

Business Use Case: AMA Recruiting specializes in recruitment for technology companies and wants to develop a classification model using Natural Language data from a publicly available forum data source

They want to use this classification system to find the most relevant threads online to distinguish general “financial” thread questions and threads related to computer science careers to develop targeted ad campaigns for potential hiring candidates


### File Structure
In the file structure, there exists two folders: data and images. Data contains the output and any intermediary csv's between the various stages of the process. The images folder contains the output images of the Exploratory Data Analysis. 
3 main notebooks are: 

1) project 3 data scraping
2) project 3 eda (exploratory data analysis)
3) project 3 modeling

### The process of the work:

1) Gather Data 
2) Data Cleaning and Processing
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4) Building Machine Learning models
5) Evaluating our Models
6) Making Conclusions about our Findings

### Conclusions:

Machine learning Classification is a valid way to distinguish corpus text (using NLP). From our dataset and specific modeling used for binary classification in this context, Logistic regression is a better model for the situation at hand for targeted messaging for CS hiring candidates.
